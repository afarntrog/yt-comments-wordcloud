KD went to a stacked organization, with established creds (ring), a star-studded team and want to be thee top star or should I say the only star.  It&#39;s not even clear if KD could win without strong support.  KD, KI has to be related they both cry big sobbing, snot nose tears for what they already had but gave away.  Just have to have that name in front.  Good luck Nets....KD after 2 titles with GS quoting Bono of U2: &quot;But I still, haven&#39;t found, what I&#39;m lookin for...&quot;Basically saying  Kendrick Perk is full of shit.   What else did he want GSW to do for his ass.  As great a players as he is.  I question some of the shit he does.  I wish him all the best and I hope he heals up and comes back even better than he was.  But leaving GSW because they didnt kiss yo ass enough is busllshit.   I wish he just say thanks for the rings. I needed that. But now I want my own.   Don’t blame it on GSWbob Myers made a joke about steph curry earning a big contract from the warriors because he was there from the beginning. They also told Kd he wouldn&#39;t get more hurt if he played. They also tried to force iguadola to play and that Draymond argument was beyond disrespectful. Why sit there and act like the warriors were perfect and didn&#39;t make mistakes. Kd gone to Brooklyn and the warriors did take him for grantedKD the type of guy who doesn&#39;t feel appreciated if his teammates aren&#39;t giving him foot massages.Perk should stick to what he knows best. Retirement.Who is Kendrick Perkins?90% of the bay knew KD was leaving this was always Steph team KD was the man like LeBron in Miami but it was still Wade team.Kds the 3rd most important player on that team but klay nd steph are 1st. #2 golden state DID HIM A FAVOR!!He didn’t just leave the Thunder he killed the ThunderKevin is a crybaby! It’s all about Kevin!!Durant could potentially have the all time worst contract in sports history and nobody will care for at least 2 years.Kevin Durant is a momma&#39;s boy, those guys are like princesses who&#39;ll find a needle in a haystackKevin needs a wife and kids to feel rightPerk is still mad curry told him he’s healthy in a suit. What were they supposed to do suck him off every night?why does Chris look likes he&#39;s been lost in the desert for two weeks?You can say KD took Golden State for granted. He wasn&#39;t loyal to the fans, the city, the Warrior management. He shopped himself around to find a greener pasture. He certainly has that right, but it is immature of KD to think he would receive the warmest, loudest, longest standing ovation from Oakland as he was leaving the building for Brooklyn.I mean it took a injury for his team and the media to respect him. Everyone was saying just play just play! Now he’s out a whole seasonHe&#39;s trying to get away from his mom. He isn&#39;t his own man yetCan we stick to the Draymond factor?????These GSW media personnel who on their payroll...🤔🤔.... controlling that narrative...KD is as soft as 1ply toilet paper...classic case of a guy who is never satisfied/happy (female traits).The first year, Steph took less shots and his stats took a hit across the board. So much so to figure out how to play alongside with KD, since the system always surrounded Steph. Draymond sacrificed his shots, Klay embraced his role as the third option. You don’t just simply claim you feel taken for granted. Take some time instead and think in other people shoes, not just yourself. Y’all keep talking about the injury and decision to make him play like you were in there making the decisions. Like KD didn’t have his own doctors. The man is 30 years old and competes. We don’t know what was said off the court. Keep speculating and pile on how 100% it was the Warriors that made him quit. Couldn’t it be he had already other plans? Never occurred to you that he is a drifter and constantly needs a change of environment to keep himself happy? He’s sensitive and everyone knows that’s If you talking about basketball standpoint, doesn’t even make sense playing with Kyrie would be more successful compared to the Splash brothers. Sometimes y’all just have to accept this is just the kind of person he is instead of some conspiracy. Of course KD camp would appreciate all this back story to justify him leaving unlike when he left OkC. And we haven’t even talked about his time in OKCKevin Durant is a snake 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍motherfuker but you guys hate LeBron so much this dude wants to be like LeBron so much it&#39;s ridiculous f*** Kevin Durant❌ Dray called KD a bitch and told him &quot;We don&#39;t need you, we won without you.&quot; Even dared him to leave.<br /><br />❌ (2018 Championship Parade)<br />Bob Myers and Steve Kerr were standing alongside television play-by-play man Bob Fitzgerald. “I heard you tell Kevin Durant he could have whatever contract he wants next year,” Fitzgerald said to Myers.<br /><br />“That was just for the media. He can’t have anything like that at all,” Myers said. Kerr interjected: “Mid-level.”<br /><br />“I think last year you told Steph (Curry) he could have any contract he wants, too,” Fitzgerald said.<br /><br />“Yeah, that was different. He’s been here from the way-before days. He’s earned it,” Myers replied. Curry looked at Durant, who tried to laugh it off but clearly wasn’t amused by what was happening.<br /><br />❌ GSW medical staff claiming that his injury &quot;couldn&#39;t get any worse&quot;. Played 12 out of 14mins, with No Minutes Restriction! (factor in that Iguodala was diagnosed with a bone bruise in the 2018 playoffs when it was really a fractured leg lmao).<br /><br />3 STRIKES.. that nigga is out! 😂<br /><br /><b>waits for incoming KD is that you? Burner acct jokes</b> 👨🏾‍💻Rachel looking like a snackThis is why the fans love Steph……...KD left!<br />And why OKC love Westbrook more.....KD left!KD just seems like a an emotional dude always caught up in his feelings<br />like the type of dude to tell a girl he loves her on the first date and lock himself in his room when she never calls backDraymond Green Call Durant A Beeeech! Durant has to go. &amp; Get his OWN!!!!!💪🏿🤷🏾‍♂️KD needs wants fulfillment?  Get a GF or BF or whatever your preference is dude.  You&#39;ve done what you can in basketball already.  You need a relationship.Foh da Jersey Retirement ain&#39;t about respect, ITS about theY fcked up n KD blew his ACL bc of itPerkins needs to shut up with his pimping of KD. He Perkins was not a member of the Warriors how do he know what goes on . Kevin there is no pleasing him.EggChris Mullen was A Great BB Player for the Warriors.👻Grown ass man dangling his feet. Grow up Chris!!KD had zero rings before he came to GS.  KD is the best player in the league but I don’t think that he will ever find the perfect place and situation.  OKC took him for granted for 19 years.DURANT about to see what dysfunction really is when Kyrie diva side show up since he will be on a island by himself the first year. . Kyrie first year in Brooklyn will strengthen him as the Main Man.  DURANT will be a sidekick... Again.  He thought Russell selfishness was bad.  That crisp ball movement is dead. The defense...  The comeback mechanisms..  Hope he comes back healthy above all tho.KD hurt that warriors fans were cheering for Curry.. seriously? if Curry joined OKC and Durant, would Durant have been OK if OKC fans started cheering for Curry more than him? gimme a breakThey should put dude at the end of the row cuz he doesn’t turn to include Mullins in the convo 🌚Chris Mullin swinging his legs under the table from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3VG26TAhMM&amp;t=5m15s">5:15</a> on has me cracking up!!!!!!Kevin needs a come to Jesus moment that&#39;s what needs &quot;what profits a man if he gains the world but losses his soul.&quot;GS might not even make the playoffs next yearJust start having 3 numbers on jerseys.  Retired jerseys happens for everyoneIf anything Steph is the one being taken for granted.lol, poor kevin. if he still does&#39;t feel apriciated, he should work on his insecurities...Big ass goodies bring up LeBron missing Kyrie &amp; love but acting like raptors just beat the warriors fair &amp; square when they didn’t have KDHello im KD im the better MVP i swear i came here to grow by winning each game by 40 or soWarriors fans not watching the nba next year 😂😂😂😂Man I love KD no homo. He&#39;s just so real. Haters gonna hate though.Warriors got what they wanted from Kevin Durant made him do everything even play while injured for minimal pay and in return they gave him a worthless cheap ring<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3VG26TAhMM&amp;t=4m15s">4:15</a> chris kicks his feet like a kid :)fools feel like they can talk bad about a historically great team cuz they&#39;re pettyAmin cleaner than the board of health.He’s a drifter. He’s not going to be happy there either.  He’s putting out that he was a second fiddle to Steph. Well sitting out for a year. When Kyrie and D’Andre draw a much larger fan base in Brooklyn. He will be known as the Third wheel.  K. D did not leave GSW on a good note so I doubt if it works for him with the Nets. He’s already getting 2 strikes against him. (1) he wanted to go to the New York .  (2). His Achilles injury. <br />He was not committed to The Team.  <br />Now he’s teaming up with Iso players.    <br />When he was with GSW it looked like everyone was on the same page. Almost like a brotherly love for each other. <br />K.D fooled everyone.  <br />Good luck K.D being the 3rd wheel behind Kyrie and D’Andre.The organization respected him? Come on, nobody stood up for him when Draymond went off on him, they don’t give a damn about KD, just milked him for as much as they could🤷🏽‍♂️Why does Chris Mullin look like a skinny Brock LesnarMaybe he should seek the most high...Retiring his jersey? 😂😂😂😂I remember when you actually had to earn that shitTook him for granted? They completely changed the team play style too accommodate him. Even after he tore his Achilles they were still gonna give him a supermax contract. Meanwhile, he’s been plotting to leave since before this season🤣🤣😂. He didn’t wanna play here anymore, it’s that simple. Go away foreverYou dont offer someone a quarter billion dollars if you take them for grantedKawhi to Warriors for veterans minimum.This guy was a warriors legend, so he knows what he is talking about unlike perkinsDraymond should’ve no doubt passed KD the ball at the end of that game.No Championships in Brooklyn tho KevinLove Chris Mullin. Can Warriors sign him on a minimum this year? Bet he can still shootHow could he trust the medical staff and trainers after what happened ?How can y’all say that from the Draymond incident , and the pressure to put him in a situation that caused him a catastrophic injuryYeah right! After ruining his career and forcing him to play through injury!KD, Kawhi, Giannis etc, the east is looking tough for oncenext GSW jerseys to be retired.<br /><br /><br />#30<br />#11<br />#23<br />#9?So where is Iggy&#39;s retired number he got finals MVP right? He was a glue guy right? They did that cuz everyone looking at them crazy because of Thompson and Durant.I love Rachel’s fraudulent spin on Dray spitting in Kevin’s face pretending it was somehow respectWarriors fans definitely took him for granted. Y’all thought you could win without him until your team was down 3-1 in the finals 🤷🏾‍♀️Mostly its because of draymond trying to handle him and then misleading his medical condition which lead to his injury. In short his been mock and then tricked.Kd first 2 rings didn&#39;t mean shit the next 2 willI don’t blame KD for leaving. if other players secretly feeling like we don’t need you why would you want to stay on that team? If I don’t feel like I’m in a genuine environment I don’t want to be there. Going to New York was the best move for him because in NY we are genuine, whether we genuinely hate you or love you it’s genuine. I think he felt that fake energy from the GSW players and their fans and didn’t want to go through that anymore. Trust me he will feel real love in New York off and on the court.Warriors didnt need him in the first place.It was probably the fans tbh. All of those GSW fans (some real and some fake) were saying that the Warriors didnt need KD. Good luck with that. If the Lakers get Kawhi, nobody other than the Lakers is going to come out of the West for the next 3-4 years. The real GSW fans werent backing KD like they should&#39;ve. Nobody&#39;s going to play where they feel they arent wanted.Why does Chris Mullin sound like he&#39;s definitely from the hood?Chris Mullen is a smart dudeKD signed a short term deal for obvious reasons.  Why spin it any other way?  If he wanted to be there forever, why not lock in?While Andre gets shipped out lmaooo yea ok gsThe only person on Golden State that took Kevin for granted was Draymond. The rest of the organization rolled out the red carpet for him from the very startThey didn’t value him like Steph and the others. That’s a fact. They would never let Steph play on a hurt Achilles. They sacrificed Kevin.I wish somebody would pay me millions of dollars so I could feel taken for granted...I&#39;m just a fan. I love KDs game and I love Kawhi Leonard these two players are very similar the very unfortunate circumstances Kawhi managed to get traded and Kevin Durant&#39;s suffered Achilles injuryI bet behind the scenes KD low key obsessed with some chick and he’s tryna stay near her 😂🤷🏽‍♂️Lmfao he bout to find out he took them for granted when he dont win a ring in Brooklyn 💀none of my business though.This man look like the nigga who say sonic boom when he swing 😂😂😂Have a great day if you’re reading this❤️ (I would appreciate a sub)They sure did appreciate him and misdiagnosed him and possibly ended his career 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤥It&#39;s the media that took KD for granted.Ownership sided with weak ass non productive Dremon. Therefore KD leftGolden State rode KD until they broke KD. That was after having the attitude of ‘they didn’t need him’. Yeah of course he was out of there lolPerkins dont have no say so he sucked when he playedKendrick Perkins swear he know everything about kd and subjects about kd he dont know shitYou have two GSW dick suckers on the show, what do you expect them to say?What more could a player ask for?! Dude is mad the fans loved Curry more than him and really didn&#39;t grasp that GS is Steph&#39;s team, PERIOD.How did Golden State take KD for granted? They offer him a max contractI like intercourseThey wanted KD to be happy✊✊Sub to me
