This is kind of what SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink is doing so maybe not such a bad idea. Why is the sat at geosynchronous orbit distance anyway, since its not above the equator .

I believe companies like youtube spend a huge amount of money just to get their data stored in the centre , maybe the data on my website could be less comparatively , but still how come no one&#39;s charging me for using a server ??&quot;How does the INTERNET work?&quot;, short answer, it doesn&#39;t anymore, cos google is fucking useless, google not only put you in a search bubble but they also delete a quarter of a million links every weel cos &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t want you looking at whatever you choose, R.I.P freedomwhat is dale steyn doing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&amp;t=2m31s">2:31</a> ?üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªThank you sir ..Thank you.1 like= 1 ping lessYour welcome...‚ò∫Thanks.

That&#39;s why electricity and light can travel so fast.. It&#39;s a misconception that an electron has to travel x number of distance to reach point B from point A..Stop the garbage lies ......

It solidify what u learned here. Here u r <a href="https://medium.com/@User3141592/how-does-the-internet-work-edc2e22e7eb8">https://medium.com/@User3141592/how-does-the-internet-work-edc2e22e7eb8</a>What an excellent  explanation with pictures which surely stick very well.Thanks for sharing! Now i can build my own Internet with satellite!&quot;One thing I can tell you if you want to believe me that is that I am like a camaleon. I adapt to anything and survive and make it through. I can also tell you that what happened was also very painful to me beyond painful but like you I survived it. I know I don&#39;t know, and I never claimed I did or ever once said you liked me. It&#39;s so stupid again. I actually think the opposite that people don&#39;t like me lol. It&#39;s in the past now, <a href="http://and.im/">and.im</a> not there anymore but my advice is if you want one of course, don&#39;t share anything with the source because as you might know, it gets out. Safe travels..&quot;<br />From the book of Golliath&quot;I&#39;ve never assume someones feelings for me, and I know it is what was said. How stupid. I never once thought that, but looking and maybe over analyzing, the source was/is not that private, but I think that&#39;s now KNOWN.... I THINK and I&#39;m just guessing that it is loneliness... It is their way to bring attention to them no matter who they destroy in the process. Like If i moved somewhere, I would never tell them I don&#39;t know I just wouldn&#39;t... That&#39;s just me..&quot;<br />From the book of GolliathIt is best to know oneself than to try to know another. All we can is guess, and sometimes we are right, but understanding is a guess can keep us from dissapointment. Actually expectation is what gets us dissapointed. Like we assume someone hates us or likes us or is in love with us. One thing I learned since early in my life is not to assume because I am often wrong about people, and I know that. I focused on me. They often think though they know me that what they hear is me or that it must be so... Look at the source, is it even reliable, does it even past the test of privacy, you tell me... That&#39;s your source? Well..... You have no idea, and you never did.  even with what I THINK I know have no idea either but at least I know that. I, however, have a good idea of who I am and who I love, like, adore, can&#39;t live without. I know that very well. Extremely well.This video is too dumbed down. Example not every device has an ISP assigned IP address, RE: NAT and DHCP<br />It&#39;s a very important fact that is not addressedI love TechnologyGive  us more of this.Too complicate:(Very complexI still do not understand but it sounds coolCables, towers..over a level surface.Is that a mate X at the beginning?What&#39;s the software used to animate this video.excellent explanation..

That is the job of a modem = (mo)demThe equator does not run through Nova ScotiaThanks a lotNice introductory video that does not overwhelm the viewer with a lot of extraneous detail yet gives an accurate overview of the mechanics of the web.  Actually, the basics are not that hard to understand.  What we see on a webpage has to be sent to us by a string of ones and zeros which our device then reasembles and displays on our screens.  Those ones and zeros are represented by pulses of light traveling around the globe over mountains and under oceans through fiber optic cables which just consist of long strands of glass formed into bundles.  Remarkable that it all works reliably most of the time.You might as well use models using very tight underwear for the next video.how the satellite and optical fibre work together in order to transmit data?Thank you very.much for the information godbless u from the Philippines üòáüòáüòáüëçüëçüëçüëçüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèThanks for sharing from Eritrean üá™üá∑It&#39;s amazing üòçI‚Äôm in europe and using vpnBest video on internet about the internetüíªDude, it&#39;s already 2019? üòêbrief and general without drrp details..no  OSI ,DHCP,ect...niceCan&#39;t we then ban China from using internet .

This guy surely is not able to surf the web. First, his IP adress should start like 192.168.1. and second did you invent IPv3 with this 152.222.122 ? Every IP adress in the internet is unique and every IP adress in every LAN is unique but there are millions of LANs in the world. Hope you get it, hard for me to explain this on english. Sorry but that is surely not simplified and also not a small mistake. 162.511 got taught completely wrong information, especially wrong about the only part everyone has to deal with.

I really liked it :)awesome explanation....i like this video very muchAmazingWell Explained sir thanks to u and ur team-mate for this videoüëèüëèüëèüëèTrying to figure out 0101 for the last 20 years.How is receiving internet via satellite plagued with latency? the waves are travelling at light speed and per second they are travelling 186282 miles. 44000 miles/186282 miles/sec leaves us with 0.236 sec of transmit time. I understand theirs a bit of back and forth communication using TCP but it really couldnt amount to THAT much latency issues, could it?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&amp;t=06m41s">06:41</a> that lady  is in the middle of the Amazon rain forest, but there&#39;s a helpful cellular antenna  nearby.<br />Thank you for these helpful videos, I&#39;m sharing this.Sorry but I enjoyed dat lady more than real stuff.GreatI remember the days before domain names... we&#39;d type out the whole numerical IP address... this would get us to the websiteyou made more clear than our data communication teacher lolSounds Greekü§®This was... greatly simplified.  The information was mostly accurate, but it glossed over huge, huge areas of detail.<br /><br />Like, this is how a car works:  First, in the Cambrian period, plants grow via sunlight and photosynthesis.  Those plants grow very large due to a high CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, but they eventually die and get buried.  Over time, they are convert into oil, which is processed into fuel which powers the car.  The fuel is converted into exhaust by the engine which flows through the catalytic converter and comes out of the tailpipe.  And that&#39;s how a car works!Your videos are perfect.Usually I think these are really interesting but I think you missed the mark on this one. Kind of boring.WTH, I thought it was a series of tubes.They say the internet is redundant and will reroute packets around broken links, but every fucking local or wide area network I&#39;ve seen uses a tree structure where any broken link will totally disconnect all the branches below it.    Back in the day you had token and ring networks with a little redundancy, but today with switches, I&#39;m not seeing it.So since wifi works through optical fibers, is the part that impedes your internet during say, a storm, is the router?Thanks, that was very helpful and easy to learnüëèüëçone thing you&#39;ve slightly overlooked in the specific case of video is the concept of content delivery networks. <br />A company like Google will have multiple &quot;pop&#39;s&quot; (points of presence) around the world and these can actually be embedded within your ISP&#39;s network to reduce the latency effect.<br />What these pops do is store a Cache or a local copy of the master file which would originally stored in a big data centre. So instead of the data having to travel thousands of miles to reach you it should only travel a few hundred or less depending on your location.so much inaccuracies, unbearable to watch.&quot;However, this way of transmitting signals is not a good idea&quot;<br />SpaceX: I&#39;m about to end this man&#39;s whole careerExcellent video. Where is DNS server located?Very clear <br />You are great sir<br />Thanks a lotWell, I have some complaints here. First, the animation shows hard disk drive (HDD), and it is correct. But you say it as SSD. Well, that&#39;s wrong. The datas are stored in bunch of HDDs, and the reason why HDD is used is because it is much cheaper and has higher capacity per dollar. Although it is slower than SSD, HDD&#39;s performance is actually quite enough for the server operation. Second, why the cable suddenly goes from the sea into the house? Wrong. The cable will be connected to the large station in each country, which provides internet service to ISPs, and then the ISP will provide the internet service to the customers. These things are not mentioned in the video.I liked this video...MORE SPECIFICALLY, I ENJOYED IT üòÇMr and Mrs DISLIKERS what you people dislike in this video?The thing is that , dislikers didn&#39;t understand what they said.thumbs down for the unnecessary large breastsThank you so much sir for your such a useful video again .......Love you from india ............Oh he says it as Da-ta.. I thought it is read as Day-Ta...You&#39;ll never learn as long as you are pronouncing &quot;Data&quot; like that.Awesome  Video ‚ù§Outstanding informationAmazing videowowwwUs humans are a very impressive species.amazing video bro i understanded the video very easily and thanks for making this video in animation type of videoReally, a excellent video. People like you helping people to understand various things.Amazing video, but as an I.T. student, I am 100% sure that packet does not contain only 6 bits. It is usually about 1500 Bytes I think (12 000 bits). If there would be only 6 bits of data in a packet, metadata (ip adresses, control protocols and many many more) would actually contain more than 90% of the whole packet. Therefore, sending for example 10 GB of metadata just to get 1 GB of actual data, would be very unprofitable.Qu√© maravilla de v√≠deo. Enhorabuena !Reduce the font of text at left bottom.Amazing content!Love u for good education<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&amp;t=4m23s">4:23</a> OMG, what&#39;s wrong with her eyes?!thank you very much <br />it is real learning <br />after watching this video <br />i loved communication engineering<br />from EGYPTOptical Fiber cable does not go from the seabed to your router. First of it has numerous routing points before that, but primarily a home router almost never have an optical port. <br />It either goes to a DSLAM, (an cobber line sentral if you will, in the case you have DSL line into your home) or if you have a fiber to your home, it will usually go to a modem first, then your home router.I simply can&#39;t imagine how fast these things are happening.this is great videoWe&#39;re doomed if there&#39;s a huge EMP or solar flare.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&amp;t=2m56s">2:56</a> She is the same sexy woman who drove a car in previous movies of this channel.Google banned huawei...üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅHow  will space X give high speed internet using starlink satellites?????Awesome videoThis explenation is incorrect in many aspects...1 year back in college I said this topic as seminar ,but no one understood due to my messy demonstration and my stupid voice üòê .. in between I missed that DNS thing!! .. such a nice video with animation ‚ù§Ô∏èThis is amazing! Thank you!out of all the devices, learn engineering decided to use samsung galaxy foldSimple but excellent explanation. I love this channel. So informative.Personal IP address is privacy information no one can get that legally.super video thanks sirnice explanation !!!THANKS FRIENDS THIS VIDEO IS VERY USEFUL FOR ME<br />PLEASE MAKE MORE VIDEOSI&#39;m so confused. What is a phone book? Can you explain that in the next video?dayumm, those are sum big ol&#39; tiddiesAh is a folding iPad!Well, this doesn&#39;t look like the box from the IT Crowd at all!Just wanna know where is Data Center located ?What about VPN network<br />How does that workgood lecture üëç, thank youI got some good idea..... ThanksAmazing ! <br />DNS and IP understanding will help me  a lot in using Internet as it often remain blocked in our area due to Indian Govt orders.RIP the Huawei foldable phone XDI understand how all of this works, but it never fails to amaze me. It‚Äôs crazy to think about the sheer amount of data that is transmitted every single day, let alone every single second. All of this created by humans. It really makes you feel like we are capable of so much more.Diversity maybe? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lemme guess ... if I don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t watch it.You lost it completely with IP addresses... ISP DOES NOT provide IP for any device you use inside a local network!!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&amp;t=3m00s">3:00</a>So if satellites are an inefficient method of transferring data, then why is SpaceX pursuing their StarLink internet system? from my current knowledge this system is supposed to decrease latency but if fiber optic cables are better, why bother?Amazingly well done!!Just to let people know, this is a very good surface level explanation of how it works, but of course things are waaaaaay more complex than that.<br /><br /><br />For instance, one thing that was reinforced multiple times through the video is the path between a data center and you, using watching a YouTube video as example.<br />But actually, services like YouTube that are incredibly huge actually has multiple datacenters distributed around the globe, and you are more likely not getting the data directly from those, but rather from midway points, potentially servers from other companies among other possibilities.<br /><br />It&#39;s a rather complex thing. For huge services like YouTube, the volume of data is so large and the need for speedy streaming is so big that there are series of algorithms and automated systems that will distribute data in a way to optimize for those things. YouTube also doesn&#39;t use only YouTube or Google servers... they can use Amazon ones, or ones from other companies.<br /><br />To get down to the latency and speed demands though, services also have local midway points storing the most acessed content to deliver it faster to costumers.Thank you Nicola TeslaAwesome . I learned a lotNice informationEverything is connected..connection is powerUltimate Video......What&#39;s an Internet?Awesome video! This reminds of the Eugene Physics videos but less weird lolThank you it was very useful informationProud to be network engineer üòä. In general it&#39;s good video.Seriously? You have got to be kidding. What a pathetic video. All of this information is all over the internet. Thanks for wasting my time. <br /><br />Really... Anyone who doesn&#39;t know this is not, in any way, interested in engineering. You&#39;re really wasting <i>your</i> time by producing such a video.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SaveYourInternet">#SaveYourInternet</a>why use miles???In other words we could transmit the internet via satellites but earth is flat and satellites are dumped in the ocean, so we use undersea cables üòÇUse the metric system pleaseDon&#39;t get the ones and zeroes part, how do you convert a video with different sounds, textures, and colors into a 1 and 0 signalThis video is sponsored by hp laptop <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&amp;t=2m24s">2:24</a><br />This video is sponsored by huawei mate X üòÇ(bye android)<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&amp;t=6m25s">6:25</a>this is just awesome vedio... <br />Thanks for this video...Please please explain / add how BGP and the relationship between many different providers to get those locations connected, because this is otherwise a great explainer :)Ilon Mask plz give us Global sattelite Wifinice<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&amp;t=4m05s">4:05</a> entire database centres dedicated to one site such as face book or youtube... pornhub has probably got its own personal data centreWhat I have been wondering my whole life.Were you listening? Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?thanks for the video explanation but i want to tell you somethings  that i see it&#39;s wrong and please anyone correct me if i am wrong:<br /><br />[1] you said &quot;each device has a unique ip address&quot;: but you didn&#39;t actually say is this address private or public, when you subscribe with an internet provider company they give to you a public ip and then when you connect to your router you have a private ip something like that (192.168.0.105) so every device connecting to your router has unique private ip address but same public ip address so there is a difference between a public ip and private ip.<br /><br />[2] you said &quot;dns keeps websites addresses <a href="http://www.sdf.com/">www.sdf.com</a> --&gt; 125.845.2.6&quot;: but actually they are designed more to give the nearest ip address to your network to lower your delay as for example google doesn&#39;t have one server but multiple servers around the world so here in Egypt for example i don&#39;t access the same server as same as one live in america unless this is the nearest server to me, and of course to not memorize the ip of the nearest to your website.<br /><br />[3] you said &quot;fiber optics is the backbone to the internet where they are connected to your router&quot;: but actually they go to my internet provider first and then my internet provider send it to me.<br /><br />[4] you refereed to a slide in the data center as the server : but actually its one unit called &quot;Node&quot; and group of them called a &quot;claster&quot; the server actually by a simple meaning &quot;any device even your device open a port in that device so one from outside can access it to put/take something from there&quot; so what you refer to is not the server it&#39;s actually one node.I really love this project.<br />thanks for upload this~How does hacking workI thought india uses metric system, or are you actually us company?normal consumer router doesn&#39;t have a media converter, you then have a seperate box that convert fiber signal to rj45<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&amp;t=3m12s">3:12</a> IP adresses like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x are private network addresses and are used only for local LAN communication (router in home assign this address with option for user to change it). All outside LAN request  are translated to public adres given by internet provider.I&#39;m a software engineer and I remember when we did this at school. It took us a couple of hours and nobody got it completely; now I got it in less than 10 minutes. We need to revise our education systemsNope, no better off üòïHow a processor worksthis is terrible.The lady in the red dress has very big and round internet skills.Always thought satellites were the main wayGreat.. thank youawesome explanation!!Great jobIs the lady in red single?That&#39;s an awesome informative update thanksThat&#39;s how youtube works: giant YouTube logo flying right into the server&#39;s Solid Hard Drive, which flying into the server. I don&#39;t understand why solid hard drive do not fly itself from server to server.Sir your this type of animation video is always osm and easy to understand thanks lot sir for this.Her bewbs are hugeIdk why everyone thinks internet works via satellites?So what you&#39;re saying is...it&#39;s like a series of tubestubesmetric units?Ok sirIs that mobile the folding phone made by Samsung electronics?Not bad explanation at all TBH.
