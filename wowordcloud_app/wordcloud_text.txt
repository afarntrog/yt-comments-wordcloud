Hi Gaurav  , can we have server id as one of the columns in the table and use that also while querying the DB , so that it picks only the undone orders by that server(dead server) only, and rest can be taken care by the load balancers which is distributing the load ?amazing series!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=2m21s">2:21</a> ahahahahahaha.Please make a video on Udemy System Designthis is awesome explanationPlease create a video over HermesJMS. This video was really helpful in getting the basics of MQYou are the best teacher. Thank you very much.Very confusingAmazing video.A very good videoHi Gaurav , Nice video with simple example. please make a video on ListenerAmazing work Gaurav, Keep inspiring!Last time, I was attending one interview and detailing similar restaurant example.<br />They have asked me, &quot;what is this design pattern?&quot;. But I said something that was incorrect.<br />I would like to drill down and identify all the possible design patterns with right examples (just in restaurant is sufficient).<br />Could any one help me on this?I love the turn in at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=4m09s">4:09</a>Do you have video for Disruptor? I am looking for your nice presentation.In my view, load balancing is not required here. It may be overkill. It is slipping from main concept of Message Queuebro, you doing wellHey Guarav, I am curious. If S3 (server 3) went down, can&#39;t traffic 9 and traffic 11 be identified as the ones that need rerouting if the database table had a column specifying which server it was routed to? That way we can query in the DB for requests that were lost by losing S3 instead of querying for all requests that have not finished yet.Pretty well explained.Hello, really grateful for ur video, really. But May I give u little suggestion ? I’m backend dev, and new to system design. Sometimes I can’t understand what u r trying to explain. U speak then u stop then speak then stop. I think maybe things would get better when u try to explain things more fluently ? Again, really grateful for ur videos. Just really want to understand every video u shares with us😬 thx!Hi Gaurav, In the video where we discussed about duplicating order no. &#39;3&#39; between S3 and S2, the S2 is still up and running right? So will there be a case where load from S2 should be distributed to other servers? Will we be doing load balancing even if the Server is active?These are some really good reads about how message queues can be used for both server failure and load balancing<br /><br /><a href="https://dev.to/matteojoliveau/microservices-communications-why-you-should-switch-to-message-queues--48ia">https://dev.to/matteojoliveau/microservices-communications-why-you-should-switch-to-message-queues--48ia</a><br /><a href="https://insidethecpu.com/2014/11/11/rabbitmq-qos-vs-competing-consumers/">https://insidethecpu.com/2014/11/11/rabbitmq-qos-vs-competing-consumers/</a><br /><br /><br />Since message queues work on publisher-subscriber model, we should also consider the case of load balancing at the publisher end like topic based/ content based load balancing.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern</a>I like the way you explain itI ordered pizza after watching this video😋That &#39;filling up the coke can&#39; face! LOL :D - thumbs up for a great video explanation!Thank You Gaurav for the video...I was wondering in a typical system design where does the messaging queue reside? Going by the concept, messaging queue is checking health of different servers, load balancing and heart beating..So, I am guessing it resides on an application server?? And then it talks to different server where the service has been hosted?Hey thank u so much I appreciate your work I have a query can u please help me out, I think u do have adequate amount of knowledge 😊I was disappointed to not see anyone appreciating the 9/11 crashing pun at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=4m36s">4:36</a> lolll@Gaurav:<br />Though content is good. I feel you are violating seperation of concern design principle by let load balancer deduping request from client. What we can have is FrontEnd service which takes care of these tasks and load balancer would hit one of the FrontEnd service.<br /><br /><br />Also zookeeper is the best choice for heartbeating and sharing some distributed info about a cluster of servers. I would recommend to use this.<br /><br /><br />What you say?<br /><br /><br />P.S. How could you forget kafka as message queue example :Pthis is the first time I found the wrong explanation.<br />1. Once you have notified and it found that server 3 is dead then it can give that specific task to &quot;assigner&quot; node which basically divides the task and share between other nearest server to that location (it is important). <br />2. Each shop has to maintain his own task queue and &quot;assigner node&quot; would add those task in that queue based on priority ( but this will be least among its own task, as it requires to completes own task first then other. ) <br />3. there is no use of centralized queue, until n unless you provide a feature to the pizza shop and based on user location pizza shop automatically (user did not select the shop which is always the case in dominoes at least)  assign this task to the nearest shop. <br />4. Load balancer (if you were talking about the actual load balancer between servers) is no use for the assignment, as its responsibility to just equally divides the task across multiple servers within the same region for which this load balancer responsible for.How S2 wont loose it buckets ????? Please can you elaborate Gaurav Sir  .....   In Consistent Hashing , some buckets from s2 is supposed to shift from s2 to s1 and same like s3 to s2 ..............   Sir please clarify my doubt I am in confusion !!!!!Hi Gaurav,<br />I have two questions regarding this:- <br />1)  How would the shop ask the client to pay, would you like to keep a WebSocket which is already evented or would you have some sort of polling, which again would take up the client resources?<br />2) What will happen in a scenario where a machine crashes, you redistribute its load and the machine comes back up again. Then there would be duplication for that request. How to handle that?Great video! One minor tweak I&#39;d make, rather than pushing tasks to the server why not have the servers pull tasks from the queue. No need for a load balancer and you can spin up new server instances without any bookkeeping or overhead.Is this similar to how RabbitMQ works?Why the heartbeat mechanism causes shuffling of all the incompleted orders?  It need to take account only that of the dead server&#39;s right?<br /><br />See only few gals are commenting out :DCool!<br />Thanks for sharing.Please confirm if my video understanding related to queues are correct :                                                                                                                        <br /><br /><br /> When S3 crashed, we wanted to re-distribute the order no 9 and 11 to other pizza stores (s0 to s2).But server did not have record or order no&#39;s which were assigned to Pizza store S3.<br /><br /><br />Initially we thought of using &#39;Load Balancer&#39; for this purpose. (This is clear to me, so moving to queue now)<br /><br />After that we improved our solution by using &#39;Message queues&#39;. If we use &#39;Message queues&#39; then we need to have one &#39;Queue&#39; for each Pizza Store (Both at client and server side applications). Each pizza store will listen to its own &#39;Message queue&#39;. Whenever a new Pizza is added to a &#39;Queue&#39; (belonging to S3). when this Message is received by Pizza store S3 and acknowledged and then S3 starts processing it. If S3 is &#39;SUCCESSFULLY&#39; able to complete it then message will be removed from the Queue at server side. <br /><br />If S3 crashes then heart beats are not received and all messages stored in the Queue [belonging to Store S3] will be added to other store&#39;s Queues.<br /><br />If S3 throws error/Exception (Enough Cheese not available for Pizza) during processing then message is still on server queue [Not a valid use case for current discussion]Most probable combinations of scenarios: <br />Async, Sync and in-flight from an architectural or design principles for any business applications or business applications with active messaging queues.<br /><br />Might be great to exchange and share more tgoughts to and on this sometime.what are different mechanisms to  assign Message Queue to different servers. is there any tutorial on this ?from where did you learn all this stuff? really great video :)As a European developer that has seen too much low-quality programming disasters from projects outsourced to low-wage Asian country developers, I must say that it&#39;s refreshing to see an Indian engineer that has actually studied for this stuff and knows what he&#39;s talking about, using the correct terminology... I&#39;m subscribing; you&#39;re creating great content.Thank you for your content!!!

Which part of the design could help us in achieving this?There is an wide popularity of Kafka as Messaging queue&#39;s , as i understand Kafka is not maintained (except confluent) ,so you need to take care of scaling /replication /availability/SLA-guarantees/Latency(cross geography presence) all sorts of things to manage on your own it on the other hand there is Google pub/sub which is an maintained solution and keep you away from all this maintenance and provides all features of an queue ... which one is better ?  <br /><br />Although couple of limitation of pub/sub is by default it does not maintain  order which if you actualy do want it it is possible using PUB-SUB/IO  , but also in general maintaining order for an high scale system an anti-pattern and would&#39;nt slow you down ?9 , 11 are being handled by S3 and it crashes 🙄🤣Super!!! Thank you Bro...Hi Gaurav,  I agree that it won&#39;t duplicate to same server(i.e &quot;request3&quot; won&#39;t go to &quot;s2&quot; again) but &quot;request 3&quot; can be gone to server &quot;s1&quot; right? How does &quot;s1&quot; know not to serve &quot;request3&quot; which is currently in process with &quot;s2&quot;.<br /><br />Will load balancer lookup for all the virtual hash functions off all servers whether this request is already there?Hey Gaurav, appreciate your awesome work. my point is as you gave example if a pizza shop is down. what i think there will be no server on shop side and a shop has a client id only<br /><br />servers must be at remote location.<br /><br />orders object must have a client id.<br /><br />there must be process on server side that check heartbeat of client with an associated client id. if that client id down ( clients spawn a heartbeat thread to server and server checks heartbeat from client) then it will do the rest of things your explained done by your notifier   component to assign the orders ( to client having nearest to client which is down)Gaurav, this is really a nice and knowledgeable tutorial you have made, in very sort time you have explained this topic very clearly. Can you try to make it as a practical ( how to implement RabbitMQ)at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=5m28s">5:28</a> he makes himself laugh and forces not to laughThank youWhen  s3 crashed, requests which were assigned to s3 (9 and 11) are redistributed to other servers( s0,s1,s2), but why there is need to redistribute the requests which were already served by (s0,s1,s2) in the first place -&gt; didn&#39;t get this point.<br />Going forward, let say they are also needed to  be redistributed, but doing that won&#39;t again send requests to the same server again.<br /><br />consistent hashing just assigns a particular range of &quot;hash key&quot; of requests to a server, and when one of the server dies , it just redistribute requests of dead server among other servers, it doesn&#39;t check whether the &quot;hash key&quot; of incoming requests is already being served by a server or not, it justs forward the request. Then how UNIQUENESS is achieved?Nice work. So on and so forth. 😂Please make one video on Kafka. Appreciate your work. &lt;3When is it overkill to use a MQ?Is Kafka a messaging queue similar to RabbitMQ? Or is it a completely different animal?what is the different between message queue and message broker?why order3 can&#39;t come to server s1 (@7.31)In a typical System design interview: Dabbe banao dabbe.. :Dwhen u say bucket, do you mean some sort of a set???Well..Well...9 and 11 are taken by S3 and S3 crashes.<br />He said it unconsciously, it proves that mind can relate things flawlessly without someone&#39;s knowledge.why use a notifier in period 15 second  instead of you can use a periodic checker on main queue that status is not done. I have a best idea in Software Architecture works  based on Store Procedure, I&#39;ll be happy Cooperation with you to expand my idea. my email: iranerpgroup@<a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail.com</a>Isn&#39;t Kafka a message queue?Why ar Venom xd9/11..and it crashesGaurav i am going to implement bulk email sending service. My use case is when a person purchase tickets for multiple persons then my service should send tickets to their corresponding email using any email service. I think messaging queues would be best in this use case.s2 is processing order no:3, how come it&#39;s possible to process order no:3 from s3,(how come it&#39;s possible  to pick single request by multiple servers)The only youtuber that keeps his video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=9m59s">9:59</a>I just wanted to know about the notification server. You said the notification server will query the server for order completion but won&#39;t the load be much lesser if the request from the server&#39;s end is sent instead of the notification server querrying repeatedly to each server. I may be mistaken or it may be some implementations specific stuff. 😀 Just want to understand.... Can it be also done like this.Hi, very nice video! I have a question, what about the Event Queue? Is it the same, something similar or something else?Gaurav,  the message queues would work for some offline processing.. Can u please throw some light on using the same for ecomm apps where customer interaction and response should be that of real timePlease suggest any good book for system design.Hi gaurav. please make videos on design and analysis of algorithms..<br />Things like how to determine the complexities of algorithms.. thanks for all your efforts.Hi Gaurav, All your videos was great and helpful for all of us who trying to get in to IT jobs. can you explain the messaging queue architecture design and post some videos in Technical architect interview preparation processGreat videoHey Gaurav, you explained the concepts behind services provided by a message/task queue neatly. Your system design series is extremely useful for beginners like me. Keep up the good work.<br />I have a small suggestion regarding the pizza example. In the scenario of a pizza shop node failure, the load balancer may consider other factors such as geographic proximity of a particular shop to the clients location. Hence the  dynamic reallocation of requests by load balancer also includes some business logic. This makes the example a little bit complex for explaining the purpose of message queue. Please do consider finding out more simple examples which serves the purpose without additional complexity in future videosGreat video. Would like a part 2So from what I know, a message queue is different from a load balancer.. How can a message queue has load balancing, heart beat, and notifier in it? that confuses meThanks a lot Gaurav for this video.😊👌👏👏 Suppose a server is doing some heavy  image processing task and it consuming lots of time and task queue declare it as dead server then how can we recover that processesing? Even if task queue directs that request to other server then same case is definitely going to be happened with that server as well. How to handle this problem?<br /><br />Regards.When notifier check that server 3 is down, and it ask for list of jobs not completed. right then why it cannot ask for jobs specifically related to that&#39;s sever from dB and fetch jobs related  to say server3 and allocate them to other servers. Will it will automatically resolve the duplication problem?Great job explaining everything in a way anyone can understand. You are a natural teacher! Please continue teaching and sharing your knowledge!Thanks, But duplocate handling has been taken care by all applications and it is mandatory almost decade back, that is the obvious in Computing technology. Anywat session was good.Hi Gaurav,  I have a little doubt in uniqueness with load balancing while say S3 server goes down and it has a order id 3. And also lets assume s2 has also an order of id 3. Now let&#39;s assume the request_id for both the order fall within the region which is to be routed to Server S2 when S3 is down. How will it handled then ? as we don&#39;t have the info in DB order_id 3 is associated with which server ? Please help . Thanksu r talking about distributed processingYou mentioned that server 3 is down, then why can&#39;t we just send the unfinished deliveries of server 3 to other servers, so there will be no duplication in the first place.Awesome video!!Concept wise, what would be a different between a Worker, a Consumer and a Producer? I am having some difficulties distinguishing between these conceptsHi Gaurav, nice video. Can we have the gateway consisting load balancers to distribute the requests to different servers and msg queue only to communicate between servers?Very niceHi Gaurav, Can you please explain this in more details like what are the classes hierarchy used to make such application ? Your teaching way is too good please explain this also. (Y)What if two messages in the message queue are dependent. <br />Say for eg I have a order management system.User pays for a product online and buys it .Now there will be two types of messages to be sent. <br /><br />Say one message is sent to user for payment information, <br />another message for  the seller saying order is placed. <br /><br />Now the payment msg should be sent to user first (on successfull payment) and then notification message to the seller. <br />Order should be preserved. What if the first message sent to user is failed, <br />we should avoid notification msg being sent to the seller.<br /><br />May be the example I have provided doesn&#39;t depict exact real time scenario, somewhat similar situation. <br />How to handle these kind of scenarios in message queues where sending one message depends on another message deliveryHi Gaurav, can you please tell me how this problem of asynchronous request processing was handled before message queues are invented?Bro, keep bringing up more videos like this. We are all such a big fan of yours. ALL the best! 👍 <br />PS: Amazon has SQS ;)Appreciate your work!! thanks for sharing.Hi Gaurav, This is the one of the best real life example (with pizza shop) showing the need of asynchronous request/response system. Thanks for the great video. Really loved it.Message queue is getting lots of spot light in the industry, please keep making the video on this topic i like you way of teaching. thanks again.Very well explained👍 ..If possible please make a video or two on Kafka Queues( involving Producer n Consumer ) ..This would serve as an example for for few of your previous videos on MQ,Load Balancing,Event Driven Systems..This would help them put together..HEY GAURAV<br /><br />Is messaging queues and task queues are the same things ?You use &quot;so on and so forth&quot; a lotSystem Design: What are Messaging Queues?<br />9,999 viewswhich mq is better?I am third year btech software engineering student and I am comfortable with normal coding....what should I do for better placementsWe would like to have videos on object-oriented design patterns too like observer pattern etc.<br />Please keep making videos. :DHey Gaurav, how expensive it is to distribute all the Orders of one shop to other shops? And Please clarify about the backlog issues in this mechanism. Thanks for the video!What if there is a change in order request by the customer. Does these messaging queues allow accessing any random data variable? if not than I think that we need to maintain another in memory hash map for the above request as it would be not adequate to query database as the wait time would be more.I&#39;m self taught and system design is not an area that I seem to be learning from documentation (and that makes sense, it isn&#39;t relevant to synatx or features of most technologies). Thank you for providing this material! You&#39;re decent to good at teaching, but mostly you&#39;re providing resources that are difficult to acquire outside a classroom or without a mentor.There are very less resource available for system design in youtube so please complete series . I like the way you teach. Thanks for making videos for us. God bless youNice explanation! Can you suggest resources to follow for system design?Hi Gaurav, great fan of your hard work. Can please suggest some resources for learning system design in depth.Consider 4 servers. server 3 which was processing request R3 and R33 gone down. (Service is about to complete) these requests now are assigned to other servers and they start processing it.   meanwhile server 3 comes online. Now at this moment other servers who got extra request s just started, and there work for those services is very less compared to the work done by S3. In this situation service assigned is reconfigure again??? Or work done by S3 is simply discarded???for each system design if a detailed explaination is there, then, it will be helpful for all becoz i think i can learn system designs from you <br />thank you for your extraordinary work

Just like every other president never does.Theres alot you can agree with Bernie about, theres alot you can agree with every candidate. BUT out of EVERY single one of them, Bernie is the only one you can trust. Why cant we try something different? We need change, big change, crucial fucking change.

Why? BECAUSE HES FULL OF SHIT.Wow, so many commies amongst Rogan fans. Sad. Taxation is theft, you bitch ass niggas.12,000 conservative Rogan fans are butthurt lmaoBen Stern? That voice... Haha. Seriously though, never been a big Bernie fan but this was a really good interview.I am an Indian and I can say that the US has a problem with India when the India government subsidizes critical healthcare components (like stents). This is the power of US medical companies.This guy is a communist and the rest of you do not deserve freedom as our forefathers proclaimed.  Shame on you Joe Rogan.  Your ignorance has no end, it&#39;s becoming incessant and intolerable.My boy Bernie! All you nay-sayers, give this man one of your ears 👂. Your network TV has been lying to you since the tube tv 📺 was a thing.Joe went too easy on Bernie. All Bernie revealed is we are a horrible country that has to fixed by REDISTRIBUTION. The fun topic of socialism was skipped. I&#39;m disappointed!Thank you Joe. We need more of this in this political climate.His clam Trump is &quot;Insane&quot; just took away a lot of good points and rational discussion. IDK. i was warming up to the guy. <br />Just saying Trump is not a Delusional or Insane guy so why even attempt to put it out there...... faggottry, oh wait I just remembered them silverbacks that cucked his rally.

Especially coming from Bernie. Go talk to Tulsi, Bernie!People that have 24/7 security, are always ready to surrender YOUR security.bernie a stoner!Everyone who managed to watch this interview should definitely watch Joe Rogan with Andrew Yang. Bernie and Andrew both fight for the same goals but in different perspectives and solutions. Watching both can open up different views and dialogues for the upcoming election!Look at most mass shootings what happens after the killing... Suicide. Look at the suicide rate in this country it’s ridiculous especially for males. A suicidal person is not rational and sometimes can get angry and maybe blame these feelings on society so to get back or to say fuck you he kills people then takes his life. If we wanna solve this problem we need to solve the suicide problem.Come on folks, what Benie says sounds great and I agree with a lot with his theories, you can’t can’t tax and increase minimum wage. This would kill small businesses.  Also, what about us that paid off our college loans recently. I would feel screwed. I paid mine off over 20 years. BS.people argue about where the moneys gonna come from but then seem to forget that the pentagon has no idea where 12 trillion dollars went lol. 12,000,000,000,000 ... lostI&#39;ve never been ashamed to say that I voted for Ross Perot in 1992 (same election where Bill Clinton was first elected). Ross was doing more to educate the public about serious issues (including NAFTA) than any other politician in that race. In truth,  I was hoping that Jerry Brown would have beaten Clinton for the nomination of the Democratic party. But Jerry was laughed at for saying that he had a website to learn about his campaign and contribute money. Now everyone does the same thing.. and they&#39;re taken seriously. I hope that people learn to take people like Bernie seriously because these are serious times.If you are watching this, you are the resistance.Joe: &quot;Do you get frustrated by the time constraints of the debates?&quot;<br />Bernie: &quot;Well..&quot;<br />Joe: &quot;That&#39;s all we have time for thanks everybody&quot; <b>turns off microphones</b>The same people put their entire faith and trust into the STATE are the same people who call Bernie a socialist. The irony is thick as fuck.fuckin commie bastardI have to say as a generally right wing person Bernie came off as much more intelligent here.

You&#39;re a good dude but I think Yang is what we need now.Well I&#39;m only going to pick one topic so I don&#39;t make a much longer comment then I already am, but when it comes to the minimum wage  argument how come people can&#39;t just meet in the middle? I mean why does it have to be 15? Why can&#39;t it be 10 or 12? Idk...Joe! Can we get Andrew, Tulsi and Bern together and just have them talk?Been waiting for this podcast for a long time! Thank you Joe for giving Bernie a good chance to explain his POV!Only 1 hour? I wish we could&#39;ve gotten at least 2 but I guess Bernie is an old man who needs his nap.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h03m21s">1:03:21</a><br /><b>Pay Attention</b>AgenderBernie, keep fighting the good fight!

Nah, Trump 2020What bullshit, this old man needs a nap he would ruin this country againRepublicans will still vote for the super rich Trump who doesnt care for anyone who aint the 1%..crazy how they bow to lobbyists.None of these politicians talk about Conscious Capitalism were you take profits and put back into your employees and growing the business to create more jobs! Tax incentives to small business is what drives this country. I am afraid small business gets clumped into the same category as the the greedy major corporations. Huge tax hikes would kill small business. With close to 30 million small business owners in the United States Why aren’t any of these politicians talking about this! 🤔wow joe knows nothing about guns or stats he bow hunts he didnt push back at allTrying to win swing voters with the UFO question 🤷🏽‍♂️💯🙌🏾 good play. Vote Bernie, and he’ll spill the beans on the greens 👽this fucking guy is a crook<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=6m00s">6:00</a> mins in and he’s already bending the truth.... smfh <br />TRUMP2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Damn Larry nice to see you on the podcast!!!America should have a virtual President created online - even created from an algorithm.  If the main President is not succeeding in one area then the Virtual President should be allowed to input some policy.Drug Test Washington DC..Drug Test Congress types!!  I Agree Sanders!!Go Bernie...the bestWtf is happeningY’all better vote this yearI would love to see Warren on hereethnic studies, gender ideologies, sociology, lesbian dance theory those types of credentials will not bring you money.,ZoooooooorThe ban wasn&#39;t undone by a Republican majority. The assault weapons ban had a sundown clause that stated if the ban showed no marked improvement in crime rates, it would be lifted. Guess what folks? Crime went up, not down. The ban was lifted. It&#39;s a bigger problem than just guns. Human beings are bent on killing each other.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=57m58s">57:58</a> - when you get a president who actually wants to fix things, you&#39;ll be surprised how much they&#39;ll get done. the last few have just coasted through their termsGood job joe. Kyle Kulinski, David Pakman, brother Cornel West, and now Bernie. Glad you are getting some progressive left voices on your show.I love how everything was politics then last question was about aliens. 🤣I stopped listening at &quot;assault weapunz&quot;420 MARINARA @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m00s">47:00</a>Why do so many of these comments seem like fake Yelp reviews? 🤔Where is the pot moment like Elon Musk?I just had my naturalization test to be an American citizen. This is so much informative for my first vote in this country potentially later on. That said, i am aware of the whole point of Bernie being here talking about issues in the US. But, whole time listening, it just sounds so bad and makes it sound like America has all kind of troubles.<br />From my perspective, America still is a land of opportunities and a great country.<br />Go America!Fuck guys we gotta make this man president the damm Media makes this man look too far leftMaking my heart bern <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>One last one for Joe! WTF . Bernie always said millionaires and billionaires need to pay there fair share. Now that he’s a millionaire. He only says billionaires need to pay there fair share. What’s up with that?I&#39;m a libertarian and don&#39;t really hate Trump. But after watching this it&#39;s hard to dislike Bernie. It&#39;s sad someone that actually gives a shit and wants to give the people their rights back is often mocked. <br /><br />Only in this country do people choose to give their rights up.In terms of shootings, Neil De Grass Tyson said it best In Terms of statistics. Use facts and logic not emotions to make decisions or formulate opinions in life. Thanks Neil!!!My timestamps were deleted...  I don&#39;t understand...  I come back and it&#39;s just sitting at 700 likes and then it just stops, and now I can only see it on the account it was made on?  The second highest comment with 400 likes at the time was also deleted.  I have no idea what&#39;s going on.  Anyone?Change the laws in the US so every candidate gets one free episode of JRE.This is a great interview because it gives people a chance to listen to Bernie Sanders talk about his views in long form. Downside is Joe doesn&#39;t push him on anything. Sanders&#39; views are that he has NO consistent ethical standards. He believes greed is bad if you&#39;re rich but good if you&#39;re poor (specific example the drug companies are greedy and that&#39;s bad but individuals who want college for free and healthcare for free, their greed is good. Bernie Sanders own greed is fine too - its perfectly fine for him to be in the 1% and do so with taxpayer money but its greedy for the walmart CEO to make $10 per year off every employee. He just lacks any moral character - his entire M.O. is to say something he wants and then point out a bunch of bad things. So he&#39;ll say like &quot;healthcare is a right&quot; and he will justify it without providing any reasonable sound argument based on logic reason and evidence. Instead its circular reasoning like &quot;this person in the past was for it&quot;, or &quot;wer&#39;e the only 1st world nation that doesn&#39;t have it&quot;.....uhm NEWSFLASH when England ended slavery for moral reasons - every single other country had slavery. By that same logic you could argue, &quot;England should have slavery cuz its the only country that doesn&#39;t&quot;. wtf sense does that make? Just dumb non-argument after dumb non-argument.Oh my God! This guy is AMAZING!!! I was so scared this guy was some kind of crazy person but WOW, oh my God, I cant believe how decent this man is. He is nothing like how I assumed he was, Im horrified at myself now. This is a good man and they railroaded him and malign him all over the place. How can anyone treat this man with anything but love and respect? Look at him, listen to his words; he bares no one any ill will at all. What a refreshing human being, I cannot believe we have had this man already in Washington and already listening to us. <br /><br /><br /><br />Yeah I am voting for this man. Jesus speaks through him and right to me. Lord, thank you!&quot;A president, who unlike Trump, believes in science.  And I do.&quot;  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h00m21s">1:00:21</a><br /><br /><b>Boom - Roasted</b>I love Bernie as a person, but this was bad. He just gave rehash of his usual talking points instead of proper policy solutions.&quot;Assault weapons&quot; are just semi-automatic rifles. Fully automatic weapons are highly regulated in US already. These assault weapons are as fast in killing people as pistols are, and pistols cause easily the majority of all gun deaths and gun violence in general.Thank you for having all the interesting candidates on the show.Sweet..  Let&#39;s make A person Like Bernie Sanders the First Test Case..  A psychology Report on Congress people..  A Wonderful Idea Congressman Sanders.. I agree!!!The gun rights bullet points Bernie touches on sounds pretty much the same as the rest of the Dems. He also seems fixated on rich people.Amazing quality of conversation. Beautiful exchange of mutual respect and concern for not only America, but for the world today. I will now take this example and try and implement it into my daily life through conversations and critical thinking. Fabulous work Joe, and thank you.Amazing.. Bernie 2020what a fucking idiot!  his ideas are messed up!!It&#39;s legal because they make the laws? Wrong. In the united states if it&#39;s not expressly illegal by a law. It&#39;s legal. Meaning you can do whatever you want unless there is a law saying you can&#39;t.  Bernie has a middle school understanding of everything he talks about. Big government bernie telling you how to live your life because he knows better than you do. What a fucking idiot.Here&#39;s how I&#39;m understanding the point on corporate taxes... <br /><br />* PROFIT = The amount STOLEN<br />* PROFIT = The amount we&#39;re truly worth (the full amount our labor produces) - (the amount corporations choose to compensate us)<br /><br />- Thousands of employees work everyday to make money. On the ground. Person-to-person. <br />- The billionaires/trillionaires take it all. Everyday. Every penny. <br />- Then they pay employees as little as they possibly can without breaking OUR laws. <br />- All that PROFIT we made them never finds it&#39;s way back to us. They HOARD all this money. They pay little taxes. Or they pay no taxes. <br />- So this PROFIT doesn&#39;t: maintain any of OUR roads, educate any of OUR kids, protect any of OUR land, clean any of OUR water, provide any of us with healthcare, NOTHING. The money WE MADE (for them?)<br />- We are the ones who got up and went to work, for hours, everyday, making daily sacrifices to work to provide for ourselves. Only to be robbed, left barely able to provide for ourselves, while providing them with even more repulsive, incomprehensible, self-flagellating amounts of money. <br />- Without us, they have no money. Having an idea to start a business in which other people do everything does not mean you deserve billions of dollars. It&#39;s pretty fucking entitled actually. Real and JUST compensation for starting a business should simply be control over it. What it does, who you hire, etc. That&#39;s it. Not 90% of all the wealth in this country. Compensate everyone (including yourselves) properly, my god. <br /><br />Am I understanding? (or projecting?) 😬SO refreshing to see Bernie tossing down knollege from the mountain to this particular audience, I like to think this fan base is forward thinking and rational. Happy Bernie is introduced to us without the media collusion as Alex was[Bernie] he lost me when he started talking about gunsI love how Joe wears a nice button down shirt when Elon Musk is on his show, but potential President of the Untied States gets a something you would wear hunting. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JoeRogan2020">#JoeRogan2020</a>Illinois recently legalized pot for recreational use. <br />Also expunging records for non violent (former) offenses.the epitome of kookI think Joe has his cause and effect backwards. I&#39;m pretty sure the fucking mental illnesses are the reason people are shooting, not the medication. Does Joe not believe in mental illnesses?Was having an externally rough day but, I took a nap to the sound of Bernie’s voice and it made it that much better... thanks Bernie 👍🏼 he’s got my voteI wonder if Joe is okay with paying 80% in taxes?When Bernie talks about billionaires and their wealth, he is really applying that he wishes he was a billionaire himself. I guess being a millionaire isn&#39;t good enough for him.BERNIE!  Candidates have an opportunity to express themselves in long-form.  It&#39;s called YOUTUBE!  This guy is such a geezerSo health care is a human right? So we&#39;ll have to force by jail/gunpoint to force people to go to medical school and treat everyone?Joe Rogan is about to get the next P.O.T.U.S. elected... This is reminiscent to how the highest office was won in the past! Research past presidents... I&#39;d start with James A. Garfield!Wonder why they didn&#39;t live stream this.Damn I just don&#39;t see how Bernie thinks that the government taking money for healthcare is any different than the drug/pharmaceutical companies. At least with the latter I get to choose how much I&#39;m giving<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang2020">#yanggang2020</a>Unless trump comes on jre I’m now voting for Bernie ..Let’s not forget that gun violence &amp; white supremacy must be addressed in the same sentence. I support Bernie but I feel like most candidates do not address this.If he&#39;s not talking about campaign finance reform, putting an end to bribery, and stopping corruption I&#39;m not interested in hearing any politician speak.Do u know that after heart surgery in the US your not in the hospital for a month??????? SURPRISE SURPRISE!The gun show loop hole is a lie. The laws do not change just because it&#39;s a gun show.My thoughts on...<br /><br />Housing- A home owner doesn&#39;t have to follow the market and charge large amounts for rent within their communities. There really is no excuse other than we are each  limited in our perception of the external world and want to feel safe and secure for ourselves and our families without thinking about the whole.<br /><br />Healthcare: Focus on preventative health care. Eliminate middle men by dealing directly with the source. Legalize drugs, but criminalize dangerous actions that hurt others. Lessen restrictions on Doctors and allow our rating systems to be the judge. Protect social security. <br />Do not feed what you do not want to live!<br /><br />Education: Yes, expand education or perhaps not be so wasteful with it and give a  person a chance at specializing in something before being released into society or award a one time pass that you can hold onto for a later time when they are ready. Also, children should be voting on things that make an impact on their school enviroment from grade school forward.<br /><br />Presidential election: The process should start by voting for somebody you personally know. If within your community that person  shines brightest and chooses to accept they have an inherent gift. They can move up by having long form conversations with other great people and be choosen amongst eachother until a point at which the public has to vote,  no electorates. All is paid for by volunteered money that offers equal opportunity to all the candidates.<br /><br />Guns: Leave it be for now. Instead, mentor a kid, participate in your community, be a leader, don&#39;t spoil your children. Again, allow children to vote early on! Empower them with responsibility and they will be much stronger and smarter than we are today. Always work towards lessening laws not adding to them. <br /><br /><br />Corporations.  As an individual you must have a moral code, Take control of impulsive buying habits, be thoughtful, Dont take more than you need. Question yourself and examine whether or not you are making a decision that is both good now and the future. Do not feed what you do not want to live.<br /><br />Anyway, that&#39;s just some of what i think.<br /> How about you?Unrelated but would love for you to do a piece on these guys...<br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/1694596914090256/posts/2402154773334463?s=698067283&amp;v=e&amp;sfns=xmwa">https://www.facebook.com/1694596914090256/posts/2402154773334463?s=698067283&amp;v=e&amp;sfns=xmwa</a>Bernie is a different, more honest man, once he is away from Hillary and her cronies. Maybe he no longer fear&#39;s being whacked like he did in 2016.Oh Christ.. he getting another house this time?Bernie&#39;s people should have had this scheduled for a 3 hour block.  1 hour is not enough for a JRE with a Presidential Candidate.It&#39;s really sick that a single person can gather so much money on the backs of employees and the environment we all ownDont know why i was expecting joe to spark a j in the first 5 min and bernie to just blow down😂😂Had watched the podcast with Cornel West a few hrs before and was thinking 🤔 man it would be nice if he could do Bernie Sanders. Log back to Youtube and there it is...wtf? 👍🏼👍🏼Hard pass!what if mental health is a societal issue and not a medical issueHadn’t heard him speak at length before. Impressed. May vote for him.

Kamala has ben exposed, simple as that.bernley sandals retardBernie 2020coulda been five hours long 👌What is wrong with this comment section???? I think Twitter took over with feel good   users and statements????People seem to love big conspiracies about aliens or chemtrails or psychedelics, but when the truth of the corrupting effect of big corporate money within their own society and politics hits them in the face they can&#39;t wrap their heads around it.Everything free? This guy is more leftist than even European socialist parties.Kentucky is a very poor state yet dont have poor people living in droves on corners.....

Even then your everyday items you purchase is a large percentage higher. <br />Im not opposed to helping others, im opposed to the government none of us trust controling anything ask the veterans how a socialist healthcare by our government runs. <br />Bernie wants your labor,your guns and your money. As a absolute constitutionalist fuck taxs,fuck socialism, fuck the left,fuck the right , fuck trump , fuck Bernie and fuck our entire political system. <br />Sincerely-your gun loving, hyper capitalist, constitution loving neighbor.Great interviewThe people want Bernie but the establishment will still cheat him and hand sleepy joe the election. Bernie has a pure heart and his words are true but politics is dirty and driven by falsehood. Super delegates was how he was scammed the last time now it’s going to be through electronic voting just watch.Finally!! Well done Joe!I have a lot of respect for Bernie but there currently is a tax on Wall St speculation. If your equity is held for less than one year then it is taxed at your regular income which - including brokers fees - can total nearly 40% of your returnJoe &quot;I took a bunch of money from Bernie (Bernie Sanders&#39; gullible brain dead supporters) to give a gaslighting (lying) commie (that can&#39;t do basic math) a softball interview.&quot; Rogan<br /><br />Bernie &quot;anyone that honesty supports me is a gullible, economically illiterate moron&quot; SandersOhhh please get Mitch McConnell on the podcast.this feels like a commercial...A Regular strength tylenol costs $55 on a hospital bill.  Think about that„Let’s see what’s up today.. hey is that Bernie Sanders..?“Joe wears a dress shirt when Elon Musk comes on. For Bernie sanders... this.This is the original Jack Dorsey video all over again. Way too soft with him. Didn&#39;t dispute his claims. Let him slide on way too many things that he said. May I suggest adding the right wing centrist version of Tim pool to the interview next time. <br /><br />What happened to grilling him about the $15 an hour wage increase. He wasn&#39;t even paying his own staff $15 an hour. People had to quit and they had discrepancies with him not paying them a living wage. What about the effects of the $15 an hour increase on smaller businesses. They would have to terminate some employees. Small businesses can&#39;t take the hit with the increased pay raise.<br /><br />About the gun issue. Firearm owners don&#39;t have an issue with assault rifle versus their individual names. It&#39;s the fact that they changed the definition of assault rifle. The rifles that are out there today or sporting rifles they fire semi-automatic. Assault rifles shoot fully automatic. That is a major difference. They intentionally called it assault rifle to put it in the classification with military rifles. Perception of the weapon is important. When people and vision a Arnold Schwarzenegger style of weapon from the predator. It plays in the minds and hearts of the people. The weapons are not assault rifles.<br />Now let&#39;s reference the assault weapons ban that was briefly discuss. It barely affected crime statistics when the ban was enacted. When the ban was lifted you still couldn&#39;t go out and buy a fully automatic weapon. Those items became an NFA item and they were harder to get. Also when the ban was lifted it&#39;s not like gun crimes dramatically shot through the roof. They still slowly declined per capita. If you were to ban assault rifles he claims that the FBI is not going to knock on their door. That&#39;s bullshit because the current Red Flag laws do have law enforcement officers knocking on people&#39;s doors and take away their guns without due process taking place first. Also let&#39;s not forget what happened to New Orleans during Katrina. Officers in the military went door-to-door taking people&#39;s weapons without their permission.<br /><br />He mention taxing Wall Street. But he does not say that he will be able to get that bill to pass. Are we going to make sure that the middle class doesn&#39;t get stuck with fitting the bill for the policies he wants to implement.<br /> Bernie bought up how he voted on Nafta. I would have expected for you to ask him why did he vote for the Clinton crime bill. That bill dramatically disproportionate put many minorities in jail for minor crimes. If he was willing to make such a terrible decision on a bill like that. How do we know that the decisions that he&#39;s trying to affect now are not going to end up the same way?<br />Wowantidepressants blunt empathy : <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2019/07/antidepressants-blunt-ability-feel-empathy/">https://www.madinamerica.com/2019/07/antidepressants-blunt-ability-feel-empathy/</a>Lost me @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m40s">35:40</a> that&#39;s my opinion period.A great manwut, just.... how do u get fukin Bernie on a podcastBro i just seen him in longbeach  comunity collegeBernie 2020And you say that companies are the bad guys for using money to INFLUENCE politicians?! How about we just do away with all you corrupt politicians that are being influenced by MONEY FROM “GREEDY” corporations. The reason businesses don’t pay taxes is because they are creating jobs that in turn pay huge amount of taxes. Go ahead and tax and regulate all your companies like Canada and watch them all leave. Paying taxes is a joke, the government is a joke. People like Bernie are preying on the uneducated. He likes to bring up how the big banks were bailed out by the government but never talks about how much they made off doing that. go look up how much money the government made off bailing out the banks, NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT IT!This is a slow pitch softball interview....didnt challenge him on anything....would have much rather see bernie on Shapiro...when bernie is challenged and forced to answer the tough questions his rhetoric falls apart....remember what happened when he debated Ted Cruz.....he got destroyed300k debt for a MD is nothing.  They can pay it easily over time and often only pay the minimum because they can grow their money faster than the interest.  Feel free to focus on feelings, but you have to know when you have gone too far.<br /><br />Joe knows there are no such thing as military style weapons.  He should have forced Bernie to  be more specific.LMFAO THIS GUY HAS THAT CLOWN ON HIS SHOWI’m fine with the government forgiving student loans but what about the millions of young people like me who decided to go to work so that we wouldn’t be in debt our whole lives? That degree already benefits them by making it easier for them to get higher paying jobs whereas people like me make less than 30k working full time. What do we get?You should hold a presidential debate on JRE, between the two most likely candidates.I backed Bernie until he shilled for Hillary. He had a lot of us fooled for a while 🤦<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>So almost a 20% dislike rate and not ONE negative comment in the ENTIRE feed.. guess there shadow banning comments now as well.. truth be, Bernie is a commie pig and his ideologies will only steer this country to the state of Venezuela in due time .the one thing I have heard from my Canadian friends is that it might be free, but you might have to wait years for it to happen and which it might be too late. And a lot of Canadians are not happy with healthcare.WOW THE MEDIA REALLY MADE THIS GUY OUT TO BE A SOCIALIST ELITE XD HOPE YALL UNDERSTAND THAT TRUMP WAS RIGHT, THE MEDIA IS NOT OUR FRIEND.This is epic! Legendary!! Thank you 🙏🏼  bring on Sadhguru, please!!!!I&#39;m concerned about his agenderNow Obama!If everyone fasted there’d be no need for free drugs and type 2 diabetes medsHard hittingWants to people have a child make it a criminal act not to report the pregnancy&quot;buy our Mararana!&quot; hahaOne point I agree with Bernie Santa. We got screwed by the China trade deal and NAFTA . Our own sold us out to enrich themselves. Both parties, the elite, there friends and families. They make millions we lose trillions.SADHoly SHIT!!Bernie knows!!!!!Once a soldier is hired make sure they’re hired for lifeThis is fucking crazy af. I know how don’t read these comments but this is so fucking crazy cool.Love that Joe is allowing candidates to have a good platform to discuss their viewpoints and positions. Now I know for a fact I will not support Bernie. Very nice and seems genuine but a lot his positions unfortunately don&#39;t add up and will cause more problems than they will solve. Tulsi seems like a better alternative.Fuck ALL political pigs.from far left to far right and everything in the middle.We ran away from communism in Eastern Europe. This guy was and is still a communist. He just changed label to be more votable for the typical sheep. Reading the comment section there&#39;s plenty of them. Just like in communism, they want sheeple to be equal, just not them.  Reminds me of Animal Farm. Some animals are more equal than others.BERNIE SHOULD&#39;VE BEEN PRESIDENT !<br />The world and especially the States would be sooo much better today, instead of all this bullshit going on every dayThis loser has been a public servant for his entire life but he&#39;s in the 1% and has multiple homes.  Bernie is a fraud selling shit to the retards of society.man.. i missed this.. oh well. at least its recordedJust wow !! This conversation was great. He might potentially just win my vote. You can see how genuine this man is. His ideology makes a lot of sense if we listen with a open mind.Why didn’t Joe ask why Bernie bent the knee to Hillary in 2016?Im shocked at the lack of Bernie haters here! Go Bernie!ThE wOrLd iS gOnNa sElF DeStRuCt iN 12 yEaRs. Citation needed. BaN aSsAuLT rIFLeS. They are banned. Bernie is old, out of touch &amp; refuses to pay his own campaign staff 15/hr. Wake up fellas, he&#39;s a scam artist.If you americans dont know history then its bound to repeat itself in america...Can anyone say the bolshevik revolution? <br /><br />Millions will die because of this communist bernie sanders. He can sound as nice as he wants but the whole eastern europe know what will happenOn a big election kampagne... I dont know if he makes it to 2020...    But as a european, it looks very weird and crazy whats going on with all your Presidents ! Bushs, Clintons, Nobama, Grump.... dont know but this guy talks now easy and sympathic and If he wins this shit, he will directly start the war with Iran! Mark my words! ;} <br />Clinton also wanted to start the war but now its Hillary aganst Hillary xD she will never do shit anymore. Dont know what she does in her Basement but i can tell you, it is 100% illegal!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pizzagate">#pizzagate</a><br />If USA isnt in war they would have to admit that they are bankrupt, same like 1933 in Germany.... <br />All a big fucking Show, we all cant do shit about it.  <br />Really Crazy times we live in! <br />He talks what people want to hear....and some believe this Shit ... 🙈 sry guys, i&#39;m just a &quot;stupid&quot; european. What do i know about your Problems &#39;;} ... <br />FF that...<br />Have a nice Day everyone !  <br />Carpe Diem 🗿👊His healthcare plan sounds promising but I&#39;m sorry the rest is garbage and contradictory.  The minimum wage amount based on a number he pulled from thin air that isn&#39;t market based isn&#39;t going to do anything but cause inflation through businesses raising prices of food, cutting hours or best case raising minimum wage workers taxes by putting them in a different tax bracket.  There is no finally making it under any liberal because once you do you&#39;re the bad guy and it&#39;s on to the next under dog.  Bernie isn&#39;t unique in his politics of being a democratic socialist, the labels democrat and socialist are interchangeable at this point.  And when he cites California as having a higher cost of living that&#39;s exactly why, look who runs it and how it votes.  And you can talk greed all day but the fact is everyone here needs rich people because poor people need jobs and their instant gratification lifestyle that mega companies provide through their service and their not going to stay in a country that has consistently stayed in the top 5 highest corporate taxed countries in the world when they can make a bigger profit in China.  He is right about one thing, you cant explain your position in 45 seconds and it&#39;s useless anyways, this country is officially divided beyond repair and you&#39;re either objective or idealistic on how the world works.I don&#39;t agree with Sanders but I respect him for doing this podcast. God, I wish politicians would cut the shit and act normal like this. Rogan, get Ron Paul on here. I know he&#39;s not running but he&#39;s like Sanders just MUCH better ideas.Democracy and socialism aren&#39;t mentioned in the constitution. Bernie, you&#39;re a piece of Shit FUCK YOU!I have had inaccurately 12  16oz beers tonight alone because ofDespair I was with a girl who is rich wealthy with a kid together she get rid of my kid and I’ll never be able to top that Just like a man in the military top of his career and then just get sent home what is he do he drinks and became suicidal because he has never experienced anything better and he doesn’t think he ever willJoe checkn your mass shooting data we are 62nd globally since 1966.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m00s">1:07:00</a> The answer Bernie gave to this last question may have actually won him my vote.This old Fart never had a job till HIS 40&#39;s..  look it up folks.. Then he sold out to Cannibal Hillary Jeffrey Epstein in 2016 and around the years..  What A WeirdoI wish it was longer<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />is what my girlfriend keeps telling me.<br /><br />Also I wish this podcast was lengthier.all talk, no proposalsFeel the buuurrrnnn!Thank you! Great one Joe! Let&#39;s get Rick Doblin back thoughI managed to abstain from jacking off to pay attention to this entire thing.Decided to watch this and listen to what Bernie has to say even though what I’ve hear from his last campaign to present I’m not interested in his talking point because the only way to pay for everything he wants is to tax the people upwards of 90% so the people get screwed while him and his friend become the top elite even more than they are now. Democratic socialism or just plain socialism doesn’t work. The issue he talked about need to be handled but not the way he wants... Bernie isn’t the answer.Is this Bernie dropping out of the race? If he is even going to be near the nomination, this will be used as a hit piece. &quot;Bernie Sanders on AltRight podcast&quot;Kudos for getting a politician on the show that isn&#39;t Andrew Yang. You have to play softball and you agree with a lot of his positions, but damn, softball isn&#39;t your game. Disappointing.This guy&#39;s a moronGet Elizabeth Warren on!FYI Bernie you already arent allowed to LEGALLY own a firearm if you&#39;ve been found guilty of Domestic Assault LOL, i love how the low IQ liberal left soak this shit up like he&#39;s even saying anything.........ok joe, now have Larry David come in and memorize every word and roll it back.Do people that paid off their student loans get reimbursed what they paid before this student loan payoff plan goes into effect? If not, why not?See the problem isn&#39;t neccesarily health care it&#39;s the price of health services. Like Bernie said he got insulin for 1/10th the price up in Canada. If it didn&#39;t cost $2k just to walk into an emergency room we wouldn&#39;t be having a lot of the problems that we are in my opinionJoe bring in trump next!!!Thank you Joe for providing one of the few legitimate media sources for in depth interviews of presidential candidates. From the couch with Redban, Duncan, and Joey, to being a leader of talk shows on a global scale. Powerful Joe Rogan!can you imagine Bernie face to face with Putin?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m33s">1:04:33</a>  Bernie made a gaff, and meant Japan, but his point still stands.I might just share this on Facebook.My PCP and Neurologist couldn&#39;t figure out why I got seizures.  I told them I was smoking marijuana day and night for 13 years, they ignored it.  I quit weed, stopped getting seizures and feel great.  Now they give me pointless appointments for lab tests continuosly to milk me dry and still ignore the fact that I fixed my own problem and they never figured out what to do other than prescribing drugs I refused to take.  Fuck unethical doctors.Well done Joe! Sanders 2020!Bernie couldn&#39;t even do 2 hours low energy.<br /><br />Surprised black girls didn&#39;t bully him again6 mins after the podcast <br /><br />Elk burgers and a blunt dipped in diamond sauce , covered in kief dipped in liquid DMTAlways feel bad when joe brings on a controversial figure and gets hate, hell I don’t agree with Bernie on politics but sometimes listening and being in a conversation is the best thing you can doI fucking hate the power of money......All of you should be hitting that thumbs up. This should be trending.YASS JOE THANK UAnd this is why I voted for him in 2016, couldn&#39;t believe Hillary won the Democratic vote, but I&#39;m glad he&#39;s still around and trying again.Absolutely disagree with most of Bernie&#39;s policy positions but enormous respect for appearing on Joe&#39;s podcast, even if it&#39;s only for an hour.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=19m55s">19:55</a> that is a lie. I used to work at sonic and only 5 employees who were all managers or the general manager were over the age of 21. All the rest were between 16 and 21. I guarantee that most fast food restaurants are the same way.F*cking communism! Only spews out the &#39;benefits&#39; but none of the hardships needed to achieve his utopia. Life has never been, or will never be easy. Stop trying to breed generations of cant-do simpletons who more and more look to the &quot;man&quot; for help and handouts. Sort yourself out. Get a job. Save. Dont do drugs. I dont want your free shit. Responsibility equals freedom. Take yours for yourself.What&#39;s scarier. 40 year old Walmart employees aren&#39;t getting paid $15 or the fact there are 40 year old Walmart employees?Lol, what&#39;s up with this random important guests in JreBernie Sanders ASMRIf there are more native americans in prison than caucasians I&#39;ll eat my phone.👏👏👏👏👏rogan with a power move right away with the microphone. every podcast that wants to show who is in charge fucks with the mic or tells the guest to &quot;eat the mic&quot;This guy will not be President.<br />He talks about dividing wealth as a pose to making it.He is not a winner.America loves winner&#39;s.<br />Im not saying its right.Joe needs to ask the real questions about guns. How would an assault weapon ban stop people from becoming proficient with 12-15 round pistols, &quot;quickscopers&quot; with highly modified abolt deer rifles. Weather it&#39;s five people or 100 it&#39;s all just as bad. Deal with the real issues at hand. Media blasting it for days. Crazy people, criminals will get guns. Phillipines makes fake 1911s all the time and ship them. Just execute the perpetrator on the spot. Old school justice to hanus crimes. Tighter security (armed coherent vets) which creates jobs at Mass gathering places. Just bottom line don&#39;t make them famous and put your trained unemployed vets to work. As with me, and fellow vets would be more than happy to protect anywhere on the planet.It’s crazy how Joe Rogan’s podcast carries as much or even more weight than TV nowadays😮 wholeeee shit!!!! He got an 600 year old man that masterbates to Stalin speeches and hates capitalism even though he sold a book that made him a millionaire dammmmm..... and no Keanue Reeves.......SAD but seriously joe get Keanue on plzzz🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾Bernie is a fucken moronFinallyBernie seems drunk i had to edit this.When he doesn&#39;t have to scream like a banshee he actually is only mildly out of whackHow are those 3 houses Bernie?Bernie! Socialism 2020!Y’all are really buying this 😂😂RIDICULOUS! Heart surgery in Canada does not cost $0.00. Canadian health care workers don’t work for free. Bernie is the king of deception.Let Joe Rogan interview all candidates calmly and then people decide from there! Definitely better than &quot;debates&quot;.As a fairly conservative person I’m not a Bernie supporter but it is great that he came on the podcast.  I don’t agree with him on some core things still.. but after hearing him on this forum I wouldn’t think it’s the end of the world to have him as president. I think for some of his core beliefs that he’s passionate about.. this nation could really benefit from going forwardHow good would a Tulsi/Bernie ticket be  for 2020 ???A free education for college is a joke being that half the people in college should not even be there.Three comments from myself , as someone from the uk , touching on things that Bernie said.<br /><br />1) Party political broadcasts are typically 15-30 minutes long, and this is as Bernie said, free air time for political leaders. Often these are timed to start when the evening news would normally start... but these are normally on the BBC channels. BBC is the ‘national broadcaster’ and we pay a license fee of approx £12/$18 per month for this ... there is no commercial advertising as a result.<br /><br />2) On solar/renewables, households need to be able to get subsidies to pay for solar on their roof plus a battery system ... charge through the day, use what you’ve generated at night ... this alleviates pressure on the electricity grid, which was not designed for large amounts of PV generation nor for mass charging of electric cars.<br />In Germany , solar PV + battery installation for home owners is subsidised 110%.... <br /><br />3) On Healthcare, the UK NHS is in financial trouble . We take this for granted somewhat, as it’s existed since 1957. I had a reminder of how expensive US healthcare is when I went to the emergency room in Virginia, about 20 years ago, and it was $200 to talk to a nurse... I walked out.<br /><br />Lots of good policies, but the billionaires will fight to keep Bernie out. I believe his policies would be good for America.This is a hella smart move by Bernie. JRE is for sure the best way to reach the masses these days.You know for a fact they smoked a fat ass blunt right before, but due to Elon Musk’s backlash they didn’t show it.Remember when Al Gore said in 10 years there will be unbelievable damage done.In order for us to be reasonable, we have to stop and listen to both sides.  Joe, will you have more candidates on your show?Hope Bernie, Tulsi or Yang win otherwise Trump is 4th best option.I feel joe did not correct some of what Bernie said. Sad but good podcast anyway.Crooks on Wall Street but Bernie sold out his Supporter in 2016 to Hillary Support?..  Weird..  Does not make any Sense?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h06m22s">1:06:22</a> Yes Bernie, climate change is real but the scientists you are putting your faith in are not always telling the whole story. The Sun&#39;s climate is also changing and the influence the Sun has on our weather is massive. The papers on this subject come out daily. Unfortunately many climate scientists do not factor this in. Just search for space weather to get an idea.So Bernie thinks we fought China in WW2?Bernie &quot;Posture&quot; SandersJoe taking sides now and he&#39;s siding with a literal Soviet Communist.......JRE has elevated to a new level! We are talking Barbara Walters/Larry King of oldBernie is exactly what the United States needs.  He has the potential to actually make America great again.I agree, seconds to answer a question is BS. Especially when the world needs to hear more...I can understand the gargoyles on the table.  But the Egyptian sarcophagus is just creepy.Why wasn’t this conversation longer ?Feel the bern!!I really don’t agree with Bernie on much... or anything at all. But it was nice to have him on and let him talk. It’s nice to have a discussion over this stuff. Other people may be bickering in the comment section but I am enjoying this.Bernie is too real. We need him now more than ever.Bernie is a moronOmg huge respect to bernie for doing this i am totaly gonna vote for him just because of it omg<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m17s">5:17</a><br />The U.S DOES provide healthcare.  He&#39;s lying. <br />A hospital CAN&#39;T turn anyone away.  LEGALLY.  They must treat a person regardless of insurance.I’m feelin the Bern..  thank you Joe for making this happen, and thanks Bernie for your time and having the balls to come on a podcast and take questions like this..he’s got my voteIF this whole democracy thing is legit, WE NEED THIS MAN IN OFFICE!!!!DAMNNN JOE ROGAN IS ACTUALLY THE BEST !!!!!! ITS CRAZY HOW THIS PODCAST CAN GO FROM PEOPLE LIKE ACTION BRONSON TO JOEY DIAZ TO FUCKING BERNIE SANDERS !!!If you raise minimum wage prices will go up that’s all , he avoided that factF@@k Bernie...  so we should cancels 330 k in student loan debt  for a freakin Dr/surgan who will make millions in their life time instead of using that money for the homeless or other  blue collar worker who are also in debit ... College grads make  more than 1 million more than non college working class ppl over their lifetime....  it&#39;s welfare for the most privileged of society.. only 25% of americans go to college.. why should they get  tax money  from the 75% of poorer americans.... so short sighted like a lot of his crapHERES A FUCKING IDEA<br /><br />USE THAT 2 TRILLION/YEAR TO PAY OFF THE NATIONAL DEPT FOR 10 YEARS <br /><br /><br />THEN WE WILL HAVE EARNED THE FREE SHITBernie have you ever done DMT?Great podcast. props to Bernie for a long-form interview. Only aspect i appreciate about him.<br />Socialism is a novel idea, and is in fact fairy tale. Never been instituted correctly, and frankly never will... always ends with gross government overreach and oppressing the people to stay in line; added in with the constant attack on the 2nd amendment, and i can&#39;t disagree with this vision of our country any more. No thank you BernieMany things I like about Bernie and many I don’t, but I’m glad to see a longer conversation taking place.  I hope Joe will have on more politicians that are willing to have long, real conversations.Never socialism....Pay for ur own healthcare pplHow can ANYONE hate Bernie after this? The guy has so much class he won&#39;t even speak about how the DNC screwed him. <br />Some crazy Libertarians are gonna hate, but Libertarian HAS NEVER WORKED, EVER, ANYWHERE. <br />Democratic Socialism is working in dozens of countries CURRENTLY.Bernie is cool I guess but Andrew Yang is the most eligible candidate right now. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>I often give Rogan a lot of shit, but him giving Bernie a platform is a stand-up move. Bernie has been blacklisted from mainstream media, and demonized by the liberal and conservative news networks. This is his only real gateway for having a genuine conversation with working class people. These are issues we should all care about, left or right.JOE IM STILL A VIRGIN ROGAN.Great interview.  I don&#39;t necessarily agree with all of Bernie&#39;s positions, but I appreciate how he genuinely cares about his ideas and his stances on policies.  Authenticity is a very, very rare trait in politicians unfortunately.Liar...I am Canadian.This is liesI don&#39;t think Bernie is a bad guy. He seems genuinely concerned about these things, but he&#39;s so misguided. His stance on guns and school shootings especially. He&#39;s talking about school going to have to start doing drills... I&#39;ve been doing drills since middle school (2004 and 2005) called &quot;shelter in place.&quot; I had to do this throughout high school; this isn&#39;t a new thing. We own more guns than people because they&#39;re objects. I haven&#39;t done any actual research to back this claim, but I have no doubt that in the U.S., we have more smartphones than people too. This isn&#39;t some massive issue and he even admits it himself when he&#39;s says: &quot;99.9% of gun owners wouldn&#39;t do that. (talking about murdering people).&quot;<br /><br /><br />Counties also don&#39;t negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies.free healthcare doesn&#39;t work, I understand it sounds good on paper, but it really is a bad idea.Hahahahahahahaha literally didn&#39;t have a serious real answer to one question joe turned into such a socialist soy boy I&#39;m dead.............Eat a dick old cracka.cannabis legalization talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m00s">47:00</a>Kick this un american man out of the countryNope, vote Republican. I want corporations to make trillions off me. I like my student loan debt and not being able to get a job in my fieldthat cost me thousands of dollars. I like not being able to pay my hospital bills and not being able to afford my medication. Keep assault rifles legal! I like showing off for my friends. I don&#39;t care that one percent of gun owners commit mass genocide because I want my guns to protect my family from something that will never happen. I want to hunt deer with a machine gun and not use the meat for anything. Nobody cares about teachers and education, most kids learn off of YouTube. F those impoverished people and areas, shouldn&#39;t have been colored! America was the greatest when we killed all the Indians and enslaved black people. MURICA!!!He&#39;s right about healthcare.Interesting interview Bernie still has my vote. I had kidney stones racked up a bill of ten thousand, I remember the phone call was an lady. She asked me how I was going to pay for this I told her I couldn&#39;t. I had no health insurance or a job at the time, her response was well Mr Pahl it will go on your credit report. <br />I was able to pay for the small stuff but the rest of it dropped off my credit report after years of not answering collectors and having a hard time trying to even get a studio apartment, a vehicle was lucky to have a friend sell me a junker for $100.This commie fuck looks down the entire time he is spewing his bullshit...if you&#39;re confident in your ideas you don&#39;t cower like a bitch.Joe &quot;let&#39;s pull this thing&quot; RoganSo weird to see Bernie talk so softly.&quot;buy our marinara&quot; lolJoe should&#39;ve showed some kicks. Now that shit would get hella views.😂Bernie &quot;Also Ran&quot; SandersY&#39;all better listen up and listen good, that man sitting there is our last chanceJamie deleting the fuck out of comments LMAOLeave the most important question at the end... Got my voteWhy is Bernie whispering? This podcast is the cure for insomnia.A 30 year old shouldn&#39;t be making $13 an hour..What was that 30 year old doing all his/her life that they would be making that wage at that age??🤔🤔Crooked law system. No way to change it.I like what Bernie has to say about reining in the drug companies and legalizing pot. <br />He loses me almost everywhere else.<br /><br />Joe Rogan, just by asking simple straightforward questions, established himself tonight as one of the premier jouranlists in the country. Funny isn&#39;t it, without even trying, Joe is better at interviewing people than all the so-called professionals.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h01m34s">1:01:34</a> joe said “your crazy and your hour is up”Get trump on the show!how are you pay for that?<br />i tell you how, and then he starts to bringing financial gap but never explains how he is going to pay for all freebies.The healthcare  issue is huge. I had cancer and beat it, but the cost literally bankrupted me. I am young and dint have much of a savings. This issue needs to be fixed.Honestly I was pleasantly surprised by Bernie. And good on you, Joe, for having him on and giving him a platform.<br /><br />Are you going to invite Trump or  Trey Gowdy on, though?<br /><br /> And the one other thing that I still can&#39;t get over is that even if the military is the only one who is legally sold these firearms (assault weapons), can anybody actually tell me with the utmost conviction that there isn&#39;t going to be some back door deal where incredibly rich &quot;bad guys&quot; get their hands on them? <br /><br />No. Not if they&#39;re honest.Joe does love his aliens....   :)A candidate can post a video on YouTube FOR FREE!! <br />Bernie is making up excuses.  I don&#39;t even have &quot;television&quot;. Netflix and the internet.  That&#39;s it.  <br />I have a feeling I&#39;m not alone.Thank you for having Bernie on. Now i know not to vote for him.I&#39;m voting for Bernie.  I wanna know the truth about aliens.Bernie does not like to make eye contact with joe.  He is always looking down explaining his point.  Joe forgot to ask Bernie why he was laying his people off cause he couldnt afford 15 per hour, since he is a millionaire.. he could pay it right?  He does have a few good ideas though.   How about we cut the pay of professors and college tuition will come down too.  If we dont their salary will just keep increasing cause its all free remember.....Thank you sir, we&#39;ve done an hour and I know you have very important things to do... Just one more question, have you tried DMT?Bernie 2020 🇺🇸“And you certainly don’t do it by tweeting every other day” 😂💪🏽 shots fired.i feel like joe should use his popularity to set up a podcast with every candidate. gives enough time for each person to talk about their policies; interrupted. including the most supposed controversial ones. the ability for someone to share what they think, without any irrelevant questions, can help people carefully make a decision before they vote.Had to thumbs down this one, Bernie is a fuckin joke.Haven&#39;t read a comment yet but I guarantee there&#39;s gonna be a bunch of triggered right wingers. Can&#39;t wait lmaoHey, if you&#39;re feeling the Bern, please show your support by donating to the campaign or signing up to volunteer. 😊 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotMeUs">#NotMeUs</a> <br /><br /><a href="http://berniesanders.com/">BernieSanders.com</a>From Australia - To USA Citizens. Please do us all a favour and vote this bloke in as president.OH shiiiBERNIE/TULSI 2020  &amp; Warren secretary of state &amp; Yang treasury secretary. <br />Seriously, Bernie has always been for the people, and he fights for us all!does he answer the only question thay matters... how does he plan to pay for his fantasy ideas...His solutions for the drug and poverty problems would take GENERATIONS to implement and see change from. They are good ideas but take too long to accomplish in the maximum of 8 years max as president. There needs to be fast solution AND a generational solution.This is exactly why Joe is so popular. He probably doesn’t vote for Bernie, but this is a polite and interesting conversation none the less. Well done Joe in keeping an open mind always!Bernie &quot;sexy for the media&quot; SandersHoly fuck he did it, well done JoePro worker!  LOL!!!!!  He&#39;s never held a job in his life.  He&#39;s never produced anything or provided a service to anyone that anyone ever purchased....and he wants to run our economy!  There are not enough billionaires on the planet who can pay for everything this commie wants.Heart surgery and your bill is zero? So how do doctors get paid? Should I pay for someone else that doesn&#39;t take care of their body as well as I do?It&#39;s so weird hearing him not shoutingIs Joe going to light one up with Bernie?45 seconds ? Mate you&#39;ve had 20 years to explain.Bring Ron PaulHe was doing alright until he came up into the guns topic. “I am not saying that would solve the issue but we have to do the best we can.” So we should sacrifice a constitutional right for something that does not work? <br /><br />“Mental health is healthcare” I agree with that line and his take on drugs and studying their effects on kids. Overall, very impressed with Bernie now that he has time to explain what he is about.Please invite Marianne Williamson to the Joe Rogan Experience!Bernie....either Trump is a too stupid to understand or he&#39;s lying to us.  Well said.Great segment...unfortunately,  many people won&#39;t take the time to really listen...they&#39;ve made up their minds about Bernie from the sound bites and propaganda, etc....nobody really wants change, I guess...must be ok with everything the way it is:/Bring on Thanos, I mean TrumpThis guy is amazing he needs to be president.Trump 2020Lmaooo @ Joe low key wanting Bernie to smoke of his weed lol respect ✊🏽 😂😂Bernie &quot;white people should hate themselves&quot; Sanders vs Joe &quot;my dude, have you tried DMT&quot; Rogan.<br /><br /><br />ZZZzzzzZZZZZzzzzRestaurants need to pay up 15 dollars quit having customers have to supply labor tip tax much of tips depending   how much eye candy worker isIs he still coaching Syracuse Basketball?105 years ago, ordinary men didn&#39;t have the right to vote. That only came in after men died en masse in the trenches of WWI - prior to that it was landowners which included, tadah! Women.Toe &quot;Oh you don&#39;t like drugs?&quot; BoganThe US &#39;officially&#39; has more prisoners than China, but China has millions of people in concentration camps which it states are merely schools that re-educate, and therefore the prisoners are really students.This just cements my vote for Bernie. So awesome that you brought him on to speak more in depth, Joe! Great interview!Some of Bernie’s ideas are valid, however big government IS NOT for America... government needs to stay out of our lives as much as possible. Any kind of socialism is NOT good. Now living in the states, I came from Europe where all these leftist candidates think will do magic... unfortunately it comes with a price, hefty price on taxes since money has to be generated from somewhere..... paying 30,40,50 even more on taxes is RIDICULOUS, and these are ok middle class to lower class income people, god forbid you make over 100K in Europe you’ll pretty much pay 50-60% on taxes... long story short, Healthcare needs to<br />Be fixed, sure, free school free blah blah blah will NOT work in the USA.. just no way. Sorry Bernie you’re fighting an already lost battle. Matter of fact, non of the democratic candidates  has a chance to beat Trump in 2020, I don’t see it happening. He’s got way too many weapons to attack you guys now...Good job Joe. Love listening to your podcasts.JOE BIDEN NEXT.. .AND DONALD TRUMP PLEASEThe real issue in America thats being ignored is the fact that 10 years ago, Brian Ortega had a choice...Fucking commiesI think he&#39;s just plain wrong on most of the economics. But he isn&#39;t evil. Thanks for having him on, Joe. We need this more often.Climate change explained for Right wingers; <br />Regardless of your belief in the merits of anthropogenic climate change, THE GLOBAL MARKET BELIEVES, &amp; IS TAKING ACTION. If AMERICA is not a LEADER/PRODUCER in this INDUSTRY we will be left out, only CONSUMERS. It was AMERICAS first @ the table INNOVATION + our MANUFACTURING capabilities that has propelled us HISTORICALLY to be the #1 economy (whether it was the Model T, or the Iphone) We can not afford to treat the TECH of climate change as a garage project hobby- GOVT $ NEEDS TO BACK BUDDING COMPANIES EXCELLING IN SOLAR, WIND, BATTERY, ETC LIKE IT DID THE APOLLO MISSION- Because China is about to take our long held #1 in economy spot, &amp; THEY SURE AS HELL ARE SUBSIDIZING GREEN TECH MASSIVELY. <br /><br />Just have to speak their Deutsch-U get away from fossil fuel the same way we got away   from coalThis has been the best medium I&#39;ve ever seen to get the detailed &amp; comprehensive opinions of a candidate I&#39;ve ever seen. Thank you Bernie and thank you Joe!Take a look at this. This is a real interview. No censorship, no scripted bullshit, and no walls set up in place to avoid touching on scary and real topics like this. Props to Joe Rogan and Bernie.Joe Rogan: How can that happen?<br /><br /><br />Bernie Sanders (Who is an actual lawmaker:)  BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS!!!!People dont believe in climate change, but religion is also not proven by science?The extra money we pay helps other countries be able to afford it while the company gets ita money back from what they put into making the drug and price goes down over time generally.I didn’t realize how diversified joe Rogans fans areI&#39;m feeling the bern againDamn, that&#39;s a lot of dislikes. <br />I like Sanders, I think he really wants to change the country to the better, but I just disagree too heavily on some of his points.<br /><br /><br />Raising the minimum wage to $15 is going to absolutely murder small businesses. What if I want to open up a local tutoring business? I would have to charge much more to pay my workers&#39; salaries and that would result in less people going to said business. In that sense, I&#39;d love for it to be negative income tax or universal basic income tax instead of that big jump. If anything, it&#39;s just going to accelerate companies into full blown automation and displace even more jobs. <br />Free college for all is very suspicious. I would never say it had to be entirely free, but it should definitely be cheaper for sure. Giving everyone a free degree won&#39;t do shit unless it&#39;s a STEM or business related degree. Canceling student debt wouldn&#39;t be so bad though. <br />On climate change. NO NO NO. STOP SPREADING THE WIND AND SOLAR BULLSHIT. I love solar on households with energy storage but it should never be the main power source for a grid. It is still way too inefficient, it&#39;s not a working source 24 hours per day, making these panels leave huge emission footprints, and they don&#39;t even recycle those toxic materials when they&#39;re made. Wind is also a fucking joke. Please, please consider going nuclear. The evidence and stats are out there, it is by far the cleanest source of power that we can deploy TODAY that could save the planet. They have killed way less than every single power source out there and the biggest disasters are extremely exaggerated. We even have molten salt reactors that could be tried in conjunction that are far more efficient, less prone to meltdown(not even a thing on most designs), and don&#39;t produce nuclear weapons.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=55m11s">55:11</a> Joe asks why isn&#39;t making America great trying to make the worst off communities better?<br />Unfortunately, because when one says &quot;making America great&quot;, many people don&#39;t believe that the disadvantaged communities in America are part of America.Bernie a FREAK 😝💦💦💦Bernie &quot;BUY OUR MAURARA&quot; SandersEverything’s free <br />And no one has to pay for anything with cashGreat interview joe. Nice job boys.....good times tyThis was wonderful.This dude should really set up a meeting with Andrew YangI love hearing Bernie in this format.  When he has the time to explain himself, he is so calm and lucid.I think it would make better sense and better progress to somewhat combine the issues of education and wages by focusing on making training for skilled positions much more accessible and desirable. Get Bernie in the same room as Mike Rowe. The problem isn&#39;t as much that these entry level positions do not pay a living wage as it is that these positions are filled with people that are not entry level employees, but do not have the skills to get better positions or the means to relocate to somewhere that needs someone in a better position. Bernie even alludes to this fact, but misses the point when he does. Bernie is old school in his heart, and I will always love the guy for that, but he has to get away from the identity politics and get back to being himself. Old school politics were like this conversation and the comment I am making. We all want to get to the same general area but we disagree on how to get there and what obstacles are the most important to face first. We had different strategies but were running the same race. Now it seems like nobody even knows where the other side wants to end up, and frankly the concept of &quot;the other side&quot; being a real thing is part of it too. Anyway back to the topic at hand. Raising the minimum wage is just the wrong angle of attack for this problem.  The gap between earnings and cost of living is definitely the issue killing us, but raising the minimum wage just moves the starting gate and everything else adjusts to suit so thata the ratio is the same in the end just filled with higher numbers. We need to look at the problem in a fuller and more honest way and take in all of the factors or else we are just pushing the problem down the road and buying a few months to a year or two of feeling better before we are hit with it all over again. It is like dealing with the budget. Ya if you raise the debt limit you get to spend a little more for a short time but you just end up hitting that new limit and eventually you have to overhaul spending instead of just bumping the limit for a temporary relief. Raising the minimum wage is just a temporary relief as well. Hopefully my ramblings make sense to someone. Bernie means well and he is truly someone that has faught his entire life for other people. God love him for that. In this he is just wrong or at least misguided.Such a shame, he is so smart and committed to solve such big problems but he’s a sellout who has submitted the far left. He’s pro open borders now and anti-2a. Not to mention extremely pro abortion. I can’t support him, but this showed me he’s a good guy.What if the JRE hosted a long form debate?Every  candidate should be on Joe Rogan. <br /> <br /> We never get a chance to really know how they think.<br /> <br /> It was funny to see Bernie saying how the drug issue was a very deep question, but for once there is time to get right into it.<br /> <br /> Like him or not, props for going on the show.Here’s Bernie’s plan: Give me all the guns, give me control of your kids , your jobs , your cars , your healthcare, your lands and then I will decide what you and yours will do. FOREVERMORE. You will be fine as long as you do what I say. UTOPIA for me that is.I really hope  Bernie Sanders can do what he says. FUCK THE POWERI still prefer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AndrewYang">#AndrewYang</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>This is one of the few JRE episodes where I guarantee there’s nothing of value I can learn from the guest.Fuck the haters! I’m all in with my man Bernie!<br />Should’ve been his nomination in 2016.Eternally grateful to Joe for hosting Uncle Bernie.This guy&#39;s a fraud, endorses Clinton after he&#39;s robbed.  Then when asked on Fox this year if he&#39;d contribute his proposed tax rate that he wants us common people to pay he scoffs at the notion.  Do what I say, not what I do.  Ya fooled me in 2016 Bernie, not a chance in hell again.Lol isn’t Bernie a part of this 1%.<br />Isn’t it something like $400kJOE ! why did you not correct him on his assault rifle nonsense?????? we all know assault rifles are machine guns by definition and to my knowledge NOT ONE MASS SHOOTING WAS DONE WITH AN F#$%^^ ASSAULT RIFLE !! lol look I voted for Bernie when he ran and I&#39;ll probably vote for Bernie again but I find it hard to get behind somebody who declares war on something that he is obviously little uneducated about I mean for God&#39;s sakes he probably thinks AR-15 stands for assault rifle 15 :pBernie doesn&#39;t pay his own staff $15 an hour. Also, you&#39;re not getting my guns. Ever.The drug companies still make their billions even with free healthcare. The government just pays the bill and then you pay tax....Great job Joe. This showed the best side of Bernie. His ideas are still completely pie on the sky and will crash our economy and ruin everyone&#39;s retirements but he presented himself nicely so there are lots of nice comments.Saw this as I was about to go to sleep... guess I’m staying up another hour thanks JoeUnfortunately everything about improving everyone’s life by legalizing drugs and offering a more stress free life we’ve seen, in the boomers and early gen x. Putting the pins to major corporations that don’t pay taxes and legalizing some drugs are good ideas. And gun control does need reform, but limiting “assault weapons” will be negligible to the death count. In fact, gun deaths are down compared to 20 years ago.Joe Rogan and Bernie Sanders, i love this.He calls China authoritarian but in the same sentence says we have more people in prison!Come on Jamie look some of this upThe debates are disaster and don&#39;t work. <br />Bernie: we need long format multiple hrs of debate/ for each candidate to explain himself on TV like other countries for free<br />Joe Rogan: yeah but TV networks would never aloud that plus commercials its better if candidate use the internet like you and i are doing right now.<br />Bernie: no no no it can be done we just need legislature to make it happen.<br />I&#39;m like WTF is he for real its the whole main problem with Bernie Sanders hes too attach to old paradigms and standards unlike Andrew Yang who understands the usage of new forms of mediums and technology to benefit us.Bernie wears glasses...trump doesn&#39;t need glasses he already has 20/20...go away bernie...your a phonyROGAN 2020Bernie Tulsi then AOC in that order Thats the planJOE IT IS LEGAL BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS! That&#39;s the nub of the issue.Suuuper stoked to watch this one!15$ an hour minimum wage does only bad. Companies will raise cost to equalize profit. So the people who were making 7 who make 15 now are still making minimum wage, but everyone who was making more than that gets hurt by the cost increases. So what bernie Sanders is either to stupid to realize or actually is trying to achieve is crippling the country into dependency on the government and the welfare state.It&#39;s just an idea but, were facing a climate crisis and the need for renewable and environmentally friendly sources of energy and technology will soon require more factories and labs for development. Why not encourage these companies to create jobs in those communities with the greatest need?I would have voted for Bernie Sanders over Trump.... With that being sad THANK GOD that he did not get the nomination. I honestly believe he could have won because in that time there was many people that believed this BS (As did I). When the DNC did him the way they did and rigged everything for HRC i could not believe he layed down and let it happen... I switched to an independent after that fiasco. I also opened my eyes and seen it for what it was. Both sides have their corruption but i can honestly say that i may not like Trump but he has done alot of what he said he would. The democratic party destroyed themselves in 2016  and noone is to blame but them.This was great!!! I’d love to see this format of discussion from all of the candidates. Maybe like a week long thing about a month before the election???? <b>Wink</b> <b>Wink</b>That was fast hour lol30 minutes is not enough, an hour is not enough. The time question is irrelevant. My sister-in-law had both of her lungs replaced. For other folks, the surgery costs $800K. My mother-in-law just broke her hip. She&#39;s scheduled for hip replacement. For other folks, the surgery costs about $40K. For both surgeries, the out-of-pocket is essentially &quot;free&quot;. How? Stay tuned.Imagine if he gets Trump to come. It will break the internet.I&#39;m from England don&#39;t no nothing bout Bernie but he sound like a realist and a good leader. Hope he lives up to expectationsThe answer is Andrew Yang. Wake up people. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang2020">#YangGang2020</a>Bernie for PRESIDENT !Opposing views please weigh in:<br />I have two counter-arguments for universal heathcare I cant personally dispute. 1) If we look at the population of the United States we can all agree there is a huge diversity in everything from beliefs to habits to where we live etc. If all Americans from all 50 states all pay the same into the system, the person who loses if the one who is healthier, makes choices to eat right, exercise, avoids stressors and so on. The person who wins pays the same amount into the system, but is plagued by health complications because they smoke, eat poorly, never exercise, and make choices that generally carry negative health outcomes. They need more medicine, surgeries, more visits to doctors and specialists etc. How do you justify to the healthy person that the system is fair? Universal healthcare may work in smaller countries with a more homogeneous population, but our strength in diversity is a huge hurdle in implementing universal healthcare.  2) If a person does wish to spend more on a personal healthcare concern, why should they not have the right to spend what they want to? The medical field is dramatically diverse, and some people have higher priorities concerning things like dental health, psychology, and dermatology. How could people ever agree on what should be provided for by universal healthcare if we are supposed to pay equally?YOUNG JAIME I LOVE YOUBernie won me over.Decent interview, but if this isn&#39;t a promotional video then I don&#39;t know what is🙄👎He didn’t say anything meaningful.Joe, there are so many things you should have pushed back on. Paying for all these things is impossible.some things he wants to do make sense but they&#39;ll never let him win the nomination. <br />As for guns... it isn&#39;t a gun issue! It&#39;s a cultural, mental health, parenting, over medicated &amp; masculinity issue. You&#39;ll never stop tragedies or criminals... but if we focused on our culture and promoted families instead of degeneracy then we would solve a lot of it!<br /><br />2A isn&#39;t going anywhere. The way white Americans are currently being treated &amp; our nation&#39;s are being invaded. Only white nations though... you now want to take their guns.... do I have to spell out what will happen? Guns aren&#39;t going anywhere &amp; &quot;Assault Weapons&quot; aren&#39;t a thing. You can assault someone with a butter knife. Leftists are so sad....<br /><br />I really hope you ask Mr Sanders about Israel, dual citizens in our Gov,  Immigration invasion of America &amp; if we should also ask Israel to take these &quot;migrants.&quot; Such a joke...<br /><br />Deus Vult <br />🇺🇸⚔️☠️⚔️🇺🇸I see bernie took a couple notes from Andrew yang. Also the drug crisis in America can be fixed by the freedom dividendIf he bans assault weapons the sale of 80 percent lower sales will skyrocket like in California and we will have ghost guns uncounted and unregistered. The world would be safer without guns, but that’s not an option so guns it is, and handguns are behind 95% of gun crimes so that’s the reality.TRUMP2020!!!!! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸this particular webpage is suspiciously laggingGet rid of financial aid and student loans and price of higher education drops.If Bernie Sanders wins the Presidency, I believe this appearance will be a Seminole moment for his campaign. Hopefully people listen to himAll the questions answered, even the &quot;if you find out about aliens, will you let us know?&quot; one! LOL AWESOMEEdit: when Bernie says we pay for it, how do you think the government pays for it? When he says &quot;we&quot; he means YOU. The government choses how to spend your money, your taxes on everyone of your paychecks, because they think they know better than the citizen and we know power doesn&#39;t cause corruption. <br />Thanks Bernie for explaining to us why your policies won&#39;t work. This helped me a lot!<br />I&#39;m disappointed in the lack of preparation to counter his minimum wage rhetoric with his own situation with his employees. Also some of the claims he makes about Canadian Healthcare being as good if not better than ours in quality is just stupid and no one believes that. Things like this that even someone who doesn&#39;t follow politics should be able to say wait what&#39;s going on. Luckily I am not too concerned as he is making average people understand his policies MORE and it makes them MORE scared to vote for Bernie.I actually understand why bernie was screwed out of the 2016 nomination now. Unless you get big money out of politics nothing will ever changeBernie sanders is a career politician ...so he can use campaign funds to pay for all his living expenses....he lives on campaign funds and banks his book money and salary...he pays employees shit money...8 more years he will be in a nursing home...I don’t think socialism would help America, see what is happening in Sweden and Scandinavia... but huge respect to Bernie for attending an interview!Bernie only on here shilling only after last time he realized that the little people’s media actually matters, and only for an hour... gtfoSANDERS 2020Bernie got here what he wanted. No real pressure on him.FUCK YEAH!  My favorite person in the world other than my wife!  About damn time!YANG2020  :)It&#39;s shocking that he still doesn&#39;t seem to buy the argument about automation, @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=20m00s">20:00</a> - &quot;significant number of people working at McDonald&#39;s aren&#39;t children yadda yadda livable wage&quot; Look - Finland has a high standard of living and you know what? McDonald&#39;s is deploying robot cashies en masse and over time it&#39;s likely even the kitchen staff will be replaced. Is that what you really want? I don&#39;t understand why living on unemployment is better than working a &quot;real job.&quot;<br />&quot;The burden is spread,  everyone has to raise wages&quot; Yes - the companies that automate will destroy the competition. See: New York car washes after they got their minimum wage through.Sanders just won.Shit just as shit as the tuslie gabard one just pinched off quicker. A whole hour to get indepth on the issues and all he manages to say is billionaires are bad. I&#39;ll give medicaid for all get rid of your student debt and softly says I won&#39;t take away your guns maybe. Wow I&#39;m so grateful you&#39;ll consider not taking away more of my rights. Can we get a real fucking presidential candidate? Fucking Trump vs Bernie is trash. I want my fucking rights back, deregulation on nuclear energy and decreased wars. Is that so fucking hard to get?I’m an independent who tries hard to rationally absorb all of this information from both political points of view. Great interview Joe with the limited hour you had hitting on the key points. It was good to hear Bernie articulate his views within this type of one on one setting.  I think we as viewers really get to understand some of the issues better outside of the typical “chaotic” mainstream network television debates. Well done.The Maharishi Effect: if 1% of the population engages in meditation, violent crime in the area goes down considerably.  There is a need in this country for drugs, guns, all sorts of accoutrement of the ‘freest country on Earth’ that we are programmed with.  Despair is a result of feeling cut off from others, and dependency on ‘legal’ substances like alcohol and cigarettes to ‘sell’ this paradigm only further reinforces this division, cuts off people from each other and keeps them angry or depressed.  Mitigating despair means giving people the ability to listen to their true self: people don’t have trust for their government and thus have less trust for themselves and loved ones.  Trust is the true economy.Healthcare isn’t a rightHe&#39;s running for president? <br />Hilarious.Trump 20/20Yo 3 eyes👁🧠 check out my mixtape on my fb thanks!<br /><a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=141509570313233&amp;id=100033625733271">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=141509570313233&amp;id=100033625733271</a>Bernie is gonna make pharmaceutical meds cheaper. Which means more people whom suffer from mental health will be able to afford medication. Which means more people will have psychotic effects from the drugs. Which means more people will commit mass murders with the guns that they buy from the illegal aliens that he allows to smuggle across the boarder. Oh shit. I’m voting Trump.I’m picturing Bernie going on your moms house and watching TikToks“These are not radical ideas.” As a working class person I can say that in my experience everyone agrees with these ideas. It’s only the wealthy and the out of touch who don’t want health care reform or a living wage.I think a better alternative can be found at the republican healthcare website <a href="http://justdieyousickpos.gov/">justdieyousickpos.gov</a>His point on the UK doesn&#39;t ring true to me as an English person I can&#39;t remember any politician speaking uninterrupted for half an hour straight. <br /> It does seem odd to me the way that the health system works in the US as an outsider looking in. <br />It doesn&#39;t make sense to me making an enemy of the medical companies as a strategy.<br />The 12 years before the end of the world climate change theory seems pretty ridiculous.<br />Perhaps the minimum wage rise should be age restricted to over 21&#39;s that seems sensible.<br />lower tuition fees and a higher bar to get in to university would probably stop snow flakes getting into college.<br />Banning guns would probably lead people to stab each other like they do in London, but having open debates about issues like immigration might help.<br />Personal responsibility doesn&#39;t seem to come up much, everything seems to be is somebody else&#39;s fault.Just a reminder that the average of all polls for the primaries for the last election, Bernie was polled as easily beating Trump, whereas Hillary was polled to only come head to head against Trump if she ran.  Yet for some reason Bernie &#39;chose&#39; to step aside for her.I liked Bernie for 2016 and I would vote for him if tulsi loses, but the fact that he stood behind Hillary Clinton to help her beat trump after the democratic party fucked him made me lose all respect for the man. The lesser evil argument can justify anything, and Bernie folded after 30 years of standing up for the people. Tulsi 2020Socialism is for dumb people and psycopaths that controls dumb people, period.Pharma buying dislikes on this video tooWill he pay off everyone’s mortgage and car payments too??I don&#39;t see the point in having a habitual liar on a show that&#39;s traditionally about laying things out honestly.<br /><br />Bernie&#39;s entire economic plan is based on disproven sociological pseudoscience from the turn of the last century, and his ideas on class and race are as outdated as his hair.<br /><br />This man is not only behind the times, but constantly claiming everyone else is wrong. He&#39;s a useless politician who lost and sold out to what basically amounts to satan, and he&#39;s a hopeless old-guard socialist desperate for relevance.<br /><br />Oh, and for Bernie himself - healthcare can&#39;t be a human right because it is a service, not an item or activity to be granted access to. Enormous numbers of people dedicate their lives to solving the smallest problems in health, and Bernie is proposing either stealing their labour or increasing taxation to unsustainable levels to fund any and all research and treatment regardless of merit or effectiveness. This system not only doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s been proven not to work many times over the past 100 years.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AndrewYang2020">#AndrewYang2020</a> Has real answers and solutions!!!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=16m15s">16:15</a> Joe asks him what he will do specifically when he becomes president and he talks just like he does on a campaign. Bernie is past his prime and sold out.As of 10PM, 11,000 people dont want politicians to have a open forum to talk about their policies. If youre R or D if you agree or not, it doesnt matter, why the hell WOULDN&#39;T you want open discourse like this to know what their positions are? R &amp; D, we are under attack America. Shit is fucking with us on both sides and we need to start asking what the fuck is manipulating us. We need open discourse like this for ALL SIDES at ALL TIMES. and if someone tries to take that from us, we need to shut them the fuck down. This is not a partisan issue, this is a American issue. This is a human rights issue.Only 14.8 percent of mass shootings are committed by people with confirmed mental illness diagnoses.This podcast may have won Bernie the election ...<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23havehope">#havehope</a>One thing I struggle with is the comment of &quot;the majority of the Americans&quot; that keeps getting re-hashed on both sides. You have an essentially divided populace 50/50 politically.  Where is the majority?   There may be a majority in ones party, but that doesn&#39;t translate to a majority across the nation. <br /><br />That aside, thank you for bringing on the candidates out of a &quot;debate&quot; setting. Please keep doing this as 2020 marches closer.You have my vote. Fuck you, and lick my balls  if you disagree.Healthcare isn&#39;t a human right, it requires the expertise and labour of others. What, are you going to force medical professionals to treat people against their will because they&#39;re denying the &quot;human rights&quot; of someone else? That&#39;s called slavery.<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyc-restaurants-cut-staff-hours-to-cope-with-minimum-wage-hike-hitting-15/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyc-restaurants-cut-staff-hours-to-cope-with-minimum-wage-hike-hitting-15/</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://laborunionreport.com/2019/07/21/watch-sanders-campaign-responds-to-15-hour-criticism-by-cutting-hours/">https://laborunionreport.com/2019/07/21/watch-sanders-campaign-responds-to-15-hour-criticism-by-cutting-hours/</a>PODCAST WITH DONALD TRUMP, SHIT WOULD BE EPICThese comments look fake. It appears as though his staffers are posting comments and upvoting each other.The guy is great, do I want him as a president..... HmmmI can&#39;t wait to see Bernie get dominated by fat black women again like last election.He has no answer to the distressed rural communities. Only Yang with the Universal Basic income can mitigate the distress in these communities, who lost their jobs to automation - not just China taking the jobs, it was automation that took their jobs. Yang 2020Joe: &quot;Hey so I have this idea...how about we get all the world leaders to do DMT. I think this will solve all our problems!&quot;You said Canada has free healthcare.. look at there population. I want to be on his side but U.S.A has a way bigger population then any country with free health care or free school tuitionDid I  really have time for this much stupid??  No.<br /><br /> Did I tune in anyway?  Fuck Yes.Another reason healthcare rates increase is because Americans get  waaaaaaaaay more fat and unhealthy each year. Gotta keep getting those worthless degrees so your pays guys up and you can buy more dumb useless shit. Then have rich Bernie talk about how it&#39;s wrong being rich. 🤣🤣🤣👎👎👎Like to get Joe Rogan to be a Moderater at the debatesJust about to listen to this. I&#39;ve always thought Bernie was an imbecile with big ideas and little understanding of how to implement them or the consequence of these ideas. Happy to be proven wrong though, and props to him for coming on.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m32s">1:04:32</a> Talking about a new industrial revolution to lead the planet in saving the planet like the time after we dropped two nukes on Japan. Except this time is a &quot;green&quot; industrial revolution.What if the electronics are heating the atmosphere?Bring yang back!He should offer to smoke a bowl with Bernie like Alex Jones.😎Oh I&#39;m socially liberal but I&#39;m economically conservative is what most of these comments are. You all are moronsI had a blood clot that could have killed me. Got prescribed eliquis. Its 500 dollars a month without insurance. Wish me luck. America, yay.This is probably the one Joe Rogan that&#39;s gonna make me the angriest. It&#39;s his interview with the twitter google and youtube peeps all over again. Softballs. Please pitch your wack ideas here because I am scared of your power15 $ minimum wage will just reduce the hours people work while increasing the cost of service.I Choose the USA constitution over socialism don’t fall for it young people it never works look at Valenzuela it took almost 40 years for socialism to kick in, it all starts with promises like like burnie is talking about.My mother overdosed on heroine 🦸‍♀️ I love Bernie for sharing this!25 minutes in and this bird hasn&#39;t presented a single actual solution. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yang2020">#yang2020</a>I think 99% of Bernie Bros would fit into the Yang Gang just fineexcellent interview &lt;3  Thank youOh shitThis Communist pos can roast in hell.The Bernster points to correct issues but doesn’t offer a single tangible solutionBernie is smart AND has his heart in the right place.<br />BERNIE SANDERS FOR PRESIDENT 2020I wish they would have given Bernie more publicity for last election , I appreciate him making time to come on Joe&#39;s podcast because I really don&#39;t own a TVGood interview but I can&#39;t stand Bernie🤮🤮👎👎👎👎Listen to Bernie Sanders..  He talks in Resonating tone under A440..  Ask any professional and they will tell you that this is pretty weird.  Especially coming from a world leader.Great interview. I still dont believe in climate change though!Shocking that a lyin politician could go an hour in a discussion. Most podcasts are 2-3 hours.Should&#39;ve given Bernie more than an hour. Great podcast 👍i hope trump comes on  with joe  i will bet he does before the its done 2020Oh no joe rogans poor right wing fans are crying rnKeeping on saying that healthcare is a right doesn&#39;t make it any more true.Rand Paul better get his ass on JRE and clean this mess upInsurance agencies are the end of existence. FUCK this institution.I think Bernie means well, but he is not hitting the nail on the head on too many issues. Andrew Yang has real solutions to all these problems. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yang2020">#yang2020</a>This is something for the history books.Yang gang onlyPutin reference towards the end. Increase Russian email addresses, level 10!Bernie is the only candidate to put this country on check and point it in the right direction. We cannot let Biden lead this country in the same direction it’s already goingI would feel alot more comfortable with student debt being wiped out but only if they complete the education that they are being funded.  Should not be able to drop out or switch courses without consequence.  Should also keep people realistic about the type of education they hope to achieve with there relevant education and skill level.spineless bitchThank you Joe Rogan and Senator Sanders.<br />Iowa, conservative leaning (pro 2A, pro life, pro immigration reform) Independent, Christian, farm family man here.<br />I voted for Trump in 2016 because the Clintons are criminals and the rest of the democrats just wanted to play identity politics.<br />That being said, if Bernie is an option in the 2020 general election, I am prepared to give him my vote.<br />I don’t care what any son of a bitch has to say about it.Hey America? You listing? Can you do the rest of the planet a favor and Vote this guy in please?Great interview but I hope he still loses, Trump2020Why can&#39;t we just have Joe host a presidential debate? Fuck CNN, FOX, fuck all of them. Give all the candidates enough time to talk.Slash the goddamned military budget at least in half for starters! Then end the private federal reserve&#39;s stranglehold on currency creation!Good convo, but this guy is a clown. Socialisms never the answerPresidential candidate on the podcast.... you know how big this is?Each election cycle hoe should host all the candidates. No bias, no bullshit and no agendas. <br />Jre podcast could certainly overtake the mainstream media as the most informative, important outlet for presidential candidates.Who thinks Trump will come on?I’m voting against socialism. Sorry I’m not feeling the Bern.His parents didn’t pay a nickel for his education? Holy damn my tax bill here in NJ it said like 70% of my property tax went to the schools - that ain’t free buddyThe people have more rifles than the US military? Good.Disagree with the man wildly, but can&#39;t say I believe he&#39;s a bad man. Glad to watch something like this.Joe you didn’t ask Bernie how long it takes to get a doctors appointment for that heart surgery. The reason the medical bill is $0 because the person is dead before they ever see a surgeon.Interview Donald Trump?!! I would love to see that could you make it happen?Thank you Senator Sanders and Joe Rogan.  If you have not watched JRE with Cornel West don&#39;t miss it. It&#39;s great.Bernie&#39;s lack of eye contact with Joe is troubling, my dad always said never trust a man that won&#39;t look you in the eyesReally wish Bernie would go deeper into the numbers. I feel like he is only hitting the surface. Example: Joe asks why is it legal for companies to sink so much money into politics, Bernie answers with greed, power, and corruption. I don&#39;t know the full history but these things just seem too simplistic a response. I&#39;m used to Joe&#39;s interviewees going deep into specifics, quoting facts, studies, history. I was expecting something similar here and was disappointed at the simple answer.<br /><br />I also don&#39;t like Bernie&#39;s response to fix America&#39;s problems, legislate away all loop holes. It&#39;s not the only means to a solution. It&#39;s a huge uphill battle that will take very long to pass. The amount of time it takes to pass on amendment to overturn citizens United could exhaust the electorate out of action. Why not entertain the idea of creating new legislation that would outweigh the effects of citizens United? It would certainly pass faster and capitalize on the active electorate&#39;s momentum better than a drawn out amendment would. Give the ppl a yearly $100 tax credit to donate to the their candidate of choice, use or lose. This can drown out the effects of citizens United  and be put in effect much sooner.Get Noam Chomsky on here!!!Surely the minimum wage should be paid by HUGE companies, where as casual work for say a mom and pop shop shouldn’t be forced at $15 an hour. Bernie clearly doesn’t run any form of small business.We just need Joe to do one of these for each candidate, including the president, from an unbiased standpoint. Joe Rogan is one of the best non-partisan interviewers around. Screw the debates! Lets have all of them on here. then weigh your options then let&#39;s make a choice. I&#39;m not a Bernie fan, but I sincerely  enjoyed this episode and I fell much more informed about his platform after viewing it. I feel he has the best intentions for the country as he views it but I tend to disagree on many of his points.I love this country and we need a platform like this to continue  to move forward together and united in my opinion. Fuck the divisive ass media! Joe for Debate Moderator 2019!!Get us soph fuck this old comradNuclear Energy, simple as that. No Carbon emissions &amp; the tech now days is extremely safe, less deaths per 1000 workers than solar.Let’s not forget the important question here guys.<br />Has Bernie done DMT?Nice job Joe.Best show ever👏🏽well equal to Cornell West👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽We have a Zoloft problem. Not a gun problem.Very insightful interview. Definitely has guts for speaking on JRE. Bernie is right; not one person can solve all these problems. It takes millions. Love him or hate him this episode was eye opening.MAKE AMERICA SMART AGAINI was actually tryn to hear him out til he started talkin about weapons bans....then I snap back into reality.World War II was with Japan in the East not ChinaBernie Sanders, Larry David, and Bob Lazar walk into a bar...We could actually have a third party candidate required to debate in the final debates.. ? Sounds like a good idea. If Americans weren&#39;t so scared of a candidate winning with only 40% of the vote, maybe we could actually have a libertarian party.The importance of this episode...I consider myself a constitutional libertarian.  Let people be people as long as they&#39;re not harming others or taking their things.  Bernie makes good points, I&#39;ll admit.  They&#39;re needs to be a change in the political order.  I respectfully disagree with the gun statement.  The second amendment proves we need more armed citizens during these shootings.Fuck you Joe. You’re a dipshit. Look at me. I can’t function without pot. Talk about your tin foil hat show. You just don’t know, bro. Yes, I do and fuck you.I am suppppppper excited to watch thisThank you Joe for using your platform for goodIncreased minimum wage only hurts small businesses and entrepreneurs. Large corporations can easily afford it or automation while increasing minimum will weed out their competition. Ubi is more flexible and would solve many problemsCanada has free healthcare because most of our doctors are not worth paying forFederal Labor complaint against his campaign. Cutting his staffs hours after giving them $15/hr. How do you not ask those questions.Absolute SHIT interview!<br />Joe did ask some great questions...BUT he then allowed Bernie to babble on, spewing complete bull shit, unchecked! No follow up to challenge, what simply was , grossly incorrect. IE: Bernie claimed the assault weapons ban of &#39;94 was over turned by a Republican majority...WRONG! The law was written with a 10 year expiration in the damn thing.  After ten years, it died, as it was written. <br />Also, DEFINE ASSAULT WEAPON..&quot;&#39;As you know, are military weapons of mass destruction&quot;....&quot;We have to ban assault weapons&quot;. &quot;There over 400,000,000 assault weapons in America. More guns than people&quot; Be clear...what the hell are you calling an assault weapon??<br />More and more commie bullshit!!<br />On And on it went.<br />Absolute SHIT interview!!<br />Kudos to Bernie, though, for coming into this forum to state, more clearly, with out interruption, his positions. Now there should be NO DOUBT from any of the listeners:<br />Bernie is a COMMUNIST !Is he going to talk about how he got fucked by the DNC and Hillary last time?I&#39;m with Bernie on tackling the gun stuff. Obviously, there isn&#39;t a &#39;easy&#39; solution. But as an Australian, we have had gun control take place in the late &#39;90s from the Port Arthur Mass Shooting. That&#39;s what it took Australia to control gun violence. One Major Shooting. The hard thing I think is American&#39;s saying it&#39;s our second amendment to have rights to have firearms. That amendment is bloody 200 years old. I truly feel for American school kids or any American really that lives in a country with so many shootings, in what seems like a daily occurrence. It seems like a nightmare of a problem over there and I hope something can happen to stop these terrible shootings. Mental Health also isn&#39;t the only thing to blame. Mental Health is an epidemic worldwide. But yes, America should follow in Australia&#39;s steps in having a medicare program to help those with Mental Health Issues and other medical issues.WTF. I thought Obama care was the end all beat all healthcare system ever made!!!!I&#39;d never vote for Bernie in a million years and I don&#39;t agree with him on pretty much anything BUT I really respect him for using a podcast as a way to publicize his campaign, especially JRE, where lots of people tune inThe only way someone can commit a mass shooting is if they have mental illnesses? Come on, Joe, that is such black and white thinking.Fucking piece of shit communist.  Toe Rogan is a paid government shill.Joe &quot;quit buying that schwag weed, Bernie&quot; RoganAnswers were still shit bernbest presidential candidate we&#39;ve had in 40+ years. the dnc better not fuck it up like 2016. waited for this one for a while now. he&#39;s gonna unrig the system if they don&#39;t get him first.first order of business is get the money out of politics. until then nothing will changeIf Toe Rogan had a pair he&#39;d get Father Donald on. But perhaps he&#39;s not as open minded as he preaches..... Keep America Great 2020.This guy dreams of being GOD. Legislation to make media companies give free airtime. This guy deeply believes that the State is supreme and government above all else. Mainstream thief.That&#39;s a lot of dislikes. <br /><br />Robots 🤖?Joe Rogan and Elon Musk for King of EarthHow could any rational person not like what this man has to say?? He&#39;s not perfect, but neither are any of us. He is well versed on the topics, talks about them in a way that everyone can relate and digest. <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieTulsi2020">#BernieTulsi2020</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotMeUs">#NotMeUs</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NoMoreWar">#NoMoreWar</a>Why did I know everything joe was going to ask?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> lol She wasn&#39;t going to answer the question even if she had an entire hourGo on Bernie give us one example of Climate Change predictions being even remotely close to factual in the last 20 years. I’m waiting?<br /><br />And why are the climate change crowd the same people who push open borders and non stop population increases. It seems to me population is THE key factor to environmental outcomes.So he won&#39;t be elected president?HoRee sheet mang!!! Cornel got to Rogan... props for giving him the chance to sit and speakThis is how we should hear what candidates have to say. Joe, your follow up questions were great. This Warren supporter has been persuaded by Senator Sanders tonight. :) I&#39;m feeling the Bern for the first time. It feels good.All candidates talk about Solar however no one talks about addressing the Toxic waste that comes from the creation of the batteries that store the electricity and the disposal of the batteries once they have &quot;died&quot;.  Even the mining of the chemicals used for the batteries is toxic to the countries that provide the minerals.all you people jumping on the Bernie train are retardedI&#39;m curious as to what Styx is gonna say. I also believe he should be on the show. I don&#39;t agree with him all the way, but the dude is interesting as fuck and has the means to make a magical podcast when paired with Joe.what im amazed it as a layman... is how surprised joe sounds about all this. its not rocket science. and im not a rocket scientist.Trump 2020This is amazing I don’t see how any one wouldn’t like sanders ideas 💡 thanks for the great interview joeAmerica’s Dad Bernie Sanders!!! 🇺🇸This feels like the first Jack Dorsey interview - joe is in gaga landYo when is Kanye appearing&quot;Were going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage&quot;  This has caused the homeless crisis in several liberal cities like LA, Seattle, Portland..... Get ready for the middle class and lower class to be on the streets.  People in Kentucky may be poor, but they live in doors.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=18m25s">18:25</a> I thought he said the other <b>itch</b>1 minute 14 seconds into it and I wanna die...... ughWill this geezer even make it to the elections?Go bernie! 2020Why not call him out on the term &#39; assualt weapons &#39; anything I can harm someone with from a toothpick to a any weapon can be considered an assault weapon wtf joe<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23COMRADEMcCONNELL">#COMRADEMcCONNELL</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SADISTSESSIONS">#SADISTSESSIONS</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DUMPTRUMP">#DUMPTRUMP</a>Yay!i fucking screamed when i saw the notificationfree health care = longer wait timeWho saw this one and said &quot;HOLY SHIT!&quot; like I did. lolJoe has never said so little. Great interviewPlenty of people bought the snake oil on this one. A millionaire socialist with three houses that was denied permits to start a for profit college on a large amount of land he bought all while saying &quot;millionaires shouldn&#39;t exist in today&#39;s society, no one needs more than one house, and college should be free&quot; so basically he&#39;s literally aganist every policy he promotes. Then he said &quot;whites don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot; meanwhile over 20 million white non Hispanics live below the poverty line and the state he represents is over 90% white with one of the highest poverty rates in the country. Good lord this guy has bamboozled a lot of people.You lost me at every psychologist, if something went wrong with education is because someone thought it was a good idea to listen to psychologists...If you get rid of single mothers you don&#39;t need a welfare state. Hey single mothers stop letting douche bags cum inside of youy did bernie go all red when joe asked him about the aliens?Canada better hope Bernie doesn&#39;t win. If he does, big pharma will raise the price in Canada to offset what they lose in the US.The only honest politician I&#39;ve ever heard. May the best man win. We need Bernie Sanders more than ever. Raise up working class let&#39;s take it back. Bernie for president.My god Bernie is a moronBernie&#39;s ideas are not even extreme, they are pretty on point with every other major developed nation. He wants to bring America back from the shithole country it&#39;s becoming.What would worry me the most if he did get elected is all of the batsh1t  crazy democrats that would follow him into office. Bernie has spent 40 years in gridlock politics...  I feel nothing will change, just more blame game &amp; gridlock.We were allied with China in World War II, I think he meant Japan :PWhy is Bernie using all of Andrew Yang&#39;s points now?Great interview, wish Bernie would have condemned White Supremacy which is the real problem not necessarily guns. Guns have issues but also need to look at the ideology behind these attacksBernie has no chanceNew plan, either Joe runs for president or he gets paid to do this for the candidates.... great episode. I&#39;m not sure that this will make me vote for him but I definitely like hearing his points clearly.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=8m12s">8:12</a> ehhh shoutout Windsor!I dont have a high school diploma, but i work a full time job, make good enough money, pay my own bills, support my kids no problem. I didn&#39;t go to jail or get hooked to drugs Bernie. Fuck you! Your part of the problemI was optimistic that Bernie would show himself to be a deep thinker able to articulate and demonstrate mastery of Policy and complex issues instead of making his usual shallow talking points. The good news is that I gave him his fair shake, and now I can say with confidence that he is not the man I want to see as president.Hey ,,perhaps I am wrong...  Lets ship the Anton LeVay California Black shutter house to Guantanamo bay..  Let them have their voodoo dolls and satan worship thereNever been drawn to Bernie, but good to see a long form discussion. Wished they would’ve delved deeper into the student debt issue. Why does this happen in the first place? Can we do anything to prevent kids from getting into insurmountable debt? Those issues were not addressed. I only heard short term solutions to a long term problem.I was with him for most of the first part concerning pharma and the problem not all his solutions but definitely the approach was decent. But his view on guns and wage constant insistence on legislating instead of freeing up he is a fucking moron.Joe Rogan is the perfect type of meathead that would fall for Bernie&#39;s fairytale, non-sense.Joe always talks about not picking teams and essentially not aligning himself with any specific ideologies yet he has a strong conservative following that hears what they want and ignores all of that and it’s hilarious. Just look at those dislikes lmao they feel betrayed.YES!!!!!!!Pls get Larry Elder onpodcasts&gt;newsI knew this was going to be full of softball BS! fuck joe, you know you can do better than this. Unprecedented opportunity to sit with a presidential candidate and really nail him down on real substance and you let this big government utopian fool spew talking points and nonsense.Democrats are perfectly fine with killing babies, but they don&#39;t want you to do drugs to cope with the idea of what you just did to an unborn child. Legalize everything because otherwise it just leads to illegal activity. Legalize Drugs, Legalize Abortion, Remove gun free zones so the people can properly defend themselves, Open up everything to everyone and watch the interest in these things fall in abuse. Where marijuana is legal, youth are smoking less and less since its more accepted and not such a taboo thing where they think they are cool by going in the woods and smoking a joint or shooting up heroine.I fucking LOVE BERNIE and more importantly the POLICIES he stands for!!! 👌🏽Population of Canada - 37million<br />Population of the US - 327 million<br />But he said they spent half of what the US does on health care, with 89% fewer people. Stop the tape right there. That’s why no one outside of your ignorant base will even listen to you. You crazy hack.refreshing to hear honest conversation...love the tone and the just the calmness of this interview...makes one want to listen and hear the oppositions view and maybe even learn something.  More of these interviews should happen with all candidates...Dems or Repubs.  Sick of attacks on everyone and everything...i want answers and conversation about candidates beliefs.Did larry have the pube in his throat again. He kept coughing it up!We don&#39;t need assault weapons to protect ourselves from criminals, we need assault weapons to protect ourselves from police.please have Lionel from lionel media on your showLol might as well have held up a sign that read “Government” with cartoon tits alongside, it would’ve been just as effective. <br />Fuck government handouts, you are all sheep. <br />Joe has seriously slipped over these years, and now with Bernie “breadlines are a good thing” Sanders. <br />Amazing.Socialism has killed millions of people.As a huge fan of joe I just gotta say!!!!! YOUR CONTENT HAS REALLY TOOK A DIVE THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS!!!!! Love ya thoI think he is right about helathcare. I believe in a welfare system, being Swedish and all. But it doesn&#39;t work with mass-migration (invasion). This interview felt stressed btw.Dirty Bernie picked his nose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=38m17s">38:17</a>Triggered right wing snowflake NPC&#39;s seeking a safe space in the comments lmaooooooYang2020!!My question is this, if the country is such a terrible place live like Sanders says then why in hell do millions of people risk there lives to come here? Sanders is an idiot that will break this country if he has his way and destroy the health care system by lowering the quality of care for everyone. He needs to go live in Russia where he got married if he thinks socialism/communism is so wonderful.Bernie needs to listen to Tim Pool in regards to the min wage - Ton of cuts in nyc hours, jobs, and closings - why not make it 20 and 30You want to stop the shootings? You want a solution to the problems in this country? The first thing we do, even before guns, even before we address money in politics-we reinstate standards in public affairs programming in this country. We kick out these RW political pornographers, who have done more to demoralize people in this country than anything else-for 30 YEARS NOW. They sell what they do as &quot;balance&quot;, but what it is is false equivalence. You can see them doing it for these shootings, &amp; trump&#39;s rhetoric. They shave &amp; plane down all the factors, turning everything into a he-said, she-said, tit-for-tat, it&#39;s all the same, they&#39;re all the same! Throw your hands up, give up-GIVE IN. This idea was reflected in the El Paso shooter&#39;s manifesto-the idea that we can&#39;t resolve problems through thoughtful debate, or hold power to any account.A communist (((Jew))) who wants to disarm the public is exactly what we need right nowThis podcast should be interestingDemocratic socialism = socialism<br /><br />Good job Venezuela!!!Climate change is a hoax. Bernie is wacko.get trump on , make him smoke weedHe is spot on - nobody is being elected for their intellectual capability or their political clout anymore but because of their character and eccentricity - Mr Donald Trump and Mr Boris Johnson in the UK.I&#39;m a pro second amendment 1st amendment proponentRogan would be the best moderator. Naturally empathetic while still being objective and seeing incongruity<br />Edit. Make it several hours like the good ole days. Better yet no time limit cage match . bernie knows his shit and trump is barely jumping on his own bandwagon. But once Bernie is in office, same ole shit unless he actually has the backup that he talked about in the beginningI’m from Canada- healthcare works- dummies.Getting off work at midnight and seeing Bernie is on Joe Rogan.  Gonna be an awesome ride home. Cheers!Bring Bernie on again to talk more in depth. This interview was gold.He fukn killed the end <br />finished strong 💪Bernie is a nutI really like his Concepts. But if you start taxing large corporations and increase the minimum wage. They will take their business outside the country. The unemployment rate will rise. Poverty will increase. I wish there was some kind of Middle Ground.My only gripe with this interview is simply this... Joe didn&#39;t press Bernie hard enough.  2nd Bernie&#39;s answers were and is his current talking points. There were no real concrete solutions. IMO this interview was scripted Bernie actually gave real solutions were the gun/ assault rifle issue... meh interview... Joe needs to step it up like the interview with tweeter CEO.Oh YIPPEE the pickle salesmanThe population of Canada is 35.6 million people, 291.0 million more people live in United States...yeah it’s math. Good luck with that Bernie. Great interview though.Get iraqveteran8888 on here!!!!12 seconds in and I am quietly praying that Joe Rogan doesn&#39;t soft ball this one.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=08m00s">08:00</a> - Let drug companies from Canada and other western countries sell insulin and other drugs into the US to bring drug prices down. Do the same for insurance companies. Open the market to competition. You will get access, quality, and affordability.Any new supporters for Bernie in here? 😀Hey look it&#39;s Bernie the millionaire that wants your money. Minus 500 kewl points for having that socialist bastard on.  Piece of fucking shit.Great interview.<br /><br /><br /><br />I like and support Bernie and considering myself a Progressive I&#39;m with him on pretty much all his ideas , but I hate hearing him talk about Assault Weapons and Assault Weapon Bans. It is nothing but a bunch of crap. Like he even said, we had the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 that lasted until 2004. During that time we had two of our most infamous mass shooting, the North Hollywood Shootout in 1997, and Columbine in 1999. It did nothing to stop them. There were certainly other less known incidences that didn&#39;t get any coverage during that time as well. Such a ban only punishes law abiding citizens and does nothing to stop people with ill intent. Lets not forget Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people and injured over 700 others in a matter of seconds and he didn&#39;t use a gun of any type. As far as I know diesel fuel and fertilizer is still legal to buy.<br /><br /><br /><br />At one time an everyday citizen could order a fully automatic machine gun through the mail and have it shipped to their home. There weren&#39;t mass shootings going on back then. The reasons the laws were changed were because of the gangsters of the 1930s. Did outlawing them stop the gangsters from getting them? No. <br /><br /><br /><br />All of the problems we&#39;re experiencing in our country as well as all over the world is due to our economy, as well as everywhere else, being destroyed and taken over by the financial industry. A few people getting filthy rich by destroying everything they can, taking as much as they can from everyone else. When society hurts all the problems explode. As long as there is a desire to kill, the person with that desire will find a way to accomplish the task, gun or no gun. We need to do as much as we can to fix our economy and country.<br /><br /><br />Not to mention, everywhere one looks there is nothing but violence. Movies, TV, music videos, video games, MMA (Joe won&#39;t want to hear that). The news is one of the worst, sensationalizing every bad thing they can to get ratings. For the last forty years our country has had a me, me, me, crush, kill, destroy mentality crammed down our throats. You pretty much can&#39;t turn on the TV without seeing someone getting shot. Then here on Youtube you have all these firearms experts screaming about being ready, you&#39;re not safe, be afraid, be ready to shoot first and ask questions later.The sensationalizing and romanticizing of guns sure doesn&#39;t help things either but it sure helps sell them.This video will never get close to a true podcast with alex Jones where you can actually hear them speak without the volume on full. If Rogan got trump on the podcast that would be the most viewed video everTwo giant issues that was not brung up about increasing the minimum wage was, if the minimum wage for all employees is increased, wont everything go up in price in accordance with the minimum wage increase? Therefore making the wage increase redundant while also destroying 1000&#39;s of jobs.<br /><br /><br />Another is for young people entering the workforce is, if Bernies wage increase is put into effect, why hire a young inexperienced person when you can hire an experienced older person for the same cost?I like Bernie. But how about instead of giving up our guns, stop selling psychiatric medications that CAUSE homicidal thoughts?? Look at the statistics. The vast majority of mass shooters  have taken, are taking these meds. Stick to healthcare, living wage, Berners.There’s some really deceiving stuff here that bothers me. I urge people to do some real research into the insulin problem in the US, it’s not just simply drug companies are bad and want to make a profit. There is a huge list of reasons the price of insulin is so high. Like the crazy regulations implemented on insulin that has caused companies to wait until 2020 to submit their patent to put more insulin alternatives into the market, thus lowering the price. It’s pretty ironic that one of the REAL issues with the price of insulin, stems from over regulation. When Bernie is screaming we need more regulation. And as a Canadian I can tell you our healthcare is terrible. people are dying on waiting lists. We end up spending large sums of money to go to other countries for surgeries and other care because of insane waiting lists and terrible care. We have clinics that limit patients to one symptom per visit. Our doctors get payed per patient not by the time spent with the patient. Meaning there is ZERO incentive to help you, your rushed in and out. It sickens me to listen to this guy pretend like he cares so much for people.Please, VOTE Bernie. I beg of you!I say Joe Rogan interviews ALL the Presidential Candidates! GO JOE! You are Awesome Dude! Please get TRUMP on your show....    Bernie, is a cool dude but there&#39;s no way the United States will ever be a Denmark or Switzerland... The people in those countries actually WORK! that&#39;s the difference....  I fear the United states will become Venezuela if socialists take over...  Capitalism is the only way to promote that hard work pays off... Competition is REQUIRED in successful societies...I&#39;m from Canada and would vote for this guy.We need to GIVE BERNIE SANDERS GUANTANAMO  BAY HEALTH CARE..  I hear there is a TACO BELL THERE..  Good luck Bernie SandersWhile in the house of representatives Bernie passed so many amendments he earned the moniker the amendment king, some of the highlights include:<br /><br />Corporate Crime Accountability (February 1995): A Sanders amendment to the Victims Justice Act of 1995 required “offenders who are convicted of fraud and other white-collar crimes to give notice to victims and other persons in cases where there are multiple victims eligible to receive restitution.”<br /><br />Saving Money, for Colleges and Taxpayers (April 1998): In an amendment to H.R. 6, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, Sanders made a change to the law that allowed the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education to make competitive grants available to colleges and universities that cooperated to reduce costs through joint purchases of goods and services.<br /><br />Holding IRS Accountable, Protecting Pensions (July 2002): Sanders&#39; amendment to the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 2003 stopped the IRS from being able to use funds that “violate current pension age discrimination laws.” Although he faced stiff GOP opposition, his amendment still succeeded along a 308 to 121 vote.<br /><br />Expanding Free Health Care (November 2001): You wouldn&#39;t think Republicans would agree to an expansion of funds for community health centers, which provide some free services. But Sanders was able to win a $100 million increase in funding with an amendment.<br /><br />Increasing Funding for Heating for the Poor (September 2004): Sanders won a $22 million increase for the low-income home energy assistance program and related weatherization assistance program.<br /><br />Fighting Corporate Welfare and Protecting Against Nuclear Disasters (June 2005): A Sanders amendment brought together a bipartisan coalition that outnumbered a bipartisan coalition on the other side to successfully prohibit the Export-Import Bank from providing loans for nuclear projects in China.<br /><br />He passed the above amendments that were exclusively progressive forging unlikely partnerships with bipartisan coalitions of Republicans who wanted to shrink government or hold it accountable and progressives who wanted to use it to empower Americans.<br /><br />While senator in 06&#39; he continued seeking idealogical partnerships continuing his streak which included these amendments:<br /><br />Greening the U.S. Government (June 2007): A Sanders amendment made a change to the law so at least 30 percent of the hot water demand in newer federal buildings is provided through solar water heaters.<br /><br />Protecting Our Troops (October 2007): Sanders used an amendment to win $10 million for operation and maintenance of the Army National Guard, which had been stretched thin and overextended by the war in Iraq.<br /><br />Restricting the Bailout to Protect U.S. Workers (Feburary 2009): A Sanders amendment required the banking bailout to utilize stricter H-1B hiring standards to ensure bailout funds weren&#39;t used to displace American workers.<br /><br />Helping Veterans&#39; Kids (July 2009): A Sanders amendment required the Comptroller General to put together comprehensive reporting on financial assistance for child care available to parents in the Armed Forces.<br /><br />Exposing Corruption in the Military-Industrial Complex (November 2012): A Sanders amendment required “public availability of the database of senior Department officials seeking employment with defense contractors” – an important step toward transparency that revealed the corruption of the revolving door in action.<br /><br />Support for Treating Autism in Military Health Care: Sanders worked with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) to pass an amendment by a vote of 66-29 ensuring that the military&#39;s TRICARE system would be able to treat autism.<br />His biggest successes came when Sanders was able to get the first-ever audit of funds given out by the Federal Reserve, which made transparent over $2 trillion of funds handed out by the secretive organization. This was a cause that Republican congressman Ron Paul (TX) had been pursuing for decades, but Sanders was able to get the votes to do it by forging a compromise that required an audit for the bailout period alone.<br /><br />When the Affordable Care Act was in danger of not having the votes to pass, Sanders used his leverage to win enough funding for free health treatment for 10 million Americans through Community Health Centers. Holding out until the funds were put into the bill.Bernie looks like he needs to get the ring dingerI’m good. I don’t want to pay anymore in taxes. I want to keep my money and be left alone.America used to be led by great men. Not the case anymore. Us and the media are major cause for this. If you keep believing all the lies then it&#39;s not going to get better. Bernie is talking about changing allot of things that NEED TO BE changed. Our political system is corrupt. Until you open your eyes and see it for what it actually is.... It&#39;s not going to change. Vote for Bernie and listen to him. He truly cares. Stop listening to the false air time these groups of wealthy ppl spew in order to sway you. Stop listening to these corporations and SUPERPACS. Vote for Bernie and let&#39;s start putting America back on top. If not.... Reality will catch up and it will be to late. That&#39;s human nature though isn&#39;t it? Don&#39;t change or see it until it&#39;s too late.Whoever is strongest on the environment, that&#39;s who gets my vote.  Not just messy regulations;  funding innovation, moving some subsidies from fossil fuels to sustainable fuel, removing obstacles to change.Am I the only 1 finds it ironic that Bernie holds out the idea that other countries political systems are somehow better?Bernie should do a real segment with Ben Shapiro, someone who&#39;d hold his feet to the fire.Joe secured the bag💰Phenomenal interview. Very clear. Bernie actually cares. The US is the world leading country and should pave the way to new ways of living. If you’ve never been to Europe then you have no concept on what he’s talking about.Well I do agree with Bernie about Joe bringing Mitch to talk about all the issues presented today and more. In fact, whynot bring them both (I&#39;m pretty sure Bernie would never agree to it btw)I&#39;m trying to understand this. Bernie says government isn&#39;t negotiating prices with drug makers, and wants Medicare to expand. But Medicare invented PBM&#39;s to negotiate lower drug costs. Big PBM&#39;s have gotten out of control, led to increased drug costs, and have recently found their way into courtrooms. <br /><br />Bernie wants to increase Medicare coverage and have government negotiate drug prices, but have we not tried this and failed already? Not saying he his ideas are bad, would just love to hear Bernie go more in depth on his plan for PBM regulations and drug price negotiating...I was listening intently right up until the point he started with the &quot;assault weapon&quot; propaganda. The fact is the vast majority of gun deaths are NOT caused by rifles or &quot;assault weapons&quot;, this is simply a mainstream media talking point that has been repeated so many times people are starting to believe it&#39;s true.Losers focus on Winners. Winners focus on winning.Money money moneyMoney money moneyI vote to have the debates on JRE. 2 at a time each day for a couple of weeks.Wow this was incredible. I wish it would have gone for longer. I really get the sense that this is an important turning point in American and internet culture. Joe Rogan said it best, the Pres. is in charge of managing all of these important ideas and try to make a decision on them. It matters. And it sure as hell matters that we know where people stand. I loved this format, I loved the questioning and thought that went into them. As well as Bernie&#39;s empathetic, wise and well thought out ideas on how to go about them.What a fucking joke that everyone is cheering on Bernie Sanders. Wow. Wow. SheepI dont thing he will win over trumpYang GangI am a Canadian and he is wrong about the quality of care. Is it great that we don&#39;t get saddled with a major bill? Yes, of course. But the wait times are insane. I had a surgery on my uvula as it was too long and it needed to be cut in half. It was a simple surgery and because of this I wasn&#39;t put on a wait list (which is also a major criticism of the Canadian health care system). The surgery was simple, they simply freeze  your uvula, and then they cut it in half. At first it was a success, but it wasn&#39;t until I went back to my place where the freezing wore off that I started choking on my own blood. It was dripping blood like a leaking faucet. At first I thought this was normal and that it would just heal, but after a couple days of not being able to eat anything but soup and coughing up blood constantly I decided to go to the Royal Alexander Hospital in Edmonton to see what was up. My skin was white, I was 10 pounds lighter, so I knew something went wrong with the minor surgery. <br />It was around 12 am  when I arrived in the emergency waiting room of the hospital, there was only  one other person in the waiting room. I told the receptionist that I had a bleeding throat...sounds serious enough, but it took over 4 hours to see a doctor. During these 4 hours, there was literally no one sitting in the waiting room but this other man and myself, and I had a friggin&#39; throat that was bleeding .  However, every once in a while, we would notice people that were obviously high or drunk being admitted before us. I don&#39;t know why that was the case, but it just was. <br />Once I was able to see a doctor, he told me that the surgeon cut into a blood vessel which means he botched the minor surgery. He then gave me some percocets and told me to stay away from hard foods and sent me on my way. <br />Wait times in Canada and quality of care are a major issue in the health care system.  People have actually died in the waiting rooms of Canadian hospitals. <br />The doctors in Canada are fine, but Canada&#39;s health care system being amazing is an absolute myth. Here is an article from my home city discussing some of the challenges. <br /><a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/edmonton-emergency-departments-nearing-critical-condition-doctors-say">https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/edmonton-emergency-departments-nearing-critical-condition-doctors-say</a>First time hearing really listening to this man talk. ashamed to say i bought into the idea that hes too far left. I actually really respect him. Seems very genuine. May just vote for him.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m50s">47:50</a> i gotta pay a fine soon dammitI Love my country 🇺🇸Lol He dodged Joe&#39;s legalize all drugs question, to be fair it&#39;s a tough question to answer on the spot.11k down votes from botsAmazing people call this guy a socialist. You conservatives need to wake up, the Republican party only benefits the wealthy.I despise the use of the term “assault weapons” every weapon is an assault weapon. I get the point but we need to be demonizing the people instead of the tools being used by the peopleWhen he calls white privilege a problem, he loses meTriggered right wing as indicated by the like-dislike ratiobring tulsi againJust imagine if he would have won the election :/Lolif climate change isn&#39;t a hoax why did a [panel of 4 scientists come to the supreme court and expose it as a hoax ...you can literally look it up.Its repulsive the amount of people who care about politics. The govnt was meant to be small and boring and not affect our lives. That is the only reason why we are the richest country who flourished when everyone was being ruled. People seem to forget that these politicians are in a business too, and their business has no customers, their only objective is to get as many people as possible to believe they have their best interest in mind, only to advance their position. Govnt is a disease that has no treatment, it only grows and destroys. It can never create, it can only take. The only way to stifle govnt is to focus on the individual. The people you see carrying political banners and buy into the game show dont focus on themselves but outward, these are the sheep politicians feed on, they&#39;re easily manipulated. Look at every civilization in the history of this planet, you will see not one example where a govnt didn&#39;t grow and grow until it destroyed its economy and people, physically or mentally. It governs ideas, governs growth, governs creation, governs free will, governs our ability to reach our full potential as humans. Dont forget the govnt is made of people, people who&#39;s sole purpose is to advance their own position, and prey on their neighbors, making them more and more dependent on them to grow to prosper. All the freedom we could ever need is laid out in the constitution, the single most important document ever created in human history, without it, we would have never seen the greatest advancement in human history.he&#39;s going to get shot for speaking too much truthBernie, I can get behind some of your idea but you never have the numbers, your emphatic explanations and lack of detail only have emotional appeal. Great microphone voice though.Hopefully Joe can get other candidates, liberal and conservative, on his podcast.Good for you and Bernie for doing this. It&#39;s time to build bridges and start having real conversations.I was waiting for him to hit the dooooooobJoe hogan should run as Berns  VPIf this lunatic gets in the new tax form will be as follows: Line A: how much did you make this year, Line B: send it all in!Challenge: watch at half speed and see how far you can get.<br /><br />I could only take the amount of time that it took to write this. <br /><br />Bernie (Not Utopian) Sanders&quot;impose tax on wallstreet speculation&quot; There&#39;s already capital gains taxes. People should be allowed to invest their own money without paying taxes out their ass. I agree that American healthcare is a joke, if you get sick you are financially ruined.Just remember, if it were up to him, he’d be running as an independent...so if your argument for thumbing this down is that he’s on the “other team”, you don’t know him at all.My only complaint is that they didnt go the full 3 hoursObviously Bernie doesn&#39;t understand (or more likely doesn&#39;t want to tell us) how the pharmaceutical patent system works.  Want new drugs? Want cheap alternatives? That&#39;s what we got today.This was an excellent interview!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>If you vote for this idiot,  your are no different than the people who think the world is free.  Go make something of yourself.  Its just like the rest of the dems..  Outside of Gabbard they are all morons, and seem to think they have it all figured out.  Please, for God&#39;s Sake, show me a policy from the left that is even worth a fuck..  Not the &quot;Green New Deal&quot; either.  That is a complete joke.. and a bad one at thatI feel the bern.When he says we will pay for it, he means us. He means the middle class. So me, yeah fuck Bernie.Should have asked him about the emails and why the primary was stolen from him last time... I wonder what happens this time...Jeffrey Epstein, Clintons, Bernie Sanders gives away all the the funds from his people and constituents,,  Then videos and research proves that this money is connected to Jeffery Epstein Pedophile Island..  The New Mexico &quot;Zorro Ranch&quot;,,the New York NXIVM Allison Mack Sex Cult, Keith Raniere, the connections,, the Leslie Wexner, Ghislaine Maxwell, etc..  So much info Bernie?...  Pyramids do not work Bernie.  NWO is FINISHEDthe ONLY sane choice is bernieWord on the street is, after the podcast ended, Joe exited the studio while Bernie continued talking to Joe’s seat since the seat had a better attention span than Rogan.I would like to see each candidate on Joes podcast...but after listening to Bernie i dont need too..Surprised he didn&#39;t ask him about DMTMoney only has that power so long as people accept it...you can walk away from this corrupt cesspit of a system...its just not so easy, you have be get creative!I liked this interview more than any other with Bernie. I don&#39;t agree with a lot of his policy ideas but I feel he loves people. I don&#39;t think his ideas get is there. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23KAG">#KAG</a>I think Bernie is a good man, I hope he endorses Andrew Yang. Ubi &gt; Minimum wageBAM RIGHT OUT THE GATE HE BRINGS UP UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE!!! CANADA LOVES YOU BERNIE!!!!! Wake up people this man NEEDS TO BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. He will change the entire fucking world!!!  .... for the better. Quit letting the  NRA and the PHARMACIES and BIG TOBACCO etc... run your country. Its ONLY HURTING YOU!!Democratic Socialism/Communism by god I hope not in the USARogan, you fucking con-man, piece of shit, YOU OWE BERNIE A FACE TO FACE APOLOGY for acting like the dumbass you are and saying you lost all your faith in Bernie because he shunned a shit-bag, con-man, right-wing troll reporter and acted like he was on the phone.<br /><br />Sanders has been the most consistent and morally solid politician this country has ever had,the most  ardent supporter of equal rights since he was a teenager, and spent his life fighting for equality for EVERYONE.<br /><br />But your dumb fucking ass went on record slamming him and calling him &quot;phony&quot; for not wanting to talk to a fucking piece of suit republican troll.<br /><br />YOU&#39;RE A GOD DAMEND INTELLECTUAL COWARD AND ULTIMATELY YOU&#39;RE THE PHONY, ROGAN.So what do all of us peasents that didn&#39;t go to college get? Lol that sucks bro, try making bad decisions next time.It&#39;s not about a redistribution of wealth. It&#39;s that THEY, the CORPORATION and INSANELY RICH AREN&#39;T PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE!!! They haven&#39;t been distributing their wealth fairly.&quot;It came from the federal reserve.&quot; bahahahahahahaaah for someone who has always been against the &quot;machine&quot;, sure has no problem using their stats! I&#39;m fucking dead! Tsk tsk I hope Joe ask some better questions in this interview!Medicare for all is the most amazing and obvious solution, vampiric insurance companies be damned to hell, and we should quit being so arrogant and recognize we are as a nation the international bully every nation understands to be the greatest threat and take a step back and look out for life over profit. Imagind being killed by a drone without understanding why.Feel the Burn - Mr. Bernie Sanders 2020 - Hell Yeah!  ;-)We really Bernie to win this time around..... He gets it!BERNIE 2020I feel like Biden is gonna win the nomination tbh no matter what even tho I haven’t seen one supporter of his<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>I always felt like I am pretty decent at seeing both sides of an argument. But when it comes to Bernie’s ideas and policies I have a hard time understanding how anyone would oppose them. He truly wants what’s best for the American people. He speaks with such sincerity and wholeheartedly believes in what he’s fighting for. I really hope this helps open up some eyes to him now that he’s had a chance to explain what he’s trying to accomplish.Bernie &quot;Snake Oil&quot; Sanders.Good to see bernie on here, thanks joe!Dislike this man much less than before haha praises to the JRE. I’m pretty conservative but lobbying is horrendous and the healthcare system here is a joke.Are you fucking kidding me?!?! 0.5% tax on trades and we get free education?!?! Our government needs to get their priorities straight! Holy fuck.Trump 2020That dude sounds dillusional af....Why try to change our gun control laws! I mean we already tried nothing to fix the problems!God I love how he talks about how to build an economy around preventing climate change.I&#39;m a big Trump supporter and I can honestly say I like Bernie I just disagree with how he wants to implement things in such a radical fashion. I feel like if he didn&#39;t have this kind of approach he would have a legitimate shot of winning the presidency.Not me. <b>Us.</b><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Holy shit.  Historical.I most likely will not vote for Bernie, but I give him respect for coming onImagine if Joe can get all the major candidates to sit around a table and have a long form discussion while Jamie fact checks any stats or info they need. That would probably be the most important debate they could have.Treat guns just like cars license registration and insurance. And then treat assault weapons design for military use just like tanks. Sure you can get one if you really really want but you are going to need some pretty extensive permits to show that you are responsible enough to own that kind of hardware. <br /><br />And yes there are private citizens with tanks look it up.Wait how did y’all vote trump in 😂 this dude is smart and actually wants people to move up<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m33s">1:04:33</a> Socialists always fail history class.As a Canadian, I agree with everything he&#39;s saying, and I&#39;ve never paid a cent for medical in my life and I just goto the walk-in clinic every time I feel like I need to. I pay for prescriptions from time to time but its like $25 for antibiotics. I&#39;d like to see what Bernie could actually do down there in the USA, Canada&#39;s toilet.For someone who&#39;s been in politics for 126 years  he said he didn&#39;t have the answers quite a lot 😂Bernie Tulsi 2020Good stuff. Fair interview.YES. feelin&#39; the berrrrrn.I live in Romania (which is not even close to U.S. in economy or anything actually , except maybe internet speed) and insulin here is free from the state if you are diagnosed with diabetes , you only pay for it (and it very cheap) if you wanna use it for animals/pets. And our healthcare system is considered the worst in the European Union :PBernie literally just complained the whole time. We need a leader with solutions not someone that just tells us everything we already know is wrong with society. What are you going to do about these problems Bernie....And the number of times Bernie cited history...... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yawn">#yawn</a>Since Bernie and Joe fans support legalized marijuana,  support the great state of North Dakota&#39;s legalization efforts at <a href="http://www.legalizend2020.com/">www.LegalizeND2020.com</a> Why should you care about North Dakota? Because once a conservative midwest state does it&#39;s the rest will follow. 41% in 2018... 51% in 2020. Colorado had almost the same result in 2006Sanders-Gabbard 2020. The power team!Feel the bern.... :)Great conversation. This was a million times better than watching the democratic debates.What a load of crap! Easy questions and absolutely NO FOLLOW UPS! Bernie was asked what he would do if he became president to accomplish his plans, the old man started rambling about the same script of all times, the top 1%, the student loans debt, etc! No follow ups whatsoever but actually enforcement! Later on Bernie drops the 12 year deadline for climate change and Joe has 0 follow ups on the same matter he has previously called a stupid projection (the 12 years bullshit), then the 15 dollars an hour wage, again asked how business would implement that and answer is “you just do it” holy fuck! Damn it Bernie, let’s just cure cancer! Let’s just end starvations, let’s just turn everything into unicorns shitting gold! After all, you just need to do it! I knew for a while after Joe stabbed Alex Jones in the back repeatedly (and I can’t fucking believe I’m making a point for Alex wacko gay frogs Jones) that he was just a mouthpiece for the media and the leftists radicals! I must have watched about 300 episodes of JRE but this for sure is my last one, I had had enough with the first one on Jack Dorsey, but this is an even new low! <br />Then they talk about gun control, something Joe supposedly didn’t approve of. Bernie starts throwing the stupid term “assault weapon” which is not even a defined term!!! And starts saying “it’s designed to kill people in a quick manner” well yes stupid, guns are designed to kill! That’s why we have them to defend ourselves! Against commies like you when you and your buddy Maduro run an armored army car against a crowd of protesters! Jo says NOTHING about that! He doesn’t point out how many crimes are prevented because of armed civilians, he doesn’t call Bernies bullshit about background checks so I will, bernie asks for background checks to see if a potential buyer has committed crimes, been charged with domestic violence, has mental health issues and such...... ALL THOSE EXITST ALREADY in the current background check you need to fill to buy a gun! Then the cherry on the pie, the mythic “gun show loophole” a total piece of bullshit that Joe KNOWS IS A LIE!!! And he let’s commie Sanders get away with spreading it on his show!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fuckoffjoe">#fuckoffjoe</a> you’re a joke!I would love to hear Eddie Bravo on thisHe has my vote<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NoOne2020">#NoOne2020</a>Most funny president candidate in history 😂Pharmaceutical companies are straight up evil.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=3m02s">3:02</a> It took Bernie only 3 minutes to propose state controlled TelevisionAs much as I disagree with Bernie and his policies.......America and it&#39;s people need to come to a realization that we need to openly discuss what is going on and hear from all sides.....wake up people and come togetherOoohhhh shit, I love Joe i never thought he’d have Bernie onYangSo an hour with bernie and you didnt challenge him in any if the seriously misleading information and outright lies he was peddling <br />Like oh yeah Medicare for is a great, he left out the part where his plan bans private insurance. Including employer provided insurance which 60% of americans are covered by. <br />Yes joe you&#39;d have to be on medicare or pay cash.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=46m35s">46:35</a> &quot;more people in US prisons than China&quot;   isn&#39;t there an entire system of &#39;re-education&#39; camps in China that would easily qualify as a prison, and that dwarfs the US system?Can someone share a timestamp for when Bernie starts smoking weed? I can&#39;t find it..Its great to see millionaires who&#39;ve already made their wealth and aquired millions in hard assets talking about raising taxes on the next generation coming up. Their savings will never be taxed because theyve allready earned it. Its like watching that video of billionaires talking about how they wish the gov would raise their taxes. IF YOURE A MILLIONAIRE OR BILLIONAIRE THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING YOU FROM WRITING A BIGGER CHECK TO THE IRS. <br />Essentially what they are advocating for is a system in which you people who are coming up trying to grind will fund all the programs that they want. While these guys had to sacrifice 3 or 4 months of their life force every year to fund the state, they are turning around and advocating for younger generations to work for 6-8 months of every year of their life for free. Thats called slavery. Unless youre going to force unproductive peopple to sacrifice and equal amount of their life every year in seevice of the state then youre essentially advocating for the economic enslavement of the productive minority. This is why democracy is a failed system.BS Podcast just like the Twitter one with Jack. Not calling him out on his shit. Letting him ramble with out cross examination. This man is a crazy old idiot -As he was talking about how they interrupt w drug ads I get one too lolI can&#39;t watch anymore of this, it&#39;s been 6 mins... All this is crazy I live in canada and the health care is bullshit, I have had my ingrown toenail operated on 3 times and I went to a private doctor to fix it, and I paid out of my pocket. This &quot;I want Canada&#39;s health care system AND extend it to dental, hearing aids ands eye glasses as well...&quot; hey look at all those jobs out the window tooDon&#39;t agree with 99.9% of what the guy has to say but it is cool to get long form discussions from all viewpointsDoctors lied about tobacco but we must believe scientists... not saying nothing but seems suspect put like that huhI haven&#39;t listened yet but one of the  most beautiful things about Joe&#39;s podcast is his ability to make robots with a cause on their home platform sound like people on his platform. I&#39;m sceptical this will be a good example but we&#39;ll see!15 dollars an hour in California is not much still. What about a federal minimum wage that benefits states rights and a cost of living index. 15 dollars and hour in San Francisco is poor its poor every where in California. 15 in Detroit Michigan is balling. It&#39;s still uneven. States decide or at least it varies state to state, with a federal minimum wage higher, based off a index decided by the fed in each state. If it was a minimum wage that&#39;s the same that high you would just see that city or state become overpopulated until the cost of living went up based on the demand for housing, food, jobs, cars, clothes. Basic necessities. Then we&#39;d be talking about raising the minimum wage again.I LOVE HIM! Today Real Clear Politics polls have him beating Trump in TEXAS!!!! This is the ONLY person who has had a consistent record for 40 years! This is the ONLY candidate not taking money from big $ donors. We needs Medicare for All! People are dying because for profit insurance companies are NOT in business to protect our wellbeing. People die because they&#39;re $20 short for a monthly payment. We&#39;re dying to enrich big pharma, big insurance, and breaking out backs to support corporate welfare peddled as tax reform.If the CIA started the crack trade to wipe out black Americans. The maybe the opioid epidemic in flyover country was started by the same outfit. Just this time it was a person of color. Maybe Barry Soto or Richard Windsor.God bless this man &amp; give him your votes!!Bernie&#39;s voice makes me wetI really wish after Joe said &quot;imagine making a decision when your brain isn&#39;t even fully formed thats gonna impact you for the rest of your life &quot; he asked Bernie about hormone blockers for 3 year olds that say they feel like the opposite genderDamn Joe..Your mass shooting to statistics are incorrect. Go do research on what they consider mass shootings how many people have to die and how much about is gang violence in Chicago and Baltimore these are common sense thoughts guysHell yeah!God damnit it’s the same exact problem I saw with Dr. West. No actual back and fourth substance, no push back, no contradicting data. Really one sided. People like Joe because he usually has deep and thoughtful responses to his guests answers. He keeps playing soft ball with lefties, where he digs deeper with righty’s.Disgusting that over 11k people disliked this just because of their view maybe you don’t stand by him I personally don’t fully but just view something without judgement this was a great episode and really had good talking points for what America needs people are so like minded anymore just open up and learn I feel even joe could agree<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23feelthebern">#feelthebern</a>Really, you worked us 15 hours a day to afford to pay for my kids college and those who were working half that kid’s college too! If it is Medicare and education for all then “ALL” had better be working like we are working! That is where I will “feel the Bern”! And do not tell me there are no jobs for them while telling me immigrants are coming to fill all those available jobs in the US like grass cutting and sheet rock hanging because I have friends who work in those industries. I am not stupid! If people in America are too lazy to cut grass and hang sheet rock, they do not deserve my tax dollars to live!!!!Do you think Joe will get the other candidates on here? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha no.We have healthcare welfare. Thats Why the prices are more....come on really? Its not out of pocket unless you make decent money...then it is!vote for me or the world will end?? lolBernie &#39;other country&#39;s` sandersHow can you not agree with Bernie &lt;3<br />Sounds argumentsAll this greed is causing the Poverty, and poverty is the downfall of America...Not even gonna challenge him on the real reason for the 2A? pretty weak dude.<br /><br />Also didn&#39;t press him on the 15hr craziness.Joe may as well have a fucking cnn or abc logo on his microphone.The top 1 percent must be insane because they and their families do not need and cannot personally consume that amount of money.  What will be left when they are dead will reveal the &#39;excess&#39;.  These people have to be psychotic.  How can you have more than you need and still want more?If Bernie doesn&#39;t get high he&#39;s not getting my vote.I would take Bernie seriously if he would put up his detailed plans and proposals on his site in the same way I have to present my plans, proposals and reports to &quot;C&quot; level executives and clients. Ross Perot would&#39;ve had a field day if he had the internet.The Ben Shapiro video has over five million views. Hopefully that&#39;s largely because it&#39;s been up much longer and more people will watch this.Check out Andrew Yang. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a>Hey Bernie you can buy insulin for $25 at Walmart versus doctors prescribing Humalog which cost $350 or more a vile at other stores that sell it so you didn’t half to go to Canada to get that insulin you can get it here in the USALove seeing this ❤️👍👍👍 Bernie 2020 ✌️Fuck Bernie he’s an old goof(To be clear: I&#39;m a socialist, I&#39;m not on the right) - Here&#39;s a good example why Joe Rogan is not a boogeyman right wing stenographer. Of course, he <i>could</i> do better, but in the past week he&#39;s given a platform to Cornel West and Bernie Sanders. He sat down and listened and posed questions that Bernie could answer is a fair way. Cornel West was able to present clear and in depth arguments on socialism with an analysis of history. This is a <i>good</i> thing and I&#39;m glad Bernie came on.Banning assault weapons DOES NOT PREVENT MASS SHOOTINGS IN ANY CAPACITY YOU IGNORAMUS.President Sanders:  All I&#39;m asking is to expand medicare to 55, 45, 35... 25, babies.  And that&#39;s all, and free college for only everyone and that&#39;s it, plus living wage for just only all Americans... and immigrants... Legal and illegal, and that&#39;s it!  Oh, and replacing only all gas stations in 12 years, and equal outcomes for all women workers, and nothing else, except reparations by taxing just 3 people but nothing more...<br /><br />Me:  Leaving US asap.Cant agree more with most of the subjects spoken about other than tossing out fossil fuels...lost me on that one.This Guy wanna be a President? Wtf whats wrong with the States !?!?!?! 😂BURNED KNEE! BURNED KNEE! BURNED KNEE!Fuck the drug and insurance companies. They run this country but it needs to be stopped.IGNORE THE DISLIKES JOE IS A SAINTDoes anyone know what built america? Capitalism! Without capitalism we become like every other country. If you give everything away like Bernie is talking about doing which will never happen because he&#39;s a politician and he makes a living talking a great game but never delivers. When we allow radicals to take control the only change in wealth will be to the government leaders. Just look at China, Russia. If you raise minimum wage to 15 businesses close their doors or prices increase and the business go automated. I wish we lived in such a great world were we could all stay in bed and sleep in then get up and have a check in the mail just because but life doesn&#39;t work that way and this man is lying to you if you can&#39;t see that he is just saying what people want to hear but doesn&#39;t actually accomplish any of his bs then what good does it do to elect him. I didn&#39;t vote last time but after seeing what Trump has actually accomplished in 3 years your an idiot if you vote someone else in when the man obviously is doing it for the country. Trump could retire anytime he wants but he came out beat the odds and kept every campaign promise he made. Now enjoy the rest of the show it all a bunch of hot air.Best podcast Joe has ever had with a commieYou would have to pass legislation lol in other words you would use the force of the state to air some bozo for 30 mins.Bernie with VP Rogan wins 50 statesLibtards will NOT succeed in taking the American Citizen&#39;s guns.  Period.  OLD man Bernie is INSANE.  A LUNATIC.All the Presidential Candidates should just go on Joe Rogan for 1 hour.I see why people love BernieBernie sells himself well but he’s a politician aka a fucking liar. Don’t believe anything he says or anyone in a political position. Doesn’t matter what party or how reasonable they sound, they are professional liarsInfomercial for Bernietrillions in free college mean while super heavily in debt and college in 2019 is worse than ever...bad idea...... ai and robots going to take lots of jobs in next 10 years and college wont help..... if you pay to learn you learn way better.... just a big society burden for the ultra elite to collapse economy like they always do..Free education is one thing, a &quot;progressive&quot; education is quite another. Education today is not too dissimilar to a Marxist  indoctrination.Bernie Sandernista!  Being serious here...based on Trump&#39;s victory, and all the mass shootings, you&#39;re gonna have to bring the fire!  People are beyond fury, and there&#39;s blood in the water.  Just saying you have got to get louder and tell it how it is, including burying the dnc.  Regardless, I know it falls on deaf ears but people want a fighter and I&#39;m not sure you fit the bill...you have to take victory, it doesn&#39;t fall into your lap.   Voted for Trump, and M.Moore was right, it was our way of telling the system to go fzck itself.  Things haven&#39;t changed, and with normal people....things keep getting tougher.  But I&#39;ll say this...take the gloves off, not for yourself necessarily, but for the people... deregulate the average guy...let the little people retaliate against the people who fzck everything up!  (No Antifa... You&#39;re not invited to the uprising)Supported Bernie in 2016, but he backed down to BLM activists and to Hillary Clinton when it was well documented that he was cheated by the DNC.  That was such a slap in the face to all who donated and went to his rallies, etc.  <br /><br />In hindsight I’m grateful that Trump won.Concessions? Sounding more and more like a socialist dictator every minuteBernie 2020!!!Sure. If we are able to afford it try to improve the healthcare system. However it wont work without a secured border and immigration control. If I remember right Bernie raised his hand when asked if his healthcare plan would include illegal immigrants.😂😂😂Thanks for the interview Joe. I pray Bernie gets the nomination.<br />KEEP AMERICA GREAT!<br />TRUMP 2020!!!Bernie / Yang 2020I agree with basically everything he said besides banning &quot;assault weapons&quot; but I would be willing to give up my AR-15 as long as he would do all of the other stuff first just to prove he&#39;s not bullshiting like Trump did with the &quot;repeal Obama care&quot; horse shit I supported Trump for awhile but he&#39;s just part of the &quot;swamp&quot; he promised to get rid of my first ever vote at 30 years old will go to Berniewe are witnessing first hand a revolution in unmediated politics and news media. Just as Joe and Jordan Peterson were discussing in a previous podcast, television and radio news coverage is a dying medium saturated with lies and omissions. We are so fortunate,  to have access to this. This is really unfettered information. I think Bernie discounted and obfuscated the answer to Joes assertion that legalizing drugs will have a net benefit to society. Bernie is probably thinking the older voters with retrograde feelings towards drugs will not support bernie if he sides with this. Hell probably bernie is one of the old people with retrograde thoughts towards drugs. I think it will be fantastic for the very reasons Joe submitted.“I talked to a lady.. last night...”99.9% of gun owners are responsible. My close male friend, a responsible gun owner, used his gun on Himself in a moment of extreme despair. He took many hearts with him in that one moment with that gun.EwwI’m a conservative and do not support Bernie, but I truly appreciate that he had a platform to discuss his ideas and policies. We need more civil conversations like this in America.Bummer. I wanted to know about Bernie.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23feelthebern">#feelthebern</a>Bernie “I’ll never forget what she said” SandersBernie trying to get us to the Star Trek future instead of Star Wars, bless him.&quot;You need to be working with people from ALL WALKS OF LIFE.&quot;FUCK YOU TRINTELLIX.

I am more than surprised.Now I DEFIANTLY WANT BERNIE to win so he can return and spill the beans on extraterrestrial life💀👽👾👻👀!!!!!!!!!In Canada that heart surgery may cost zero, but you will be on a six month waiting list to get it.He won&#39;t crack down on the corporations not paying taxes with offshore accounts in fucking bermuda, that own him and his campaign and every other politician... But he will take money from hard working people who earn their money. The 1% owning 99% of the wealth is not a myth and wealth does need to be spread out but spreading out the millionaires money without spreading out the billionaires money just will not happen. Taking money from millionaires is putting a bandaid on a gun shot wound same with all of his other plansBernie sanders is in the 1%!!!!!!!!!!!  Give up your money then talk you hypocritical prickI get that Joe was just letting him talk but there was so much crap that Joe would have called a regular person out on that he let Bernie get away with.I lean left, but c’mon Bernie the US wasn’t fighting China in WWII 😂Listen...I’m sorry but the fact is the larger the gap is between the have and the have nots, the more our whole system starts to fall apart.Joe cmon dude... You let this guy just lie. Every time it comes to raising taxes... Or paying minimum wages of $15... He uses Disney, Amazon as examples. THATS CRAZY! <br /><br />Conservatives are worried about small business owners. <br /><br />Wall Street BY FAR is all in with Democrat party. Jeff Bezos is Dem. Mark Cuban is Dem. Soros, Steyer, Reiner Dems. If the famous Cocke brothers supporting Dems in 2020 and not GOP. Clinton was on the board at Walmart. What bout China? By far most important thing Trump is doing that Bernie would never do.  <br /><br />As for Healthcare, to compare the numbers, even per capita between America &amp; Canada is CRAZY!<br /><br />Americans ARE WAYYYY UNHEALTHIER than Canadians.<br /><br />To say that Trumps tax cuts benefited 83% to the top wealthiest people... OBVIOUSLY BC THEY HAVE SO MUCH MORE MONEY. <br /><br />BUT we had to incentivize businesses to bring jobs back to this country. <br /><br />If these God Damn Dems are such economic geniuses... WHY WAS ECONOMY THE WORST IN HISTORY UNDER OBAMA...<br /><br />To make it seem like college tuitions are “too high”... YEAH, BC DEMOCRATS guaranteed college loans!<br /><br />What’s fucked up about that... These colleges are run 110% by these liberal socialists that are all about “fairness” and “equality”.... THEN HOW IS IT THAT IF THERE ARE NO CONSERVATIVES RUNNING ADMINS AT MAJORITY OF THE COLLEGES... REPUBLICANS ARE THE GREEDY ONES... YET LOOK AT THE PRICE FOR COLLEGE TUITION!<br /><br />Maxine Waters, that clown, got all the big banks in front of her committee, financial committee... And she starts grilling them asking what are they goin to do to help with college loans... UNTIL THE LAST PERSON TOLD HER THAT THEY CANT DO SHIT BC THE GOVERNMENT TOOK OVER THE COLLEGE LOANS INDUSTRY!!!! <br /><br />And I’m sorry but one last thing... This man to sit there and say that Medicare is somehow so great... MEDICARE ONLY COVERS 40% OF THE COSTS FOR MEDICARE... What happens when we are all on it? Who covers that 60% then?<br /><br />These elites want to implement socialism and they put a patsy like Sanders out there bc it’s hard not to like the man and see that in his heart he’s sincere. <br /><br />BUT BY THE END OF HIS PRESIDENCY... THE GOV WOULDVE TAKEN OVER ALL INDUSTRIES... UNDERSTAND IF THIS MAN OR ANY DEMOCRAT WINS... THESE LEFT WING PSYCHOS TALKING ABOUT TAXING US TO PAY FOR ILLEGALS HEALTHCARE... THESE ARE GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE RUNNING HIS ADMINISTRATION! <br /><br />BUT THE END OF HIS REIGN, WE WILL ALL BE SO STARVED, OUR FREE SPEECH WILL BE SILENCED (JUST LIKE IF CLINTON WON, NO ONE WOULD BE EVEN ATTEMPTING TO TAKE ON BIG TECH COMPANIES (WHICH IS A LOT HARDER THAN ANYONE COULD IMAGINE BC ITS OBVIOUS THEY ARE ALL IN BED WITH THE SOROS, INTEL AGENCIES, STATE DEPT, ETC!Nothing but Pure Respect for Bernie Sanders. DNC played him wrong last time, and gave the greatest nation in history to the hands of one of the worst leaders ever! wish Bernie the best, he deserves a shot at this more than anyone else!Out of the 330:00 deaths by guns a year statistic only around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m00s">4:00</a> of those deaths are by rifles of any kind and only about 50 or less from &quot;assault rifles&quot;crook why the hell would we put our government in control of our funds. they are in debt how much.... smhThis old man thinks agenda is agenderPolitics are BS. Learn engineering!I like how the top comments are only of people supporting this crazy mans ideology. Let’s see all the comments in chronological order.whats with all the dislikes?I JUST CANT TAKE THIS GUY SERIOUSLY... the fact that Medicare and IHS and VA PAYS the Price of medications is why they are so high... if all state medical programs stopped paying for those drugs for ONE week drug companies would be ON THEIR KNEES... but the answer is to let the federal government pay MORE of their bills...  <br />If you thing the government should be in charge of your health care look what they have done to the gas can in the last 15 years.Modern sporting rifles were not banned in 1994. Features of them were, and crime shot up hard until that &quot;ban&quot; ended. Since then, violent crime in America has been on a downward trend and rifles account for less death per year in America than toaster-ovens worldwide. +/- 400 per year. More people are murdered by hammers and sticks and other blunt inanimate objects wielded by the mentally inept. We should focus on mental health and the over-prescription of psych meds by big pharma as well as fatherless homes, as most recent mass-shooters suffered from both.minimum wage doesn&#39;t work, if you don&#39;t want big pharma to do whatever they want you have to allow generica (free market), and bernie seems odd to not know this (I consider him not stupid, so he has to know it and is therefor a lying fucking dick)Thank you Joe, this was greatIf I were a scientist, I&#39;d like to do an experiment simulating the wealth discrepancy in america but using mice as the &quot;americans&quot; and food as the &quot;wealth&quot; and protective barriers to enforce the discrepancies between the different &quot;classes&quot; of mice....maybe make it in a pyramid structure.....idk......top of the pyramid........... .1% of mice.........more than ample food.....layer underneath, 1% of mice , ample food, but not nearly the same amount as tier above.........tier underneath, 10% of mice, .....ample food.....but still, not nearly the same amount of food as the tiers above(especially compared per capita)............tier underneath, 10% of mice.....still , ample food......but drastically less per capita...........tier underneath..........40% of mice..........food drastically reduced(per capita).....definite scarcity at this tier........tier underneath................38.9% of mice........food drastically reduced (even compared to the tier above to the point where....there definitely is not enough food to go around.....what would we see happen, within that experiment unfolding? idkso fuckin woke rnYour so called &quot;assault weapons&quot; you fucking old dunce is not different from a regular fuckin pistol you stupid fuck, I&#39;m so sick of hearing that bullshit.At least when Bernie loses, he gets to go home to his 3 million $, his car collection and specialized, tax payer paid for health insurance.I think I speak for everybody when I say: Sanders is a cuck.Yoooooooo, did not expect this one 😅Bernie &quot;I say the made up term Assault weapon, along with every other talking head democunt, like it means something&quot; Sanders <br /><br />Boogaloo 2020civil discourse ho! this was awesomeMAGA 2020the republican party is a white identity politics party.  bernie is the only candidate for the working man&quot;In other countries&quot; ..........Is Noam going on here soon?What a great interview.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotMeUs">#NotMeUs</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23IWroteTheDamnBill">#IWroteTheDamnBill</a> 🔥Bernie Sanders!!!!!!!! Hell ya let’s gOoOoOooo!!!H o l y shit! Big swing by the Sanders camp here. I&#39;m anxious to see if this turns into a shit show!Next president of the United States of America!!! Oh and say goodbye to all businesses. Except for the local bodega.When are you getting Obamayou can commit an &quot;assault&quot; with any weapon therefore making it an assualt weapon, is a knife an assault weapon? a pistol? an ar 15? how can you call for a ban on &quot;assault rifles&quot; when you can barely define the concept. i agree with more backgrounds and rules for guns in general but getting rid of them is simply not the answer, in areas with less legal weapons there is more crime.if you ban any guns people will still maufacture them illegally...how do you think meth gets on the street? thats highly illegalExcellent podcast. Glad to see Bernie have the time to pose and explain his plan. This man could help the whole world!Joe Rogan 2020.I like what he’s proposing. I hope he get elected. I will say I wish he could’ve talked about other issues. 1 hour is not enough time to talk about all the issues plaguing this country.Get Trump on the podcast lolWhat the fuck Bernie, nobody gives a shit that you crossed the boarder and got insulin from Canada for 1/10 of what you say it costs here. <br />First, if healthcare in canada is free, why would they be paying for insulin there anyway?<br />It&#39;s also cheaper if you buy a cheaper brand.<br />Canadians are forced to wait in line for health care, &amp; have to come to US in order to not have to wait.<br /><br />How in the fuck do you think that Doctor&#39;s &amp; surgeons are just gonna be ok with making less money?<br />Because you force them? No.Bernie is the only person who consistently had the same views for years .  Bernie is the only real candidate in the race,  Not me Us. The 11k dislikes are probably Hillbots, and MAGA losers. And Joe Biden HacksThe day they quit going live, I started thinking he was going to have some heavy hitter political ppl on. Standby for trumpTRUMP STILL GUNNA BE YOUR PRESIDENT TILL 2024 ! <br />AMERICANS FIRST ! BUILD THE WALL.DEPORT THEM ALL! <br />BAN THE MOOSLUMS! <br />1776!   2A SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED!How do we or can we change the rules so that the giant corporations pay taxes?  What is going to take to save the middle class? I heard a lot of pie in the sky talk. But the fact is, if politicians make the laws and laws are made to benefit the people that buy them off,  how can we make any real changes? We need money coming into the system and we cannot take it from those that can least afford it.More people in jail than China admits to... Because &quot;re-education&quot; is totally just voluntary schoolingLet’s not all forget , An mma bro is the only guy  getting real conversations out of the nations most  important people .  I salute you Joe.Have to upvote this despite auto voting for Trump. Joe amazes with the diversity of guests.We need reform of campaign finances.<br />Corruption needs to be made illegal.<br />International companies that have bigger budgets than most countries cannot be controlled by a government.  We need ant-trust laws.  And break up cartels and monopolies.  Monopolies stifle innovation.<br />College tuition is so high since we have unforgivable student loans.  They get their tuition even though they might not get a job.  Its guaranteed money.  It&#39;s a scam.This is what should be done Joe. Have a conversation with people when they have a difference of an opinion. We need to talk these things out and iron it out face to face instead of using censorship and lies from the media. Not a big Bernie fan, but I enjoyed this small debate and I feel that there should be more of them. That way we can see what they&#39;re all about or if they&#39;re all just full of shit like the rest of them.anyone know how we can refer guests to rogan?Just when i think im out Joe goes and has a guest like Bernie Sanders on the show and PULLS ME BACK IN AGAIN!! Good job Joe and for all you americans out there, please VOTE FOR SANDERS!!!!! We need a REAL CHANGE in the White House.This Bernie Guy is a Tool of Globalism that is DEAD..  He is a Stooge of the New World Order.  A King George III Weirdo.  Bring in Communism to save the UN and EU...  WOW..  Complete bulshit tool of the Satan agenda..  No Thanks Nobody Bernie..  What a Freak ..  God Bless America and Thank Jesus that we have Trump 2020!Let’s not look past the fact that Bernie Slanders IS IN “THE EVIL 1% !!!!!” - further consider how this is all paid for = TAXES! Your, our taxes....Joe could have made bernie elaborate more on his perspectives a little more such as minimum wage. Really let him slide on that without giving a real answer to why it wouldn&#39;t be a negative to our economy.Every candidate should have a mandatory 1 1/2 hour episode with Joe. If not, you’re not taken seriously.Ron Paul???Comrade Bernie 😂 he has no answers... trash can politics... he was owned by ted Cruz, and he is dumb ass was given a lot of time in that debatehe dosent even know the federal minimum wageBernie Sanders as president is what the U.S needs, it’s what the world needs. People over profit, peace over wars. Do everything you can to help him win.the &quot;this year has been hot&quot; argument was used last year by conservatives citing the opposite outcome (colder summer than usual) therefore climate change isn&#39;t real - and scientists came down like a meteorite saying it&#39;s about the longterm analysis.<br />this year, we&#39;ve had very hot peaks, and NOW the short term suddenly matters. &quot;look at that one day in france! climate change is real, see?&quot;<br />stop doing this bad faith double-standards shit. you are only undermining your point just like the climate disaster prediction of the 80&#39;s over-dramatized the results and it ended up in less trust overall once the 00&#39;s came about and all the glaciers did not melt as predicted. fucking fuck off with your tactics, how about you use the truth tactic for once in your lifetime, you partizan retards, can&#39;t you see the pattern in how this only makes the other side stronger by giving them valid points to dismantle your bullshit which in turn results to a permanent stall?<br />jesus christ, all politicians are the same. braindead pieces of shit. STOP BEING ROBOTS. BE PEOPLE.Bernie Sanders is the worst possible candidate for the 2020 election. Most of his &quot;&quot; gun knowledge is not even true. Just a year ago he did know the difference between a clip and a magazine and he also seems to not understand that pistols kill people much more quickly much more commonly and much more efficiently than the assault rifles&quot;&quot;My favorite part of this podcast was when joe and Bernie discussed the health benefits of eating Elk that you hunted yourselfI like how he talks about rural white communities!Hide your wallets.I&#39;m so proud of joe rogan.Bernie doesn&#39;t hide the ball, I like thatFantastic Interview!Healthcare for all. We knew it didn’t work when Obama had those ex-Google t-shirt wearin’ dudes fumble up the website on the rollout. And we know it nowDid Joe test Bernie on any issue/ policy?  If so what? Or is this just a long form campaign ad.Ya all white guys are mentally unstable :DFccckkkk trumppIt’s still Trump 2020!I also love how joe asked him about the failed prohibition  policy on  illicit drugs that fund cartels , which btw fueled the American Mafia , and he reframed the question.  I do like how he wants to be tough on the pharmaceutical companies though.  I don’t dislike the guy I just don’t think  he’s strong or different enough🔥🔥🔥🔥BERNIE 2020🔥🔥🔥🔥Joe- When are you going to have Laura Loomer on as a guest??Voting Trump again, but I&#39;m glad to hear from good ole&#39; Grandpa Bernie. I actually like him as a person compared to a lot of the Dems, especially Hillary or Harris aka tan Hillary. Bernie, Tulsi and Yang actually seen like decent people even if I disagree with 90% of their solutions. Thanks Joe!Though I love long form interviews, I’m not a huge fan of the softball questions that let him rant without any critical thinking. It felt like Bernie fed the questions to Joe beforehand with the condition that Joe couldn’t ask anything that could make Bernie look bad. At least he wasn’t yelling with his hands above his head to get attention this time!Joe should get Tucker Carlson onCan you imagine calling out the most powerful men in the world all in one video? What a badass.I am a middle-rght conservative. ( I guess these days middle) I believe in capitalism;  wholeheartedly. I do not agree with Bezos/Amazon getting a handout on tax cuts or pooling $$$ overseas. I like Bern-dog as a person, and also his crackdown on greed. What I don&#39;t like is: he doesn&#39;t have an answer to his &#39;plan&#39;. AND yes, a doctor will be 300k in dept out of school, but guess what, they also make 110-125k a year out of school...  I also think anyone that has student debt should pay ZERO dollars in interest up to 5 years. After that, yes, interest applies. Everyone outta school before 5 years needs time to get their feet wet, and make $$$! Let&#39;s discuss before we take jabs at each other to!I havent seen one &quot;Joe &#39;something&#39; Rogan&quot; joke yet.lame and boring.Yasss! Dad is finally on this show!!!He will be the best President, he&#39;s the only one I trust. Has my vote. Even if he ends up as a 3rd candidate, I will even use the write-in section (that no one ever talks about 🤔) to write his name in if I have to.I am 50 minutes in and have been struggling to not shut it off for 40!Joe “will be bigger than Howard Stern” Roganvery impressed with bernie. I see him in a new light now.Did anyone see the Vertex bow commercial where the guy said &quot;We targeted the hunter&quot;?If you are against corruption, Sanders is the best choice!You should have J. Cole on the Show man.Mr I own 4 mansions, but hate rich people Bernie SandersI like him; but you guys do know Bernie is the 1% he keeps talking about. He rich AF!!!Trump 2020!!! KAGA <br />Don&#39;t let these Wizards pplay with your emotions. THINK don&#39;t FEEL.....Use logic and do research from all opinions and you folks will generally do well in life.if Bernie becomes President then announces aliens are real on this podcast that will be the single greatest moment in the history of mankindWhy doesnt bernie talk about the fact that these shootings just so happen to take place at a time when a global pedophilia ring was the major story across the country and in one weekend its completely forgot about and we are back in 1997 arguing about gun control as if it were columbine all over again. These attacks are getting old and we need to recognize the real story that is being disguised by the violence.Do something like educate people on unstable behavior and who to go for help, for them. Think of a way to cut down on the source of the problem directly with the help of those(possible x gf) who notice behavior like that.Great conversation, more of this could help out this crazy world.<br /><br />Wrong to instantly dislike the video because of preconceived notions. <br /><br />Some people just want to watch the world bern.Bernie “Everything needs to be taxed” SandersTeachers are working 3 or 4 jobs? Where does he get these stats?Dislikes: Toxic humanity willing to destroy themselves.<br /><br />Likes: Humanity willing to recognize the problems, be aware, and try and help each other.Bernie &quot;Don&#39;t Hold Me To This&quot; SandersI look forward to President Trump coming on in the lead up to 2020!Joe, you interview them all. Not feeling the bern but.. to each their own.Alriiight Joe!!Im voting for Bernie but man this was kind of a let down. I was hoping he would get deeper into how he plans to implement his policies. I guess Politicians are all the same in that regard. :/If the raid on Area 51 fails Bernie certainly won’t !!!Get Donald Trump on nextWhaaaaatYup, Bernie just cemented my decision to not vote for the DNC.What does raising the minimum wage do for living costs including house prices- it will force prices up across the board negating any rise in minimum wage!!!!!! <br />How can these socialists be so Thick????Is Bernie gonna hit the blunt or whatBernie 2020, we can do this!Some are saying hes stealing some of yangs ideas/statements say it aint so?Really food interview Joe thank you. I may not be a Bernie guy but I want to hear all sides. Thanks👏🏼 minimum wage 👏🏼 only hurts 👏🏼 small business 👏🏼 not  👏🏼 corporationsWhen are you going to have Trump on?!?!?!? Please!!!!All the dislikes from the Americans who are blinded by a blindfold they put on themselves.Why do i have this fkd up sad 😞 feeling that Bernie is gonna end up bein the nex JFK 🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️I still don&#39;t like Bernie but it was so nice to see two people have a civil conversation. Well done Joe.Dude is old AFJoe got Bernie for an hour, dope!Millyonays and Billyonays!!If you are enjoying this podcast you should see the Andrew Yang episode, it is just so good. If you already like Bernie and think he does great in long format, you owe it yourself to check out Andrew Yang to get greater insight into his vast collection of policies and why they make more sense than Bernie&#39;s free college, $15 minimum wage, and retraining/jobs programs. He wants to solve the problems we care about, but ditches what did not and will not work for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8">https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8</a>I&#39;m on Bernie&#39;s level, my proposal for the world: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/comments/bohat2/ubi_is_a_bandaid/">https://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/comments/bohat2/ubi_is_a_bandaid/</a>Wow! As pro2a joe is he sure let Bernie tell a bunch of lies. Come the fuck on.Sorry but Bernie does not stand for freedom. He stands for an economic system that had never been successful.Rogan has jumped the shark. Having a socialist millionaire who&#39;s never worked a day in his life telling everyone how bad they have it. The insanity it takes to believe this guy is profound.Why was Kennedy killed?<br /><br />He was too good at his job. Listen to his Madison Square Garden health care speech, his American University speech, or his last address to the United Nations. He wanted peace. He wanted to use the wealth and influence of the US to benefit the American people and make the world better, safer and more just. But the last thing the ruling elite wanted was another FDR type President investing into American society, so they had him killed.<br /><br />What happened next? Vietnam, escalation of the cold war and the rise of the neoliberal economic system; all of which sucked wealth away from the American people, leaving us desperate, confused and angry.<br /><br />Sanders seems to know the enemy he&#39;s facing, aside from policy, that&#39;s enough to get my vote. We should be so lucky as to have a politician of his moral character; we may never see it again.A good idea isn&#39;t a good idea based off of how many people support it or not.. lol&quot;Diseases of Despair &quot;No matter what this guy says you have to remember he sold out ! He’ll do it again! They don’t call him Bernie Sandenistas for nothing!<br /><br />He’s been in Congress for how long? And for all his ideas, what has he ever accomplished that helped the country?!?Bernie the fraud, what a joke<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m33s">1:04:33</a> I didn&#39;t know we went to war with the Chinese in 41&#39; thanks for the knowledge big BernHaha, well the first minute is totally awesome!God an hour of listening to his bullshit my ears were bleeding🔥🔥🔥Thank you for having bernie on. I dont like em but it&#39;s nice to hear an hour of his bullshit open ended answers. Helps me solidify my decisions😊How dems can prefer this guy over Andrew yang is mind blowing to me.  He is clearly more of the same .  He’s not that sharp.  Oh well.You know if I lived next to many countries with drug cartels and human traffickers I would not want to give away my rights to bare arms.<br />I live in Australia but we are an island that is hard to access and is a whole different context. The gun violence is probably a cause of poverty, bad mental health and a lack of purpose in life. Get the people jobs, have them be able to own a home and their own cars and see if they will commit these heinous crimes.<br /><br /><br />This is just my two cents in the debate.Softball questions. Student debt- let the schools be vested in the problem, useless majors, and young people taking * the cash* portion being used by students to buy shit. Universal health care- government  pays only 80% of total bill, without a third party provider , i.e. insurance , 35% of hospitals would have to close. Minimum wage-  puts small business owners under financial downfall, plus it stymies the free market . And more.........Great interview Joe! So much better than the mainstream media&#39;s Q and A.checked out at 22 min. this is the dumbest thing i have ever seenthe right wing audience of Joe getting triggered in the like/dislike bar it seems.Only see this to see if he inhaleI&#39;m not sure where Burnie gets the idea that more bureaucracy is the solution to problems caused by the government. Healthcare doesn&#39;t grow on trees people labor to provide those services. Your rights do not include anyone&#39;s labor. Things like minimum wage make it illegal to hire low skill workers. The work is just outsourced to other countries or taken up by illegal immigrants. Thus these low skill workers cannot gain the skills needed to earn a higher wage. Money doesn&#39;t have inherent value it&#39;s just a median of exchange tied to labor. Taxing capital gains sounds like a way to ensure that almost nobody wants to invest since the odds that they lose money is now more than before which is already a risk. Most of the opioid problem is not prescription even though it may start that way. Street drugs are cheaper and even if legalized unless it&#39;s not taxed/regulated they always will be; drug addicts tend to be short on cash. Great interview as always.Let everyone grow there own weed. Death penalty for those who sold drugs that kill the end user.Joe!!!!! <br /><br />Get Bernie Sanders and Thomas Sowell on the show at the same time.  <br /><br />Sanders is an idiot.I’d love to see Dan Crenshaw on the podcast, anyone else feel the same??BERNIE SUCKSBuying a gun or dozens of guns and selling them to criminals is against the law. <br />Buying a gun at the gun show you’re supposed to get a background check. If they don’t then they’re breaking the law. Adding the same law onto the existing law doesn’t make the law any betterSo much slave in the comment raise to hate socialism/help you re american brother instead they prefer to venerate their billionaire master. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23brainwash">#brainwash</a> is strong in america. Also bernie fight the REAL money and power people. People who say he is rich so hypocrite just want to divide people as their master want it to be.<br /><br />When you divide poor man/women, black/white, gay/straight, they fight each other and not the real enemy.... they re commun masters. <br /><br />Media and a lot of « conservative » push that agenda all the time.If the intent was to just give Bernie time to give his take on issues and what he would do if elected, great job Joe. Now when he’s saying government is going to build up neighborhoods, put people back to work, blah blah blah, can anyone ask real fucking questions about paying for this cotton candy unicorn world Bernie just described?  At least Bernie said he didn’t vote for NAFTA, which absolutely killed our country.......thank Clinton and the Democrats. Just waiting for some real questions to bring Bernie back to earth, you know, like “so you’re plan is to have teachers not let kids drop out, make China and Russia stop polluting and go green, so let me ask you Bernie, what’s your favorite color? WTF?!!this is bizarre. i’m talking to a girl currently who wants me to dirty talk but i’m way more into this then her.I’m voting for Bernie Sanders in 2020 because I gots to see dem aliensThe truth. Vote BernieScrew this guy. Fucking socialist.He talks about wanting to re-establish hope and optimism in people.  I love it.Wow. I remember when they were running that commercial about Bernie. I&#39;m all about a president focusing on our own nation&#39;s problems that he discussed.Man- I disagree with just about everything Bernie is saying. But it&#39;s so much better to hear him lay it out instead of shouting to get heard. Hopefully something like this becomes the standard and the &#39;debates&#39; on MSM go the way of the dodo.The last question😂 perfect way to close the podcast🙌🏻one hour?😑 really😑Bernie 2020.Bernie&#39;s first line is quoting Andrew Yang.Pete next! Awesome interview!when Rogan&#39;s passion for marijuana comes outI love this. . .and a full hour?!?You mean an &quot;assault weapon&quot; like a knife?  Or a &quot;military style&quot; gun like a Winchester Model 12 shotgun right?  Okay good, for a second there it sounded like the gun talk was complete bullshit.Bernie is wrong about the minimum wage demographics &quot;Minimum wage workers tend to be young. Although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less. Among employed teenagers (ages 16 to 19) paid by the hour, about 8 percent earned the minimum wage or less, compared with about 1 percent of workers age 25 and older.&quot; - Bureau of Labor StatisticsNow on the subject of drugs.. marijuana. You trying to hit this shit Bernie?I have to say it is a cop-out on Bernie&#39;s behalf to say oh its happening in every other country yet ignoring that America is the strongest...and thats not just me being a proud American, we are not other countries...we are The United States!I want less taxes for everybody.I wonder if Bernie can explain how he ended up  living  in a basement at age 41 without electricity in spite of spending his parents money to graduate from the U of ChicagoLook, I&#39;m not right or left, I like Bernie and he&#39;s a smart guy but I&#39;m a dual citizen from canada and the healthcare system is extremely flawed. It&#39;s way worse than you can imagine and the taxes where I lived were higher than anywhere in north america. I could pay double that I pay for health benefits currently and still take home more money than I made in Canada. Paying for benefits is cheaper than paying the ridiculous ammount of taxes. The healthcare system will never be perfect but if it&#39;s government controlled the only answer that they will give you is that &quot;there isn&#39;t enough money&quot; so they will continue to raise taxes forever and there won&#39;t be anything to show for it. Ask 90% of Canadians and they will not tell you about &quot;the great free system&quot; the way democratic politicians paint Canadian healthcare as.if big things like corporations, millionaires  are bad expect government?Well Bernie is either a blatant liar or a complete idiot!I really wish you would have got into question about infrastructurethe people doing the shootings arnt the gun OWNER tho.Good interview but...didn&#39;t he cut his staffs hours after raising them to 15$ any hour.&quot;When you talk to the people at Amazon that got that raise, they&#39;re not kids, these are people in their 30s, these are ordinary adults&quot;<br />How long after the raise was he fired and replaced with a robot? How out of touch is bernie lol...<br />These companies are happy to set a minimum wage for their workers now because they&#39;re replacing all of them with automation...When he says ban  assault weapons what he means is ban semi-automatics and by semi automatic he means a gun that fires one bullet per pull of the trigger you know how many guns with fall under that term? You really think you&#39;re going to make hundreds of millions of guns disappear and a third of the US is just going to hand them over? You would have to be a madman.Bernie needs to smoke some WEED right nowFuck jeff bezos.Do you trust the <b>thumbs up</b> &amp; <b>thumbs down</b> statistics for this video?EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT SOCIALISM: PLEASE READ: The thing you have to understand is the difference between CORPORATISM and CAPITALISM. Corporatism is the collusion between government and big business to the financial benefit of huge corporations and banks. This is exactly what we have now. This creates (along with fiat currency) the wealth gap, unfair wages, poverty etc. All this is inequality is now blamed on Capitalism. The reason is thus: Blaming the unfairness of Corporatism on Capitalism is part of a Problem, Reaction, Solution scenario. For thousands of years the ruling class has tricked us into supporting wars and giving up our rights for &quot;safety&quot; in this manner. First they create the PROBLEM, then they wait for you to have a REACTION, and then they provide the SOLUTION for the problem they created in the first place. Claiming that Socialism is the solution for unfairness is precisely a Problem, Reaction, Solution scenario. Please do not fall for it! For a lot more info on dangers of Socialism and it&#39;s parent, COMMUNISM, please watch the series that Edge of Wonder did on it on their youtube channel. Also, please do not confuse necessary social programs with socialism. Social funding for roads and the like is not Socialism. More info on how successful socialism is, please look to Venezuela. Also, the nordic countries often cited for being socialist are not! Please get your facts straight. We need a stable, resourced backed currency and to abolish the Federal Reserve and the insane amount of interest they charge us. We need to stop Corporatism, not run blindly towards socialism. Thank you for reading this.Don’t agree with Bernie Sanders on a lot besides anti-corporatism but I appreciate this long form interview a lot. I’d take Joe Rogan and presidential candidates over debates where nothing gets accomplished any day. Still voting Trump but it definitely made me see where people are coming from when they say they’re voting for Bernie. I just hope there’s a return to civility in politics and society as a whole, there’s too much malice in today’s world. Joe Rogan makes me see that in people.You don&#39;t have to yell Bernie.. .lol yes you do.I can’t sense the evil on Bernie like I can with the others in politics. He’s cool with meThis is YUGEGive him the Bern!Trump 2020 Biden will get the nomination and Trump will destroy him. I&#39;m sorry Bernie you are just not good enoughHealth care is not a human right. It&#39;s a fucking service. If I&#39;m a doctor I have skills that I learned and laid to get. I dont have to serve you a fucking thing. Go ahead and make health care free, see how shitty it will become. It&#39;s not as simple as this fuck face put it, and it IS a radical idea. Stupid liberals.You should get Richard Wolfe on herethat last and most important of fucking questions.. joe.. hahahaha ...  pretty plz w cherries <br />on top ... hahahThis is the first time I listened to a candidate talk deeply about the issues the are facing the USA. We need more of this!!!I love being able to hear what the candidates have to say without the &quot;theater&quot; of the MSM. Bravo! This is the first time I have gotten to hear Sanders talk without interruption. I would like to hear more as well from the other candidates (from both sides) then make my choice.Love Joe, but this should not be a standard of difficult questions for a president. I would like to see Bernie talk to someone who doesn’t agree with himI’m a trump fan and I’m 15 minutes I’m and I agree with everything Bernie has said so far, I just can’t vote for someone who demonizes white people and plays identity politics. What’s a shameGod yes!!!!!!!!!What a stuck up stupid fuck!!! He needs to just die already!If Bernie owned 3 less houses he would be taken more seriously.This is the way politicking is to be done-with respect!Joe, get Don on the podcast. I’d be interested in what you could get out of him.You do not get any doctor you want in Canada. Also the wait times here for stuff is atrocious. Some people waiting 8 months for serious surgeries. Its free ya but you might die waiting to get that care. Stop spouting falsehoods Bernie because you live 15 miles from Canada.Joe I&#39;m glad all the dum dums in your audience have the opportunity to hear this man. Great interview.&quot;Joe.. IT IS LEGAL BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS!!!&quot; lmaoBoooooooorrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnggAll these dislikes, but honestly this was an excellent interview. It&#39;s nice to see a side of Bernie that you won&#39;t see in the mediaI&#39;m a Type 1 Diabetic and I require insulin. The amount big pharma charges for insulin is ridiculous and this is coming from someone who leans more towards conservative. I take Admelog (short-acting insulin) before every meal, and Basaglar (long-acting insulin) once a day. I asked my pharmacist for shits and giggles how much do you guys charge my insurance for these medications? I almost shit my pants to find out for a little 10mL vial is $300/month. And the long-acting Basaglar is $350/mo for a pack of 5 pens. This is already an inflated $650/mo. expense and this doesn&#39;t even include diabetic test strips which are another $60/mo and then factor in insulin pens, lancets, etc.. I mean, you&#39;re talking almost a $1,000/mo just to get medication to live. I agree with Bernie that healthcare IS NOT A PRIVILEGE. It&#39;s a FUNDAMENTAL human right. No one deserves to die because big pharma wants to take advantage of the sick and inflate prices for a profit.I&#39;d like to know what small businesses will look like paying $15 an hour. Amazon and Disney are huge and can afford to do so. What about the little guy you are trying to fight for?BERNIE 2020 <br /><br />HE IS SMART AND HAS GOOD INTENTIONSGet Trump on here.ITS HAPPENINGBernie is great, but he’s making me want to clear my throatAll these comments supporting this Loon. Had no idea all of Rogans viewers were idiot socialist supporters.Fvck This Cocksucka.  MAGA 2020Climate change dogma alone is enough to give Bernie a pass from ever getting the presidency. Too many bad ideas, too much of a &quot;burn&quot;.Mr. Sanders genuinely wants good, I like that.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=45m25s">45:25</a>  &quot;marijuana is obviously a big issue in this country&quot;  LOL  oh, joe...<br /><br />cannabis is not a big issue, obviously.  if you want to say that the war on drugs is a big issue, that&#39;s a little better, but when there are issues like corporate/political corruption (election tampering), atrocious foreign policies (that are inching us closer to nuclear war), and climate change...people being inconvenienced by a law while trying to get high is low on the totem pole.I love Joe Rogan...he’s the reason I got into podcasting. But I’m not a fan of Bernie Sanders. The promises he’s making are, ready for it, impossible without Congress. If you can’t pass these measures what good are you? <br /><br />We are going to give everyone Medicare for all...but in order to do so we have to ABOLISH the private or “for-profit” insurance. How does that help people? Btw No Democrat in (Montana, West Virginia, Missouri, Indiana, South Dakota, North Dakota) red states is going to vote for such nonsense. <br /><br />Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hr isn’t going to pass. There’s Federal Reserve studies, studies by major universities, that show increasing the minimum wage reduces jobs and increases prices. How does that help people?<br /><br />Gun control-has been tried over 22,000 times. During the “Assault Weapons Ban” we had Columbine and the North Hollywood shootings. So clearly it doesn’t work! <br /><br />Sanders doesn’t (as I write today) pay his campaign workers or interns $15 an hour. That’s hypocritical! <br /><br />Marijuana legalization...I’m for it! And expunge and pardon ALL the people with records dealing with drugs (possession, selling, using). <br /><br />Abortion...leave it alone! It’s decided.<br /><br />Taxes...clean up the tax code <br />(9 million+) close loopholes, lower rates, make it efficient and competitive you’ll get more money in the treasury.<br /><br />Pay down the National Debt! It’s more than a $100,000 tax break for all citizens. With a surplus you can build up infrastructure, fund programs, or give it back to the public.We&#39;ve given Trump a shot. <br />Now it&#39;s time to give a real populist and man of the people a proper go at/in the white house. <br />Bernie2020Didn&#39;t talk about UBI?Bernie is a terrible liar. He definitely knows something about aliens.Bernie won’t pay his fair share in taxes and his staff were forced to quit looking for new jobs because he wasn’t paying them a living wage.  Total fraudWE LOVE YOU  JOEGood thing Bernie had 4 hrs (in contrast to the 30 sec sound bites we get with the Dem debates)... to tell us the same broken record shit lolIn the 1950s anyone could purchase a rifle through a catalog without a background check, and nobody was commiting atrocities, today we have more gun laws than ever, yet we have mass atrocities. The truth of the matter is, the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun. Cops are 3 to 5 minutes away, an armed citizen is immediate.HAVE TRUMP ON JOE , ITS ONLY FAIR, LIKE THOSE EUROPEAN NEWS THAT HAVE TO GIVE 30 MINUTES TO CANDIDATESJoe get President Trump on your podcast.Thank your for this &lt;3We should charge big businesses for their fraud and corruption in the past, like XI did in China, so crime doesn&#39;t pay....Senator Bernie &quot;I just talked to someone who...&quot; SandersBernie talking about lobbyists and pay to play politicians yet he endorsed Hilary after the DNC fraud.Let’s get trump on here yahI seriously hate that God damn WGU advertisement 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️FUCK YES! thank you joe this is greatIt&#39;s good to hear Bernie in this format as opposed to him yelling slogans.  He seems so right on power and money in politics - it&#39;s become ridiculous, most of congress is corrupted by this power and money to the detriment of we the people.  The promise of keeping power by campaign contributions, getting a big job after office, etc. is the conduct which screws us over time and time again.<br /><br />I think Bernie is off on the minimum wage - a &quot;living&quot; wage depends on where you live - smaller employers are subject to getting hurt.  All the rhetoric is geared toward the larger corporations. <br /><br />Bernie&#39;s record is consistent, he has done what he says, no double talk.  He has not accomplished a lot in congress, in my opinion, but that is another issue - either it&#39;s not being effective influencing others, or not being able to because the others are mostly bought and paid for and he is not. <br /><br />Look at Andrew Yang&#39;s view on the minimum wage, he&#39;s a very bright guy and it shows in his explanations - he built and sold a business. Bernie knows the corruption and he&#39;s right.  I honestly think he could use some business experience though.<br /><br />I appreciate Joe having Bernie on, he seems right on many overall issues - I have not heard him lay out enough details about how to pay for things or how to deal with the deficit.  No one wants to address the massive deficit.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m20s">23:20</a> OMGDid Bernie mention how much the enough tax will cost me. 22 trillion later it&#39;s still not enoughi feel so deflated when he talks. this isn&#39;t a leaderHow much is Bernie WORTH?...  What a Con ManYou morons act like this podcast isn&#39;t approved by the government. As if some everyday podcast would ever have presidential candidates on it. This is the new mainstream media, just packaged as if it&#39;s against the mainstreamGreat conversation, even though I fervently agree with Bernie it was great to hear a left leaning conversation which didn&#39;t just consist of trump this or trump that (I don&#39;t like trump)AMAZING ....... TNX JOEBernie you are the first to throw baseless insultsCanada and other countries put price limits on medicine, and then Americans end up paying higher prices to make up for it.Hearing this guy talk gives me the Willy’s. Scary shit. He really doesn’t know as much about solving problems as he leads on, and the problem is that since most Americans are ignorant as shit, they believe that he has the answers. Props for having him on, but why aren’t you calling him on some of this shit? “Assault weapons”???? There’s no such thing. Why not press him to define it?Bernie needs to post this to all his social media accounts! Whoever is running his shit is dropping the ball!Unfortunately the world will never be perfect , we just gotta make the best of itDROPPED THE BALL ON THIS ONE JOE!!  Where are the tough questions to his blanket statements???  I’ve literally never seen you let a guest make such claims without digging a little (or even a lot) -  no references or citations of references...   I’m a huge fan but this sounded like you were playing into his campaign and his MARXIST agendas.  Socialism kills... it’s a fact of history. Ask the hard questions that would force truth.Joe needs to interview Trump in a fair manner like he’s interview the dems in a fair manner.WoI don&#39;t dislike Bernie but free health care is NOT as good as paid... Minimum wage increases all prices.. If a burger flipper gets a raise the semi driver bringing burger gets a raise which means factory burger pressers get a raise The store stockers get a raise..... And single parents with children get a raise! That makes NO difference...also guns don&#39;t kill people and pot isn&#39;t bad. I wish more people had common sense and can think for themselves.. Only you live your life! Don&#39;t blame or hope others will change your life... We born alone and die alone so just live it to the best!LOL!&quot;You shouldn&#39;t even call them a debate. What they are is a reality TV show.&quot; Didn&#39;t Andrew Yang say that first?!😂😂😂😂😂😂at the people who think Bernie would be a good President... <br /><br />Argued for increased minimum wage while paying his staffers less then minimum😂<br />Thinks folks who worked hard to earn an above average living should be punished for it and have to give back to folks who dnt want to work, all while he has multiple homes,cars,etc. But makes no mention of himself😂<br />Thinks everything should be FREE! cuz that will surely fix everything😂The mainstream media , social media and left stoke hate and division among races , cultures and classes of people. DIVIDE AND CONQUER is the playbook of these communist.I literally gasped seeing his name. He has to get to them kids one way or another damn it! <b>Old Man Communism Fist Shake</b>Bernie wants free healthcare and $15 for everyone.................unless you work for himSince the billionaires own the government. And they are knowingly killing it&#39;s citizens by the hundreds of thousands each year through greed and manipulation,  maybe keeping the guns in the hands of the citizens is the best way to protect ourselves against a massive big brother who doesn&#39;t have any interest in our well-being .I&#39;m disappointed in Joe, he didn&#39;t call Bernie out on any his bull crap.Can&#39;t watch the interview right now but someone ease tell me, does he tell how he&#39;s going to cure cancer if he becomes president as he claimed at one of his rallies???Am i the only person that thinks the whole education system need to be reformed since it hasnt changed since the industrial revolutionI&#39;m only in under 8 min. Sanders is full of it. WTF,JOE ask about the wait times to see a doc, then go from there to get surgery.  Follow up questions make you a  great host. Also at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m40s">4:40</a> Does not deny he will take your money. True politician,  made it about him and not the question. I bowed out in under 10 minutes. SorryNo waaaaaaaay!The debates should only air on C-SPAN!!!fuck anyone disliking you russian bot bitchWhat&#39;s the price of insulin in Canada compared to, say the price from Walmart in America?how can people not like this guy? lol i can understand not agreeing with him... but cmon he&#39;s sincereThis just arrived in my inbox 30 minutes before bedtime. Time to settle in for a late night &gt;:)Wanna know why drug companies charge so much for drugs? Because developing new drugs is astronomically expensiveHonestly it&#39;s been a minute since I&#39;ve seen anyone younger than 30 working at a restaurant or retail store making minimum wage. But also let&#39;s give Bernie a chance at being president. I think it&#39;ll be interesting to see what he can do. He talks a big game and his passion and ambition to create a positive chance over the last 50 years tells me he has a serious shot at accomplishing everything he&#39;s saying.I saw Joe along side with Dave Chapelle together on stage last Saturday. What a time it was to be alive.that final question was amazingPrivatized healthcare has no incentive to serve rural communities, here&#39;s a reality check, corporations do not own the doctors! Cut those greedy middlemen out like a cancer!thanks to all the non-Bernie supporters who took the time to listen. If you still disagree with the man, I respect that, but at least you gave him a chance.Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard would clearly be the dream team.   Make it happen America!Love Bernie but i have to disagree on minimum wage. Full disclosure, not American but Canadian. We artificially raised our min wage in ontario and living costs have gone through the roof, min jobs now have less hours and those of us who make 10 to 20 percent above minimum don&#39;t get a raise so our buying power is cut. Its just not a fix all.For some reason deep deep down I had a strong feeling...a feeling so strong it could lift the earth it was on a flat surface...wate earth is flat ..that joe Rogan..would ask Burnie Sanders...future POTUS about 👽We need more honest politician like Bernie. His track record speaks for itself. He&#39;s the same dude saying the same things as that young Bernie who got arrested chained to a black woman while protesting for civil rights. Bernie 2020!If we had Star Trek levels of resources I&#39;d be behind a lot of these ideas. Sadly, if they were implemented today there would be an immediate financial collapse, production of goods would decline, value of money would collapse, and we&#39;d end up with a much worse off situation, even if everything was &quot;free&quot;. There&#39;s a lot of corruption in various systems, so I have sympathy for wanting to reform those systems, but when the government takes over, that&#39;s it. If you think a corrupt corporation is bad, you can at least compete against those. Once you have a corrupt government with absolute control over health, defense (guns), education, etc...you&#39;re fucked. There&#39;s no competing, just a boot stamping on a human face for eternity.Rogan: what do you say to the people that say that they have a right to keep their guns to protect against criminals? <br /><br />Bitch you know damn well the 2nd amendment wasn’t put in place to protect against criminals, unless by criminals you mean a tyrannical government. A gun is a form of power, so if you want to take away guns then you literally want to take away power from the people.I would seriously love to see peter theil on the show!Trump next!This episode has the potential to change the world. I was never a Bernie supporter but after watching this I agreed with a lot of what he was saying. Please Joe host a debate episode and mediate the bullshit.FYI: Bernie denied his own campaign workers $15 min wage, but promotes to be enforced for all companies he is a Hypocrite! Lets not forget this guy also allowed the DNC and Hillary to cheat him out of his presidency stood bye let it happen then support the person that orchestrated it. Do you want someone like that to be your president?I really respect Joe for having guests all along the political spectrum and also letting his viewers know about some candidatesYeeeesssss Bernie!!!!! Yeeesss Joe!!  Total turning point in the USA!!!  This man must be elected!!!Watch the stock markets and your 401k go down the drain if he takes office. You can wash that down with a middle class tax increase! The government has never spent our tax dollars efficiently. I don’t think he’s a bad person. I think his policy’s that try to help will ultimately kill our economy.This is a great episode and a nice change of tone, however, nothing can make me vote blue at this point.I absolutely love what JRE is doing. This is what politics needs, this is what America needs, this is what the world needs. A no-time restraint format to completely explain and talk through ideas so we can better understand. This is phenomenal.I’m pretty left but leave the assault rifles...wtf...dude I want the same people that own those to operate those please...and I think EVERYONE should at least KNOW someone that walks in public with a gun...why NOT? Sane people debate...they don’t get angry and gunfight at noon...I don’t own a gun but I should. I mean if I owned one I KNOW I could be a potential source of community protection should shit turn unfortunate...<br /><br />It does make me sad though...he even wants free air time from the networks. 😂I&#39;d just like to point out that Bernie&#39;s example of &quot;free&quot; health care is far from it. with all deductions from my pay I took home just shy of 50% of my earnings.. and also a lot of medications required after procedures are not covered and you STILL pay out of pocket for them... if you are going to use an example for &quot;free&quot; healthcare, do not use Canada. its one of the greatest lies told by our government lolim not a bernie supporter but he the best of all major canidatesI never thought Rogan would bring on Bernie, glad to see it.Get Trump onPhrusher, Real talk I love all of you!This dude is the real life old guy from the muppets .Bernie Sanders is the only truly virtuous presidential candidate, with a serious shot at winning, that I have ever seen in my lifetime.

Can&#39;t tell if this shows how great this podcast is, or how poor other media has become.Bernie won’t win he doesn’t have faith in Jesus Christin 1941 we were faced with a war with China ? lolLMAO sorry Bernie you do not have a shot.Joe used the weakest argument for the opposition of $15 min wage increaseImagine Trump coming on the podcast one day and taking a hit of weed like Elon Musk. The internet would disintegrate and we would have to go back to living in cages.Thank you Joe Rogan and Bernie Sanders!  Great Show!!!Damn, only an hourOMG Bernie dropped the Bush&#39;s WMDs at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m40s">35:40</a> time mark, totally unreal. In regards to &quot;assault weapons&quot; that out number the military, are you outside your mind old man, please look up semi-auto and full-auto and get back to me about how the full-autos out number the militaryDemocratic Socialism = Communism 2.0Jesus Bermie, you had me with social medicine, free college, tax on speculation, but you&#39;re categorizing AR rifles the wrong way.  It stands for Armalite Rifle.  I agree we only want stable people to have them, but for fucks sake, stop calling them assault rifles, your message turns to white noise when you go there.  You&#39;re not meeting us in the middle.Trump is the only one that negotiated and told pharmaceutical companies to bring cost down. Bernie is late to the game even though he’s been in politics all his life. Climate change is a hoaxTRUMP 2020 ALL DAYBernie and Yang are incredible candidates!!How can something that requires another persons labor and study be a human right?I never understand why people frame healthcare as private or public exclusively. <br /><br />In the uk we have the NHS, everyone complains daily about the NHS, it’s become a national pastime like discussing the weather. Everyone also has the option to pay for private care/insurance if they have the money, which many people choose to do. But the NHS provides a base level of care/protection so you know you’ll never be left to die. It will take a while to get seen and if you have something serious you’ll want private, but you won’t get a £100k bill for going to the emergency room for some stitches. <br /><br />In the UK we spend an obscene amount on benefits (welfare), in the US your poison is military spending. If we can afford it, so can you.bernie KNOWS college will NEVER be free and he knows that he WILL NOT or cannot get universal healthcare.. he IS JUST TRYING TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE&#39;S VOTES. WAKE UP MANAppreciate the conversation. <br /><br />But none of the issues we have in America are justification for voting for this guy.Im so sick of this assault weapon ban and mass shooting talking point.  There are more folks killed in Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, and so many others on every weekend than in every mass shooting this year. Yes one weekend.  Are they using Assault weapons. No, illegally ( and legally) obtained handguns.  We need to have a better handle on just violence period across our nation.Fuck commie bastards hypocritesI literally begged for this after that awesome Cornell West segment...thank you Joe Rogan!Abolish the federal governmentBernie owns and maintains 3 houses.....What is the carbon footprint for 3 houses opposed to 1 house?  It&#39;s 66% more carbon output than one house.  now if he is unwilling to just live in 1 house to reduce carbon (They say 10 to 12 years it will be carratosphic) What am I to make of that... He is unwill to make the simple sacrifice he ask all of us to make.. therefore it is either not an emergency or he does not actually care and  excessively pollutes to enable his 3 house lifestyle... and he had many millions in the bank....  fuck him... walk the walk or shut the f up Bernie.. oh.. he fly in a private jet that pollutes as much as a thousand cars.... don&#39;t be fooled by this guy.. he is a fraud just like the rest of them...Randall Carlson. Make it happen man!Bernie and people who think like him have zero understanding about human nature.Joe Rogan: &quot;doesn&#39;t sound radical at all&quot; hahahahahah oh dearHonestly I was hoping for some more personal words from a great man, not just the same talking points we hear everywhere else.. I know he&#39;s on the campaign trail, but a JRE episode only 1 hr?!  Its the biggest damn podcast on the planet Bernie! Give us more than that!Make America Great Again doesn&#39;t mean supporting the middle class or helping the poor<br /><br />It mean make America how it was when racism was okBernie sounds like he&#39;s making a ASMR video.I haven’t watched the video yet but... I’ll be disappointed if there isn’t alien and DMT talk in this.You&#39;re gonna blow out your upper spine with that posture one day bernieWould have REALLY liked to hear about immigration! Otherwise, appreciate listening to thisWhat was Bernie doing last night <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=20m45s">20:45</a>My sister has got breast cancer. She couldn&#39;t afford to pay 50000 dollars. Fortunately she has double Citizenship. So she is doing well thanks to the Universal Healthcare  in Argentina.   Healthcare is a human right. It is not a commodity.You won&#39;t find any right wingers trying to shut bernie down, or deplatforming joe rogan for this podcast.   Because right wingers are sane.why isnt he smoking cannabis or drinking whiskey with bernie?Conservative Republican here, and this is the first time I listened to THIS Bernie Sanders, fox paints him in a different light.  A lot of the things he said apply to my situation and my community.  I&#39;ll keep an open mindJoe &quot;Alt-Right&quot; Rogan. Sure brooooo. Glad to see Bernie on the show to get a fair hearing.You&#39;re helping to change the world, Joe.  Thank you for shining a light on this man.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>All I heard is we have great dreams on how to rule the world, and take your (my) tax dollars and create something better. Smaller govt FTWBERNIE: Hi world, let&#39;s spend less on defense and more on helping our people celebrate themselves. <br /><br />PUTIN:  Sounds great Bernie, you first.Great interview Joe. You&#39;re doing a great service for everyone by organizing these long-form interviews.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BERN2020">#BERN2020</a> !!!Please keep having the candidates on your podcast! Joe, you&#39;re great! I have a new understanding of Bernie and I&#39;d like to understand every other candidate. Fantastic work Joe!Burnie Canadas healthcare isnt as good or better then the US that is a blatant lie i lived in Canada for 8 years.He&#39;s so full of shit. Canada&#39;s single payer system does not have as good as or better healthcare than America. Maybe their private system does, but that&#39;s a different story.A lot of Bernie haters on here 11k dislikes.Would Joe ever have Trump on his show? If he did the internet would explode!👽 Joe and Bernie are aliens 👽Bernie is principled, yet a total coward. He refused to defend himself in 2016 when the DNC sabotaged him. He&#39;s weakNever forget he’s still a politician as Tulsi is. Always remember this fact! The best conmen are the most believable!THISFemale children are on these drugs as well they are not killing other children though but abuse and neglect during childhood are other reasons they snap. This is toxic masculinity and for the older men a loss of hope and even violence towards females when they are denied what they percieve to be entitlements in the form of sex from women(Involuntary Celebate male communit). Think about how the guy like Dayton(GM and at least one other factory closed) who realizes there are no good factory jobs in his town anymore because they have all been outsourced to China and Mexico. We have mostly young men who feel worthless and are angry because of it and they take it out on everyone else to lash out at.I would love to watch a long form interview style series of joe and the candidates. Even bring trump in. I think this corner of the internet is stable enough to say that last part.Terrible, Joe. Softball questions just like you did with Jack. Bring someone in to really ruffle his feathers.It’s not oppression.... it’s Democratic oppression!Why thoNot a liberal but i would appreciate more of these discussions with the upcoming candidates if at all possible, Id appreciate Andrew Yang in Particular very intriguing yet seemingly does not have a foothold on a platform to discuss his ideas...Bernie&#39;s commie ideas would drive the US into the dirtWhat if we did a complete redesign of guns? What if they were electronic and what if they had a &quot;kill switch&quot; when in certain areas?Joe! You are doing America such a huge favor. Thank you for this!Bernie makes me hardWhat do you HONESTLY KNOW about Jeffrey Epstein Bernie Sanders?... Tell the AMERICAN COMMUNITY without Lying?  What are your friends doing on the SIDE?..  Why did Bernie LAY down when Hilary stole the Bernie Campaign money?..  You went to Sleep Bernie.  Why do you have Big Houses and expensive cars Bernie?.. Explain this Bernie?Healthcare is not a human rightyou need a 15 dollar minimum wage, plus 40 hours.thats the key. i got a raise to 15.55 an hour but i only get like 30 hours now. so it balances out to like 8 an hour.Bernie Sanders has the other GREEN New Deal!Joe have the Chapo guys onGet this guy on the chip chipperson podcast next!Rumor has it they ate elk meat and smoked up after the podcast.I like Bernie till he starts talking about gunsFree market capitalism, with all its flaws, brought about the highest standard of living in human history in record time... evil billionaires built the infrastructure of railways 100 years ago, and airwaves and technology today... just saying...<br />Great interview Joe, I appreciate this format.Lol.... all I heard was issues with no plans on how to do it.... let me tell you something if you want to provide free shit.... some one has to pay, and don&#39;t be stupid and say, government it&#39;s you you will be paying for it.say a 60 to 70 % tax.... that&#39;s what you will need to be at to pay for all that shit, yea the US IS shit out of luck for all those issues but you guys are not living in India..... just sayingGood job JoeBWAAAHH<br />Gimme ya moneyThere has to be a safe space for Freedom from Government. We need to keep that, or at least continually establish that in the US.Thanks for this JoeSo greatGotta say, he didn&#39;t convert me from the yang gang.are you fucking kidding me?Loved hearing Bernie on healthcare so far. But just have to mention that he&#39;s been fed incorrect information if he thinks you can go to a gun show and buy guns without doing any background search and/or paper work. @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m58s">34:58</a>  He must be talking about private sales not affiliated with gun shows or gun shops. I guess you could unknowingly sell it to someone wishing to do some harm. In Texas there is no mandate to undergo a background search for private sales but there is a law prohibiting selling to criminals or minors: Tex. Penal Code § 46.06(a): May not knowingly transfer firearms to anyone intending to use it unlawfully; a child under 18 (without parent or guardian&#39;s permission); or an intoxicated person. So if he&#39;s singling out Texas, sure his final example is true you could legally buy the guns, and illegally sell them to criminals but nevertheless its AGAINST THE LAW. However, 23 other states have some kind of penal code dictating the process of background checks in private sales, yet none of them prevent the the scenario he is portraying. It&#39;s a dumb argument.I think some of his answers could have been more succinct but this is by far a more thorough and objective interview than any &quot;reporter&quot; has done.JOE!<br /><br />I never knew you pitched softball too...I understand joe isn’t a journalist so he doesn’t have to be objective, but, what’s with the softball questions and no pushback on some topics. You want to have a candidate on to know his views, you need to expand on the answers.An hour simply isn&#39;t enough. Bernie was just starting to open up before he had to leave. he should do a full length return podcast.All The world is watching 🍁Tulsi 2020Thanks Joe for letting Bernie on your program!What is crazy is that in Baltimore there is even an event  called Ceasefire weekends that happen quarterly to try and do something to reduce the gun violence in that city.Bernie Sanders - Steal from the rich to give to the poor.Heart surgery and a month stay in Canada and the bill is $0.? Wow! Too bad you have to wait 39 weeks on average before your surgery. You old Red scoundrel. Say goodbye Bernie.yay! cancel out student loan debts of $400,000 for the doctors, lawyers, and accountants of the world. Give more of our money to the 1%.Imagine if Bernie and Warren endorsed each other. And campaigned on bringing both campaigns and the people behind them together. Bernie&amp;Warren 2020Hope a lot of new people gain so respect for Sanders.The man answered the questions. The man believes in people. Regardless of his views.So militarize police and disarm citizens? Love Bernie but thats the only thing I disagree withSo this interview is a thing.<br /><br /><br />Awesome.hey look, it is one of the clownadates from the left.Cancel the DNC debates and let’s get every candidate on a JREThis is what the debates should of been&quot;White people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot;Wasn’t expecting much from this podcast, nothing new from Bernie.But really cool that Joe was able to have him on.  <br /> On another note, wouldn’t it be better to make make higher education more affordable in other ways. Like regulating the colleges and universities.We need to get Trump on the JRE nowWhite people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor <br /><br />- crazy BernieI really would like to know why he thinks that funding everything by taxing Wall Street is actually going to work out?<br /><br />These massive increases in government programs would just cause more bloat, more wastage, more corruption, as people line their pockets.<br /><br />Most of the problems can be solved by freeing up the system and giving people choice.  Tax people less, trim down the federal budget by a massive amount, make companies compete with each other vigorously, and things will boom.Bernie why don’t you go on the Sunday special with Ben Shapiro? Why not talk to someone who disagrees with you in a calm respectful way? I bet you are afraid of your base calling you a racist or alt right aren’t ya?Drop your preconceived notions and just listen to this man. Bernie for President.Very sad love america  your music culture  .elvis .space nasa moon landing  .sinatra.   hollywood of the thirties  etc  broadway   50s cars  comedy cheers. taxi . Friends .  motown  boxing ali joe frazer .etc ufc .drive in movies steve mc queen.  marlon brando. james dean  great actors   on and onWow, big stupid waste of your life! Who woulda thought🤤commie  idiots!!!How many women did you talk to last night Bernie?😂I’m not big on politics at all in terms of taking sides, I just want whoever’s in charge to do a decent job but this was a really fair and honest interview. I am American who lives in Australia and was floored at how great the healthcare is here. Even mental healthcare.No such thing as a free lunch Bernie? Someone has to pay for it! And it won&#39;t be the top end wealthy so middle class will fill the void.Wow so cool to hear this, 2020!Look Joe, the truth is “I’m not that radical” — I’m a millionaire — And let’s not forget about the drug companies...You do not go to any doctor you want in Canada and get free treatment. You also have to wait much longer for treatment than you do in America, unless you&#39;re using private healthcare.Not a fan of Bernie but i do respect him for coming on a show like this.Mass shooting definitions vary. More people are killed by blunt objects than rifles every year. Most murders are by black boys in cities.huge respect to Bernie for doing this. Hopefully more candidates do this11k boot-lickers so farfor the sake of this country, i’m a college student that has a part time job. the amount of student debt i will have to pay is depressing. Forget marriage and buying a house, i’m going to spend the rest of my life paying these greedy corporations money for education. Please win Bernie, help me, help americaBan on assault weapons = lost my votei thought this was an onion bitBernie!!Joey Diaz should host a debateCanadian healthcare is just as good or better? You ridiculous old coot, that is inherently fucking false. Also the wait times are fucking ridiculous and canadians come HERE instead. I&#39;m 15 mins from the boarder and know several canadians who go back and forth. American healthcare is FAR superior.  Always remember this.....good healthcare isnt cheap and cheap healthcare isnt good...The meme himself3 minutes in this statist is already talking about using the government to force what he wants on others.  In the most direct ways too... No we could never voluntarily work with others to get what we want so let&#39;s use the state to force them.  Point guns at them and if they don&#39;t go along throw them in cage.  If they resist shoot them, because politicians need their air time and I (Bernie Sanders) have a right to their audience, their network, and their property.<br /><br />If this is supposed to make me relate to Sander&#39;s thought process or consider his ideas it does not.  He blew it too fast.  Joe is talking to evil person, evil career politician.<a href="https://youtu.be/tsFB1AERBmA">https://youtu.be/tsFB1AERBmA</a>This was a good interview. I don&#39;t like Bernie&#39;s positions or policies at all, but he is very correct about the media circus and the TV debates. I wonder what the chances are of Joe getting Trump on for a similar interview in or before campaign season.Feel the fucking BernThe way he explained his tax proposal on Wall Street speculation to pay for student loans actually makes perfect sense! He spits fire at Wall Street from about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=29m00s">29:00</a> to about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=31m00s">31:00</a>There have not been 270 mass shootings in a year, Joe. That&#39;s more than one every other day.Thanks for doing this Joe. To think, all of this started as an outlet to have conversations with people you thought were interesting.It&#39;s a relief to finally see a moderator that can honestly ask a question with an open mind and zero bias. Awesome job Joe. Why is this so difficult to do for everybody else...CNN Fox News MSNBC etc...not a single one has come even close to Joe&#39;s honesty.!!!!!I am not watching this. I was in the military serving this country when this backstabbing communist was honeymooning in the USSR. He spouts his Marxist bullshit while he is a millionaire with 3 homes. I don&#39;t give a damn what he has to say.This was one of my favorite podcasts...and I&#39;ve been a fan for a while. Having someone share their ideas without having (until the end) to call the other side stupid or racist/sexist/etc. is something that is missing from our political narrative. THIS was the best political conversation I&#39;ve heard in a while...I still don&#39;t agree with all of Bernie&#39;s solutions but he seems genuine that he wants to do what he can to help people&#39;s lives get better. We NEED ideas from both sides of the aisle to give everyone options on how to best tackle problems. Search and share possible solutions...don&#39;t just point at problems. Well done Joe and Bernie!!Billionaires do not want Bernie to win.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but true.  They will campaign against him by utilizing marketing tactics that will manipulate Americans to vote for someone else...Health care is not a right.Man we need this guy so badly in this country. We need him so badly!!!! He is legitamately for the paople. He is the best thing since Kennedy. He is absolutely correct in what he is saying corporate america has gotten out of control. The military industrial complex is out of control. The fed is out of control. It&#39;s crazy right now. I wonder if he won what would happen? My god what a change. It would change the world for the betterholy shitI know joe doesn’t read comments but what about the perpetual fuckin war?? Starting to feel like 1984 out here! This episode couldn’t be long enough great show. You shoulda smoked him out with some of that Tyson shitBerts fatOk, so that&#39;s Tulsi, Yang and Bernie who&#39;ve done Joe&#39;s show. (Have I missed any?) I wonder if the rest will have the guts to do it? If you&#39;re lying and hiding your true intentions it&#39;s REALLY difficult to sit down one-on-one for an hour or two - especially with a straight-up guy like Rogan!that was great...until Bernie brought up the &quot;climate change&quot; issue... there is ZERO evidence for man made climate change when you look at the scientific facts showing the climate over the last 100000 years..Don’t fall asleep to this. He starts to sound like a radio tunerAlright, its time to get Bernie Sanders and Alex Jones together on the podcastLost me on the Second Amendment hate.  I wish Joe would have saved that question to the end so I could hear the other things ol&#39; Bernie had to say.I’m blown away by how good this interview was.From a non US citizen, that was really good. Politicians need time to bring their full ideas out for discussion. Way to go Joe &amp; Sen. SandersHoly cheap! Bernie on Rogan! What a move!Yea right I’m going to give up all personal protection. I’ll just tell the killers “ you’re breaking the law now don’t kill me and turn yourself it to the cops”might aswell have kanye on with trump now joe they would def love the shine“Chiner” and “russiar” 😂 get em bernman, I kinda thought Bernie was ok even before watching this, but after I fully watched all this podcast I&#39;m like &quot;Hooolly shiit, this guys makes like TOOOONS of sense, woooow, now I&#39;m really rooting for him&quot;Andrew yang thoFeel the bern.I&#39;m actually impressed he went on JRE, but his policies still have no regard for our economy and what impact they will haveHE SOUNDS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE😂😂😂<br /><br />I’m glad they kept this short...<br /><br />It’s very honest... probably too honest. <br />❤️<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dontDisCredittBernie">#dontDisCredittBernie</a>instead of banning assault weapons we could just require that all businesses hire an armed guard that is trained and of sound mind(veterans maybe?). its really stupid to be honest, these shootings happen in places where these sickos know that nobody is gonna fire back, and all it takes is a shot fired in the right direction to stop these tragedies. my heart goes out to the victims and their families, but simply banning things is not the solutionDang Sanders, very original about that opening line -_- everyone is taking Yang&#39;s linesIf you don’t like Bernie, consider this:<br /><br />1) our healthcare system sucks and the rest of the modern world does it better.<br /><br />2) corruption is a thing. Studies show that special interests get their policies while the American people get nothing that they want from Congress.<br /><br />3) Climate Change is a thing. You either believe in science and evidence, or you’re an idiot.<br /><br />4) Keynesian Economics works. The New Deal worked. Eisenhower continued most of it and we haven’t had a RECESSION FOR DECADES. Economic inequality was low and Unions had POWER. Source: Golden Age of Economic Expansion.<br /><br />5) Bernie isn’t a Communist or even a Classical Socialist. He’s a Nordic-Style Social Democrat, and if you actually empirically look at those countries, there’s prosperity and happiness.<br /><br />Once you acknowledge these premises, Bernie seems like the only sensible candidate for the presidency.Bring trump on nowHas Democrat politicians on but not Republicans...hmm..Sander&#39;s plans are actually extremely destructive and would actually punish people far more than it would help. Taxes for everyone would be higher, but the GDP and Revenue for the Nation would be damaged severely making it harder to pay for all of the various things Sanders wants. His plans simply are not realistic and point to his ignorance on how a business and the economy works. Tons of businesses, and even Sanders himself have had to reduce hours of workers or even fire employees, to be able to meet 15 dollars an hour. There are even recycling centers in the states that have passed 15 an hour minimum wage, that have laid off most of their workers, and several closed down due to no longer being able to stay open. Sanders doesn&#39;t understand his own plan, or is lying to people that think they&#39;ll get a bunch of free stuff.<br /><br /><i>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</i><br />Senator Bernie Sanders’s tax plan would reduce the economy’s size by 9.5 percent in the long run. The plan would lead to 4.3 percent lower wages, an 18.6 percent smaller capital stock, and 6.0 million fewer full-time equivalent jobs. The smaller economy results from higher marginal tax rates on capital and labor income. <br /><br />Overall, the plan would increase federal revenue on a static basis by $13.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Most of the revenue gain is due to increased payroll tax revenue, which are projected to raise approximately $8.3 trillion over the next decade. The changes to the individual income tax will raise an additional $4.9 trillion over the next decade. The remaining $350 billion would be raised through increased estate taxes and taxes on corporations.<br /><br />If you account for the economic impact of the plan, it would end up raising $9.8 trillion over the next decade. The smaller economy would reduce wages and investment income, which would narrow the revenue gain from the income tax changes to $2.8 trillion and the revenue gain from the payroll tax changes to $7.0 trillion. <br /><br />The largest sources of revenue in the plan are the new “health care premiums”: a 6.2 percent employer-side payroll tax and a 2.2 percent increase in the individual income tax. Together, these provisions would raise $6.6 trillion over 10 years, or $5.2 trillion after accounting for economic effects.<br /><br />Another significant source of revenue for the Sanders plan has to do with the tax treatment of health insurance. Currently, households are not required to pay taxes on the value of health insurance they receive from their employers, which leads to over $300 billion a year in reduced federal revenue. However, the Sanders plan would put an end to nearly all privately-provided insurance. As a result, employers would cease to compensate their employees with health insurance and would instead increase their wages and salaries by the value of the health insurance plans they used to provide. These higher wages and salaries would then be subject to income and payroll taxes, causing federal tax revenues to increase by $3.6 trillion over the next decade, or $3.3 trillion after accounting for economic effects.<br /><br />The components of the plan aimed specifically at increasing taxes on high-income households (partially removing the Social Security payroll tax cap, adding four new income tax brackets, and taxing capital gains and dividends at ordinary income rates) would increase federal revenue by $2.9 trillion on a static basis and $1.4 trillion after accounting for economic effects.<br /><br />On a static basis, the Sanders tax plan would reduce the after-tax incomes of taxpayers in every income group. <b>The bottom 50 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes decrease by at least 4.87 percent.</b> The top 50 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes decrease by at least 8.57 percent. Finally, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes fall by 17.91 percent.<br /><br />After accounting for economic effects, <b>taxpayers in all income groups</b> would see <b>their after-tax incomes decrease by at least 12.84 percent.</b> The top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their incomes decrease by 24.88 percent.<br /><br />Senator Bernie Sanders would enact a number of tax policies that would raise tax revenue over the next decade. Together, his proposals would moderately expand federal revenue collections by $13.6 trillion on a static basis, driven mostly by broad-based taxes on income and payroll. If enacted, the Sanders plan would <b>significantly increase marginal tax rates on capital and labor income,</b> which would <b>result in a substantial reduction of the size of the U.S. economy in the long run.</b> <b>This would decrease the revenue that the new tax policies would ultimately collect to $9.8 trillion.</b> Senator Sanders’s plan <b>would decrease after-tax incomes for taxpayers at all income levels, but especially high-income taxpayers.</b>Socialism = communism light you can slap democratic in front of it but it doesnt change the fact. Alls you have to ask is how are you going to pay for any of this Bernie without tanking our economy.  He just wants to steal your money which you worked hard for. Redistribution is bullshit its stealing from someone to give to another .Amazing !!If more debates were hosted online, I would be way more interested in our politics..  Fantastic Job Joe.. And keep working on those deep questions!! We have a lot to uncover around here!!! 💖💖💖💖It’s not ‘free’ for a candidate to be on TV in the UK. The TV channels that they go on is funded by the tax payer.Can&#39;t believe he delved into the topic of world war 2 at the end and iterated to the entire public audience that we were at war with the nazis and the Chinese. Lol, Hiroshima and Nagasaki ring a bell? The Japanese were so ruthless in war, impossible to take prisoner. Americans were honestly lucky aside from the fact they utilized atomic warfare, which was despicable.This comment section is pure comedy. The amount of people who think this guy isn’t the establishment is hilarious or perhaps scary.By far Bernie&#39;s biggest flaw in his environmental policy is his opposition to nuclear power. His opposition is neither scientifically or statistically backed, seeing as nuclear power is the cleanest, safest, and most reliable form of energy we have. Wind and Solar&#39;s unreliability when used on a mass scale without the creation of absolutely immense energy storage banks means that fossil fuels, namely natural gas, need to be used to fill the gaps. Nuclear doesn&#39;t have this issue. Not to mention the fact that they produce more industrial waste than nuclear power does, requiring far greater resource extraction infrastructure, and the immense land requirements. <br /><br />As such, it&#39;s not surprising that the natural gas lobby has invested into anti-nuclear lobbying, all while investing heavily in the wind and solar industries and anti-nuclear pro-renewable &quot;environmentalist&quot; lobbying groups like the Sierra Club. Bernie&#39;s opposition to nuclear puts him firmly on the side of the fossil fuel industry, even if it&#39;s the progressive side of that industry. <br /><br />The knee-jerk reaction that was the widespread nuclear slowdown following Fukushima (which ended up proving how incredibly safe modern nuclear power is, seeing as a triple meltdown only caused one death, 11 or so injuries, has caused no increases in birth defects or cancer rates, and only led to a 10 km radius being blocked off, not to mention only releasing 1/10th the radiation of Chernobyl despite being 3 times the size) has been one of the biggest reasons why we don&#39;t already have much cleaner power. Dozens of nuclear plants were planned to be built before Fukushima, which would have replaced hundreds of coal and oil power plants, but anti-nuclear lobbyists pounced after Fukushima happened. Germany has barely reduced their emissions despite hundreds of billions spent on &quot;renewables&quot; because at the same time their anti-nuclear lobby got them to dismantle their nuclear power plants. <br /><br />Nuclear as the primary provider of power is really our only option for replacing fossil fuels. Wind and Solar (preferably just wind, solar is by far the dirtiest of the low-carbon power sources) have a place, just not as our primary sources of power.Thanks for taking the time to do a interview with Bernie. I do not agree with him on several issues but it was nice to hear his rational behind them. Well done!Bern dog!!! Not another politician in the world as honest as him!Excellent interview, Bernie would be the best president for the people of America, but I&#39;m skeptical that the giant corporations would ever let him take power in the sham democracy.To say healthcare is a human right is to say that we can force doctors to give free medical treatment. There&#39;s no two ways about it.I&#39;m not an expert on healthcare but there are no countries on the scale of the United States which have even close, to the size of our entitlement system, add on the fact that we subsidize a ton of medical research which other countries then import cheaply, it also helps that many of these so called welfare state utopias(Canada, Nordic States, etc.) have very small populations heavily funded by oil reserves. Furthermore the 0.5% tax on each high frequency stock trade is not well thought out, while it seems small, even the best high frequency funds earn about 30% on their capital per year, that means a few dozen trades and they would be in the negative for the year. I respect Bernie Sanders in that he has a coherent and consistent ideology that seems to come from a good place, however, I think it does not quite work out in reality. I think we are nearly as close as we can get to the best possible in terms of balancing economic growth and having a social safety net, the only thing we can really do is to get more efficient in how we use the current system, which means eventually something like UBI or a more robust earned income tax credit. More regulation or taxes maybe give you a moral victory, but there&#39;s not much they can improve with the limits on what is possible to get from them without totally destabilizing the economy or government.Bernie2020Thank you Joe!! Finally. Tulsi was a good start but there is a reason why Tulsi stood up for Bernie!!Feel the Bern!!!!If we all spoke like this in the political realm, it would be a less divisive world.KING, not president.Joe I am a long time fan of yours and have noticed that the mere idea of socialism scares you. Thanks for putting your personal feeling aside and having Bernie on! He is the only hope we have!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Hey Joe, google some ER closures in Nova Scotia.

As the saying goes, When seconds count, the cops are just minutes away. Arm yourselves people!!I say if you want a assault weapons you should have to apply for a license for them.This is what a political interview should be like , not that bullshit 6 min interview on FOX , CNN , MSNBC etc etc .... Joe has nothing to loose vs these typical cable channel interviewers ...2028 Joe Rogan will run for President and suceedI live in Canada . We have &quot;free health care&quot; and pay twice as much in taxes . Guess where canadians go when they need emergency surgery (especially transplants) yup you guess it . The United StatesA 0.5% transaction tax is insane. This just disincentives people from entering the market, or selling their assets, i.e. restricts capital flows and investments in new companies. The rich will just reallocate their transactions to occur abroad. A wide VAT-system like in most european countries would be a much better way to raise funds.Damn good job, Rogan. Best I&#39;ve seen. See how good you can be when you cut the crap &amp; act in good faith?Bernie is such an odd duck.<br />He is not of the people.  He can’t relate.<br />God help us if he becomes President.  I cringe.Brrgurggurnburrrbbgguurr politics.Bernie lost me on college.  The reason tuition is skyrocketing is because it backed by government loans you claim bankruptcy on.   Come on man.  Like he says it was basically free.  Yeah and my parents liked each other then.  94-98  lake house down payment.

Regardless of ideology having a discussion with anyone is important.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=52m23s">52:23</a> describing the lives of many. So much wisdom from this man.&quot;Fire side chats with Bernie.&quot;Now get Trump onGetting money out of politics is the issue that made me a fan of BernieI hate how Joe didn&#39;t bring up the Panama Papers. The fact that all major media is covering it up is such a disservice.Fuck Bernie.Bernie is the manDrug companies don&#39;t do cures anymore. It&#39;s all about health maintenance. Keeping people sick but alive makes far more money than curing an illness.So blatant example of Bernie&#39;s ignorance. So a guy in Nevada is collecting Social Security at 50 year old? Really? blah blah blah.Canada&#39;s health care is garbage. They have lines out the door. Waiting to get treated. Some people die waiting for treatment. If you want fast treatment, guess what you have to do. PAY MONEY.I appreciate the platform to allow a full understanding of what he or anyone else has to say. As a Canadian I can assure you that our healthcare system isn&#39;t as rosy as he says. Massive amounts of debt and less staff yearly. Etc etc. Less government is the answer not more.Soo many dislikes...I don&#39;t understand.You had this retard on instead of Soph?I’m definitely not gonna be voting for Bernie but I still liked the podcastHey Bernie?  What do you think of the Jesuit Infiltration of the Vatican Church and Lodges channeling in the New Age types in this post Capitalism and trying to prove a Socialism type society?.. The BIG QUESTION is the Jesuit/Zionist/NEW AGE Connection?..  Channeling in a Aleister Crowley types running the USA and Globalist views?..  Seems kind of weird Bernie SandersSorry i still cant get behind burnie after watching this there is no way he can pay for these plaims without raising taxes above 50% for the average American.<br /><br />And the benefits of these programs arnt going to be  worth what id pay in taxes. My cost of living would go up under his plansJust cause  he mentioned Pearl harbor the Japanese stopped at pearl harbor due the fear of us citizens owning guns if that was not the case we would be speaking Japanese right nowNo thanks. Next!!!I like watching this 5 hours after release cause theres like 200k people watching it with meJoe Rogan is either really dumb or just throwing another softball interview.Ended with aliens. AMAZINCommunity college is a completely affordable way of getting an education equal to most 4 year universities that will throw you in debt for the rest of your life. It’s a status quo people want more than the legitimate education.&#39;The idea that healthcare is a human right is not a radical idea&#39; - Yes, it is. This is fucking moronic.I have to give it to joe, he might be more conserbative than i would like but unlike the majority of the conserbatives I know he actually likes to have a good faith conversation.That last question Bernie took it as a Joke in contrast to Joe who sounded so serious. Joe  should have laughed too. It felt a bit awkward.Health insurance for illegal aliens. Socialized health care, free tuition...um no, never! I agree with him on regulating the pharmaceutical companies and closing tax loopholes. But my lord, I could never vote for his crazy.Unless you&#39;re calling out Zionism as the root of the problems facing America, I&#39;m not interestedYou forgot to invite alex JonesJoe Rogan for president ?Ask him why he constantly fucking lies about the president? Ask him why he wants to destroy our economy? Old commie bastard!!sanders is 100% a hypocrite and dont forget he IS the establishment<br /><br /><br />maga2020<br />1luv<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m15s">27:15</a> <br />Bernie: 50 years ago do know how much the University California cost in tuition?<br />Joe: How much?<br />Bernie: Virtually free.<br />Joe: What&#39;s it now?<br />Bernie: I don&#39;t know.<br />hahahahahahaha, Why did he use it as his example if he doesn&#39;t even know the numbers?!?!Rumor has it Joe shilled alpha brain onto Bernie after the showThe fucking argument is that the <b>job</b> is for kids. If an adult that&#39;s 30 years old decides to work at McDonald&#39;s for 10 bucks an hour that&#39;s their fault. They&#39;ve hard atleast 12 years of work experience and they squandered it and because of that they&#39;re only worth 10 an hour. Fuck me  think people.Richard Wolff next please.Disappointed in Joe here for not phoning in Randal Carlson... Climate change is settled &quot;im not a scientist&quot;...Can someone else talk about the fact Bernie did the podcast then went to the San Diego Pier and dunked on some kids then held a rally afterwardsAsk trump to come on. He might do it. It would break the internet.Wow, of all people...... this guy?It’s ironic how conservatives scream “Money shouldn’t be spent on lobbying! Drain the swamp!”<br /> <br />Democrats: “Okay let pass legislation and regulations”<br /><br />Conservatives: “How dare you commie! You’re a socialist! Capitalism!”10,000+ dislikes?<br />BitchesI&#39;m kinda wondering what Trump is like without the boisterous and over the top showmanship he is associated with. He should come on here too, along with Dan Crenshaw.I always liked Ross Perot&#39;s Ideas. Bernie sounds like him. Ross always said that Congress and the Senate needed to be eliminated and that we would make the votes. I think this is the solution. If we made the vote then, we&#39;d get the $100 in our pockets. Assault rifles shouldn&#39;t be in anyones arm except the military. I eat squirrels and need a 4/10. Jesus is the answer because he could of become king. He loved the world so much that he didn&#39;t. We all sin. Yes it&#39;s written about Trump. A liar who will lead us wrong, but it doesn&#39;t matter because the other side is wrong too. No man with power is worthy. Shoots fired and they&#39;re gone. He was unleashed in the early times. Maybe medieval. Chill people and relax. Be good to your neighbors and don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s no right choice. We only need to live in peace. Read the New Testament, even if you don&#39;t believe. You&#39;ll see!I guess I&#39;m a Bernie fan!Minimum wage job positions are not meant to support a family on. They are simply a conduit into the working world to get work experience and better your life. Through hard work and a higher education, eventually you would move to a higher position within your company/career and make a higher wage.Bernie is a wizard of words  full of half truths and or falsities. I dropped out of college, worked hard, and bought a house at 24 yrs old when my daughter was born.  Meanwhile, many of my friends live with their parents until their early 30&#39;s thanks to student loan debt.  Highschools lied, heads of colleges banked, and the small hat bankers made billions in interest. They knew people were going to be desperate and use post graduate loans to buy cars and go on vacations. Community College cost average 4k a year. Bernie never had a job or owned a business.  He Use to write dirty, smut,  porn, columns till like he was 40. What a bum!Fuck socialism!Beto O’Rourke next please.I just think he’s too old. I guess thats ageist. but he’s like 95I cannot even begin to elaborate on how b&#39;s it is you even gave this commie peice of trash a platform.... Bernie could get raped and I would fucking dance. Commie piece of shit needs it for how he wants to rape america.How come people dont talk about mass shootings as a disease or despair, or link mass shooting to economic distress?We ALL hate corruption. We ALL hate the influence of big pharma, big oil, health insurance on BOTH PARTIES in Washington. I get why some of you people voted for Trump. You&#39;re sick of this, like me. But Bernie Sanders is the REAL outsider.Great show but I really would like to see his sources. Providing solutions to over simplified problems seems irresponsible. Where can we fact check his info?But will the depraved people and criminals give up their weapons? He’s asking the law abiding civilians to give up their protection. It doesn’t make sense.so about 53 people were shot this weekend in Chicago, 1,517 have been shot in Chicago so far this year!  Why is Bernie not screaming about this?  why is the media not screaming about this?  I agree that something has to be done about this however the political games need to stop and the real issues need to be addressed.LEGALIZE IT !!!!!! THEN IT&#39;S ONE LESS PROBLEM - AMSTERDAM IS STILL A GREAT CITY AND THEY DID IT DECADES AGO. REGULATE IT AND TAX IT - THEN WE HAVE A THRIVING ECONOMY. MAKE SENSE.the earth isnt heating up it is getting cooler and dryer. We are going into another mini ice age. A natural cycle of the earth. Souce? Raymond H Wheeler. This was his lifes work.The issue is Military Industrial Complex. If guns are banned in the USA there will me more coups &amp; wars around the world. Where will the MIC make profits from. They will cause wars all over the world.There is no gun show loop hole... Bernie Sanders is full of crap. Joe being a 2A advocate should have jumped on him about that. Smh if I’m wrong link the court case or video evidence.Straw purchases are illegal at gun shows.The guns aren&#39;t a problem. Brazil has strong gun troll and 10 times the murdersBernie2020! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernTheConstitution">#BernTheConstitution</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23OnYourKneesForYourOverlords">#OnYourKneesForYourOverlords</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23GovernmentProblemsNeedGovernmentSolutions">#GovernmentProblemsNeedGovernmentSolutions</a>Rogan/Bravo 420*<br /><br />*2020It’s like Joe is talking to his grandpa.Conservative here, but it’s very refreshing to hear Bernie expand on his ideas instead of his “millions and billions” “one percent” catchphrases. Found some points I actually agree with him on, also. Well done!Bernie never answers any direct questions.I don&#39;t really agree with most of Bernie&#39;s positions but I definitely enjoy this kind of interview.   Thank you  joe Rogan, thank you for the opportunity to hear Bernie talk about his ideasdont sell assualt weapons in the US, but dont build the wall either?👍👍👍👍👍Joe Rogan should run for the president..not kiddingGet Donald, Hillary and Obama on the podcast. Not necessarily together haha“An assault weapon is a weapon designed to kill human beings.” Hate to break it to Bernie, but almost anything could be brandished as a weapon to kill a human being. I can use an assault pillow to smother you to death. Very ignorant on the issue of guns.Where are all my toxic JRE fans to talk shit about Bernie??? It’s just a bunch of lib fucks in this comment sectionAll presidential candidates from all parties should go talk to Joe.I barely make enough at my job every week to pay my weekly rent for a small room in a rooming house. I make $11 an hour but because I only get between 15-20 hours a week I can barely scrape by. If we raised the minimum wage to a living wage like Bernie is talking about ($15 an hour) then even with my modest hours every week I would be able to pay rent and take care of myself in fine style. Having a job, I shouldn&#39;t have to be scared about not making rent and neither should anyone else, that&#39;s why we&#39;re gonna elect Bernie in 2020.Oh fuck no 👎This OAP would be President for about a month before he had to retire. TRUMP 2020.UNIONS, MAKE AMERICA WORK AGAINI&#39;m undecided on how he&#39;d fit as a President, but I think Bernie is the most like-able politician I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.  He seems to only care about the betterment of society as a whole and I respect the shit out of him.As the teeter-tottering centrist I am, Bernie might have won my vote at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=52m10s">52:10</a>.He curbed his enthusiasmTuition cost so much because government pays for it, these schools know they can charge more and more.Sorry Bernie, lost me on the guns. Go to France with that stuff. Guns also protect us from criminals and  rogue governments alike. That slope is too slippery for my taste.My cousin is married to a Canadian, he will tell you first hand how terrible the heath care is in his country.Every primary candidate should do podcast with Joe RoganWhen is this getting turned into a rap?Didnt you go to Russia for your honeymoonJoe gonna hit 6 mil soonBernie out of the gate taking Andrew Yang&#39;s line (that he used in his closing remark at the 2nd debate) about debates being a reality TV show.Fck trumpJoe Rogan needs to host next debate for real! No bias just question and answer.Sooo... who&#39;s wondering what the odds are of an appearance from the president??Let’s look at the differences of the gun control stance, and the stance on drugs.<br /><br />If you could interchange the word to mass shootings I’d agree.Bernie should debate Ben Shapiro. He makes a lot of sense but so does Ben Shapiro when it comes to healthcare. They just might learn from each other and come to a middleground if they doI&#39;m sorry I never listened to Bernie before. I just listened to the hype.it took me 10 years to finish my Bachelor&#39;s degree taking part time classes while working full-time. And Bernie want to wipe student loan debt for people who took the fast track? How is that fair to people like me?Hey Bernie what do you think about the $15 per hour minimum wage you were hypocriticaly reluctant to pay your staff. You are a political joke Bernie. U r a failure because you dont have integrity.Well what the hell is this lmao. This one came out of no where. This should be interesting.I love JRE, i still think US elections are pure BS.  Even if Bernie does well he has to listen to the lobbyists in the end.  He&#39;s gonna be no different than any other presidents.  He has no say in bigger issues, lobbyists do.  They will destroy him if he doesn&#39;t listen.<br />Iran has that ayatollah as the supreme leader.   US has huge corporations behind the scenes.BERNIE!I never fully understood Berny&#39;s viewpoints before this podcast. This is why The JRE is #1 bcz we listen to what is really on people&#39;s minds and learn from their POV&#39;sWhat about trade schools?I gotta say, I was biased against Bernie by disliking whatever he said 100 percent but now that I watched this with an open mind my perception of him changed, not that I agree with everything he said, especially with economic issues and what sounds good saying it without actually explaining how would you accomplish such thing in a very complex economy in the USA and the worldI bet Joe Rogans YT will be hacked in order to access the data points on people who like this video. In order to benefit his campaign. I am a huge Bernie Fan though! Gotta fight fire with fire !I&#39;m still for Yang, but I agree Sanders is doing better in this long formatfantastic podcast. wish it was an hour or 2 longer. I think all presidetial candidates should have to do the @PowerfulJREGotta do a fight companion with Bravo, Joey Diaz and this dude!The most American candidate in modern historyWhy still use television? Because old people sit in front of the TV all day, and old people vote.Bernie Sanders isn&#39;t perfect, but he IS the best shot our country has at turning around this massive ship heading for a cliff. The thing about him is that he means every word he says, he WILL stand up to the oligarchs, and he WILL bring and IS bringing millions of people together for the best for us all. He WILL NOT sell us out like Obama/Biden did, like Hilary wanted to, like many other candidates on the democratic stage would if they got the chance. Because look at his record, he has not changed, he DOES NOT take corporate money, and he faithfully will execute legislation for the average American.I think Joe gave Bernie some good shit to blaze up and chillJre needs to invite Donut Operator to talk about mass shootings Donut Operator is ex swat and a police officer and he does videos about mass shootingsIn the UK our candidates dont get  allocated time to talk about what ever they want with the exception of a 1 minute plug at the end of a debateWHITE PRIDE WORLD WIDEonly an hour? sleepy commieThe &quot;green new deal&quot; and &quot;squad&quot; is not the pinnacle of liberalism. Bernie &amp; Tulsi know how to enact progressive policies, I as an aspiring pilot/mechanic hope to see electric vehicles forever!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=15m52s">15:52</a> Bernie admits he’s a fraud and can’t actually do anything he’s campaigning on.  Bye Felicialooking forward to watching this, I wonder about that rule that gives all candidates equal time, maybe we&#39;ll see more, I remember Tulsi Gabbard being onJoe is such a coward for not challenging him on anything.There is a tax on people buying and selling stocks. If you buy and sell the stock within a year, the profit you make is taxed at your normal income tax level. This is called short term capital gains tax, but there is also a long term capital gains tax from selling stocks held for over a year. If you make less then 10k a year you do not pay taxes on these gains, but if you make over 10k it is taxed at either 15% or 20%, depending on your income.Couldn’t you have stock investors and scientist for the oil company’s to invest their already established wealth into the sustainable energy business in collateral?<br /><br />A clean start!How many jobs have you had in your life bernieAwesome Joe . Great JobI don&#39;t agree with a lot of what was said, but that was an hour well spent listening. Thanks Joe Rogan.Support Bernie by contributing to his campaign today!Joe, I wished it could of been a longer episode. But I’m glad he was the one!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=32m30s">32:30</a> Did Bernie say he doesn’t have a MAGIC LANCE. Does he know that a deadly weapon.Bernie: university of California was virtually free <br />Joe: how much is it now?<br />Bernie: I don&#39;t knowAmerica needs to elect this guyI hate the ban assault weapons argument. If we make them illegal only bad people will have them. Like drugs are illegal but still easily accessible. Banning weapons will only take them away from good people who use them properly.I wanna hear about civil warBernie can’t look Joe in the eye, because he’s a beta in front of an alpha.What a waste of time. You have one of the biggest platforms in the world and you use it to promote this socialist.Sanders/Rogan 2020Wow the long form interview really opened my eyes, I see why people like Bernie now!Merchants of doubt, huh? like Alex Jones, Joe? I&#39;m just saying and I like your stuff, but you&#39;re giving some of these merchants of doubt a pulpit to espouse their shitty beliefs. You are culpable of spreading these messages when you allow them on.Love me some yuman rights.I&#39;m a very conservative Republican, and I&#39;ve always viewed Bernie as a radical socialist. After listening to him on here, I realize that he&#39;s not as radical as the press makes him see. Still gonna vote Trump 2020,  but I have a new respect for Bernie and his supporters.And his home state is a paradise?get him a drink of water. this is like poison to my earsMy biggest question to Bernie is, if he wants to give school and healthcare why do we need a $15 minimum wage? We wouldn&#39;t have to buy anything anymore; is it maybe so he can tax that $15 down to $6 an hour so people will actually be making less?Another sad commentary on what this great country has to offer as a possible presidential candidate. Trump was the lesser or two evils in 16. Sadly, from what I see his, his legacy should continue.Stop demonizing billionaires and rich people! Don’t like this thing about dems, that’s how the get all the poor people’s votesis Trump next?This is great, but nothing will change unless we hold the elected accountable in some way.“Get Hillary Clinton on the podcast!” - said no one everhe totally meant to say Japan, NOT China. Sorry China @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m40s">1:04:40</a>People were like &#39;Fuck Bernie I don&#39;t need education I&#39;ma sit around and play video games&#39; in 2016. Then they found out people are vulnerable to doing drugs in that state of mind. Now they&#39;re going to come crawling back to him to give them some hope at understanding stuff they couldn&#39;t teach themselves. I happen to be auto-didactic so it is not of my concern to access college. I wish to have more friends who relish learning and the institutions of intellect celebration and exploration.<br /><br />Please Bernie give us a new Renaissance period of American golden years!3 years from now...<br /><br /><br />Joe : Annnnnnnd we&#39;re live, how are you President Sanders?<br /><br /><br />Bernie: Joe, the aliens.....But is he going to go after the pedophiles that are rampant throughout our government and country? Children firstBernie will take 75% of the ad revenue 🤣We can&#39;t afford healthcare because we are paying for healthcare for those WHO DIDN&#39;T EARN IT!  You work, you eat, drink, go to the doctor. You sit on your ass, you die...We need a complete health care reform !! I stand with him on that clip.Host a Conservative candidate next!! <br />Oh wait there aren’t any. <br />‘Cause Trump 2020!!! 👍🏼 😁Fucking fantastic episode that got me enthusiastic about Bernie again but i wish joe had brought up other wrongfully harshly scheduled drugs like psychedelics that have seen decriminalization recently within the country and a potential reform on the national level to yknow, just to get it on his radarThanks. I always like listening to long form interviews on people I disagree with, because every once in a while you&#39;ve misunderstood them. This is far from that sort of case. Re-affirmed my dislike for this man.Yo Joe, I think it’s time we get President Trump on the show.You need to give these grown ass adults with kids a way out of McDonald’s jobs. Not just give them a raise for being content with mindless work.Bernie Sanders is a scam for low intelligence nerds that want everything to be free. Nothing is free especially freedom and you get what you pay for.This is what happens when someone asks questions without an agenda, we can have a substantive discussion ❤He seems like a good manBernie will destroy this country ... we’ll either be Venezuela or in the midst of a very short but very bloody civil war ... his side will be the losers.wtfDude is a nut. Socialism is shitRogan should host all presidential candidatesBernie Sanders has been consistent his entire career. He’s the best choice to begin the process of getting corruption out of our government.I love how this has been up 4 hours and only has <b>that</b> amount of views - yet Elon Musk surpassed that in about an hour.Kamala may have only had 12 seconds to respond, but she didn&#39;t even use those seconds to. Instead she used a blanket talking point. She also could&#39;ve come back to it later on. She obviously wants to to duck the issue.I don&#39;t think Bernie is a crazy person after watching this podcast. Good Job JRE. However, Bernie is still out of touch with a few issues. Gun violence and Climate change were the major ones. Great Podcast.absolutely love thisThank you very muchJoe Rogan for president!JOE!! Please get Tulsi Gabbard on your show. Very intelligent articulate veteran with great ideas and policies to match. The media, of course, barely gives her air time. We need you on this. Oh and she is from Hawaii, which as you know is pretty bad ass. Anyway, Excellent interview I learned a lot and actually agree with a lot of what was said.Bernie needs to start up an ASMR channel asap!I wouldn’t mind seeing some conservative candidates on here to see how they handle this format.I love this podcast, it honestly changed my life, but Joe didnt ask the right question on this one and let Bernie just ramble about whatever he wanted to. There were no answers to how his plans would be implemented other than taxing wall street and we all knew that was coming/ wont happen in our lifetime..Your &quot;pressure&quot; on Amazon to raise $15 hurt the employees. They cut the incentives like RSUs anyone who had been working there more than a year effectively got a pay cut.Bernie on jre is a huge dealI&#39;m scared of how ill informed this man, and many of these comments are... whoa.. Read some economics kids....And dear god Joe, I know you&#39;re left, but holy hell get some questions to askJoe have Trump on the podcast that would be VERY interesting.the questions Joe asks to make Bernie elaborate are outstanding.<br />the fact that Bernie admits that he doesn&#39;t have the perfect solution is so honest.<br />i think i&#39;m feeling the Bern againWhen a student takes out loans for education they knowingly take the loans  with the agreement they will pay the loan back.  it is a commitment that has to be met, no excuses.Are you fucking kidding me?Lol he looks like deathPlease have Marianne Williamson on your podcast.Bernie is the candidate of the people, not the corporations! Glad you gave us the opportunity to hear his message directly from him, rather than the skewed message we get from the Media!This is what the real left looks like. Not Clinton garbage.ooohhh shit, the internet just broke.Great to see candidates on regardless of what side they&#39;re on.As a Bernie fan it’s nice to see a long form conversation. Unfortunately, it makes it even more clear how much more thought out Andrew Yang’s proposals are compared to Bernie on every issue. Yang is running laps around him mentally at this point. We don’t have time to listen to grandpa at dinner anymore. We have to have the greatest intellectuals solving the most serious issues in the world in the most practical ways. It’s easy to see and predict how Andrew Yang could actually change the world for the better.I am really trying to get this idea out there. It serves as an alternative to Medicare for all/single payer while addressing the cost problem in all directions. This is achieved through profit incentives and contractual bidding for public coverage networks. <br /><br />A link to my essay about it <a href="https://link.medium.com/WW20kopVWY">https://link.medium.com/WW20kopVWY</a>Bernie is on a different level!! 👏👏his voice ... i just cannot handle his voice any longer ....Dodged questions.   Not impressed.  It’s tulsi or yang .  All the other dems are just more of the same career politiciansProud to be Canadian!! :)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=20m00s">20:00</a> in “when you talk to these amazon workers” YEA lol talk to any motherfuckers working at amazon for $15 an hour and they’ll bitch about how hard they are worked. Companies are NOT going to run labor % that high because of wages and not end up getting their return. It’s un fucking realisticIf you agree with this man, you have no idea what freedom is.Hahahaha still has time to ask about AliensSounded good until he says he will ban and take our guns.My like keeps getting scrubbed from this videoDamn it Bernie... a fist away from your mouth !Most people don&#39;t care whether it is american style &quot;debates&#39; or free air time most people ignore it. That is one of the weaknesses of democracies.Proud to be Canadian!! :)Lmao the alien question at the end! Fucking came out of nowhere. Awesome lol.Some time stamps would be niceThat last question!!! LMAOI’m glad he went on Rogan, but another opportunity has been lost to ask him for actual details. Not a single hard question. He hasn’t said anything new here.Trumps turn!Joe didn&#39;t once correct Bernie&#39;s incorrect notions on guns and gun shows...IF he&#39;d stop coming after guns more people will vote for him.Bout damn timeI get why people like trump, i get why people hate trump. I really struggle with why people &#39;hate&#39; Bernie. The genuinely wants better for all Americans and AmericaIf healthcare is free what happens to the quality? Sounds good...not practical...also was he on sleeping pills? I know he is tired but holy shit man wake up this show is prob your best chance to reach new votersJoe Rogan&gt; all tv Networks!About as poignant and fact based as the Hotep Jesus podcast.This is the first comment ive ever posted after years of watching JR. If you believe this thief will provide any buffer to he world, then you have come a long way away from where you started. This man is a fraud. Bernie has never created a job, or opportunity for growth in any fashion. My ears been when thi sperson tells wallstreeters how economics and finance works. Somehow he knows economic and human behavior after living a lush life and providing nothing. I say we start by assuming the wealth of politicians rather than instituional investors and retail investors who have been assuming the risks all these years. Bernie only talks of how we may eradicate growth and completely destroy any progress we have in this country. Hes a fraud and JR knows it. Atleast vote Tulsi, if anyone. Socialism kills, and the purpose of socialism is communism.One half of one percent on a million dollar trade is $5000 Goodbye to you 401kHas Bernie done DMT?Me and my father have always disagreed on politics and he has always been a huge Trump supporter, which is fine but he was being so close minded to Bernie due the stance of democratic &quot;Socialism&quot;. He&#39;s always watched JRE daily so he watched this one with me and he actually opened his mind because it was joe asking the questions, someone who he respects and admires. This episode could very well put Bernie in the White House.Agree with his policies or not, Bernie Sanders is one of the few politicians with consistency and integrity. Everybody from all spectrums of society whether rich or poor, Democrat or republican, progressive or conservative always complain about corrupt politicians all the damn time. One of the few politicians who is not at all corrupt is Bernie Sanders. There is a good chance he will never be president but it is undeniable that he popularised the progressive agenda in this country. All the current Democrat nominees freaking copy his &quot;radical&quot; ideas. Whether they are good policies or not he definitely cares deeply about the well being of the average American citizens and non citizens.Whenever Bernie speaks about minimum wage I cringe. Because bernie is a guy that doesnt pay his campaign staff the minimum wage he advocates for, $15 an hour. His staff is actually walking out on his campaign because he not only cut their hours, but also called them out in the news as babies and mostly what they are getting for working in the campaign unable to feed themselves. Ironic...I&#39;m not gonna lie every time I&#39;ve seen Bernie on TV or in the media he always comes off as a quacky or just hits on anti-trump talking points but in this interview he comes off really reasonable and I&#39;m a conservative but I do agree with him on the fact that some of the nations priorities of what makes our nation great needs to change.Wow this is awesomeThanks Joe and Jaime and other individuals that participated. Get different candidates Republican, democratic etcUnsubbedJust got a pharmaceutical add on here. Shocker.no gotcha questions FeelsGoodManBERNIE BERNIE BERNIE BERNIE BERNIE WOOOOMan, Bernie talked a whole lot but I&#39;m not sure he answered one question straight. It seems his answer to everything is &quot;It&#39;s free!&quot;. Paying more taxes in a lower bracket is the opposite of free.ALRIGHT THATS IT. Joe Rogan is now the official interviewer of the presidential candidates.You are a part of the Legislative Branch Bernie, you can basically make the FDA more efficient or defund them.  We could deregulate the system and allow people to buy drugs outside of the US, and not have to go to a system that will destroy our economy.<br /><br />Lobbyists and money don&#39;t get involved into other countries&#39; power matrix?  LOL spare me.  Money and power influence politics everywhere.We could switch to hemp that would help with climate change<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Rogan2020">#Rogan2020</a>This was so great.  What a great conversation, and some really, really good questions from Joe. I feel like I could tell Bernie was impressed by the questions and the things Joe brought up. Questions Bernie probably doesn&#39;t usually get or many never gets.  I remember when I first listened to this podcast nearly a decade ago to hear Dave Foley when this was a pretty low-rent operation (no offense).  Now - Bernie Sanders, Dr. West, Tulsi, all of these incredible scientists and scholars, in addition to amazing comedic guests...This is clearly the future.  Not just Joe&#39;s show, but Joe is lighting the way for the future.  Great Job, Joe.Finally Joe Rogan brings in a real life CLOWN! 🤡Joe Rogan is helping to change the world by providing us with this podcast!!  awesomeMainstream Media&lt;                              <br />Great job Joe.Sanders says that years ago the working people raised up and demanded that employers could no longer work us 15 hours a day.  Meanwhile, he works his campaign staff up to 60 hours a week for a measly $36K.  They complained and he offered to pay them more but contribute less toward their health insurance.  Then he told them he would not pay them more and that they need to get all the work done in only 40 hours when the workers finally complained to the media.  Eventually, he mostly gave in when the publicity got bad enough and gave them a raise and supposedly cut their hours to no more than 50.  Now the union needs to keep an eye on the slippery bastage to make sure he does not use volunteers to make up for the lost hours.  (Why does a socialist exploit volunteers anyway?  Talk about greed.)Ben shapiro vs bernie sanders would be a pretty interesting interviewJoe usually asks good, pointed questions to play devil’s advocate. That’s why he’s good and fun to watch people from different sides. Tonight, he just gave Bernie slow pitches. Garbage interview.Free 😂😂😂😂 He Didn&#39;t mention the huge tax income increases of the middle and working classIt’s been five hours and not even half a million views. This better blow up later.wow, i am officially off the Trump Train, Bernie all the wayThat s raging moron seems to think that my hard work seems to somehow belong to the rest of the world, oh my fucking god. He understands absolutely nothing about how blood, sweat, and tears work. This system he is promoting is proven to be a failure. It does not work. Read a history book for fucks sake.Bernie is in the 1% club and he got $51,771 in Social Security benefits.  You would think he should get zero social security benefits since he is in the 1%Bernie, Happy Acres called.Thank you for doing the right thing Joe. Seriously. Bernie 2020.Bernie is so full of shit!  <a href="https://bernieiswrong.com/?fbclid=IwAR3EkW-udbTQ5ngxhuosG-ECe6R6g1jSmm12DYSLqpCRygt3sGHlvTQep-A">https://bernieiswrong.com/?fbclid=IwAR3EkW-udbTQ5ngxhuosG-ECe6R6g1jSmm12DYSLqpCRygt3sGHlvTQep-A</a>Bernie is going to rebuild The Chicago projects. It will be awesome 😎Sucks to see so many people indoctrinated by diseased capitalist-culture in the comments. Nothing here is radical guys. As an Australian I can:<br /><br />- break my arm, leave the hospital fixed and pay nothing with no interest rates<br />- get free counselling for 12 weeks <br />- afford rent at a home 30 minutes from the CBD <br />- get a University education <br />- won’t be locked away for 2 years for smoking pot <br />- not worry about being shot at my school <br /><br />This isn’t utopian. Change can happen if we all work together.Bernie Sanders for President or bust. PeaceBernie speaks truth to power. The only politician pointing out regularly that it is MONEY that has our government hostage. He’s been saying it for decades. He has my vote and my programming skills.Soooo many dislikes. This is rigged lmao. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RussianTrolls">#RussianTrolls</a>Holy fucking shit<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23makethrowingcommiesoutofhelicoptersgreatagain">#makethrowingcommiesoutofhelicoptersgreatagain</a>Easy questions and not pressing him to explain his non-answers... this is embarrassingThis is the best platform and place for these candidates to speak. Great job Joe!Joe get TRUMP on!Bernie is so damn awesome.Mice die in mouse traps because they don&#39;t understand why the cheese is free  - same thing happens with socialism.  Bernie is a joke.  He makes his money in capitalism and keeps complaining... Yes the economy will always have its flaws... But to sit there and to say out country is in trouble now is the height of ignorance... Nobody cares about you Bernie...Very enjoyable episode and Joe clearly sees eye to eye with Bernie on most of these issues. I&#39;m incredibly impressed how well Bernie can explain these issues. Glad he had him on the show.watching and listening to him layout his case and ideas for 1 hour is exponentially better than watching these candidates cram everything in a couple minutes in debate circuses. invite them all joe and give 1 hour each to lay it all out to america.Feel the Bern. 🔥Trump voter here.<br />This was...good.Um Bernie there is a tax on stocks and bonds?Kanye looks weird.  Also, almost everything he said about Canada&#39;s health care system is false...<br />Now get President Trump on!!Students - Take out big loan buy BITCOIN. All debts will be forgiven if BTC fails.PLAIN &amp; SIMPLE.  THEY CAN&#39;T FIGURE OUR WHAT&#39;S AFTER INSTAGRAM... Think about it....Disappointing joe. This guys commie scum. Unsubscribed....Wow, he&#39;s on JRE ?! Awesome !Love this man.Awesome!!! Joe got Bernie to say he would tell us if aliens and ufos are real if he becomes president!!!Vote for Bernie!!!i counted the other day, out of the 248 total mass shootings there were in america this year alone, 73 of them were in 3 locations. Chicago, Baltimore, and California. we also have the lowest threshold to consider an attack mass shooting at 4 victims where all other countries vary on higher to much higher standards. there is no consensus on what is a mass shooting. 175 is still a lot but i didnt count any other thug shootings like tallahasee or new orleans mass shootings because i dont know all of the gang related cities in this country.Hire this manOH MY GOD YESPeople can&#39;t get $15 an hour if their jobs are automated away though...How many of the 270+ mass shootings have ended because of a man carrying his own AR-15/10 or AK47 stopping the shooter? I’ve grown up with guns (Alabama) and there really is no need for assault style of weapons. The 2nd amendment was wrote to protect people not enable shooters. It was wrote with rifles in mind that has one round mag and takes 5 minutes to reload, not a rifle that fires 45 rpm with 100+ rounds in a mag. The argument I hear mostly is they are for protection... from who? I used to think I was fucking terminator too when I owned AK47, AR-15 and AR-10 etc. but they really serve no purpose other than I liked them. Everyone thinks they can fend off a military invasion attack like the movie Red Dawn but in reality have a box of ammo locked away freezing up in combat. In 2019 you have drones that can take over entire cities in an hour and a AR15 will not do jack shit to a military APC. I’m not saying confiscate guns but SOMETHING has to change. We are the only country in the world with this problem because we have more guns here than humans.Joe rogan should host his own debate on his podcast with all the candidatesBernie needs to be back on for a 2 or 3 hour show. I know he&#39;s busy, but this is such a good venue to have a conversation with someone who is asking the questions of the average person.Try to Bring on Donald trump lol that would be interestingQ WWG1WGA!! Bernie the clown sanders.Bernie - &quot;99.9% of gunowners would never go around killing people, but we all have to make consessions.&quot;<br /><br />99.9% of Muslims do not commit terrorism. Should we all throw them out of America? Or register them by having them wear a yellow crescent moon?<br /><br />Bernie the idiotThank God Eddie Bravo wasn’t invited...I’m not as liberal as Bernie but I put a lot of stock in his genuine beliefs. He’s one of the few that’s in it for the people.Only Joe could do this interview. While being an Alpha Male and a flawed person like the rest of us at the same time, blows my mind that i&#39;ve heard him called &quot;Alt Right&quot;. He considers everything, and he&#39;s smart.We pay more for prescription because the Democrats for the last 5 bills that have come to the floor that would have MASSIVELY lower drug prices, You Bernie, Cory Booker , and 193 other democrats fought against it because you receive contributions from those same drug companies.Healthcare is a privilege. If you educate your yourself enough to provide a service to an employer, you will obtain healthcare insurance. It’s not Society or governments responsibility to provide you healthcare. I agree we have to regulate pharmaceutical companies more. Bernie has been in Congress for more than three decades, and has accomplished nothing! What makes anyone think it would be different if he were president?Go Bernie Go Bernie GO!! Reppin&#39; VTOnly clicked on this video to dislike this socialist sjw conman.<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>Hats off to Joe for not being a shill and offering a platform for the public to get more than a fuckin elevator pitch for very real fucked up world issues.I lost faith in bernie when he let Hillary advance instead of himselfWe are all a bunch of pussies because many people know all this shit yet no one wants to fuck shit up with meI just want to see Steven Crowder and Bernie have a conversationGet Bernie a drink you fucks a glass of water would due.. have some courtesy I have never 🧐Good job Joe.Dude WHAT ARE THEY EVEN HOARDING MONEY FOR? I really...really don’t understand the concept of gross money hoarding...PLZ if someone can enlighten me to a possible idea of what the purpose of sitting on trillions of dollars...I prefer logical and not illogical answers lol (Eddie Bravo reference)Bernie&#39;s platform: Give the Nation State more money and control.<br /><br />Genius lmaobernie been listening to future.. going for that lean voiceOnly thing I can agree on with this old saggy nut sack is I wish there were a way to make health care free for everyone but I just dont see how it would ever be &quot;free&quot;. Tricare doesnt cover shit for vets. My whole disability check goes to medical billsGreat podcast. I personally prefer Andrew Yang, but Bernie does make a lot sense.Joe you totally dropped the ball by not asking Maynard enough questions about the new Tool album. But I&#39;m really glad you kicked arse with Bernie. After all, it&#39;s almost as important as Fear Inoculum. Almost. :DThis was good for the country.I&#39;m a pro-life independent, but I&#39;m able to overlook some of my disagreements with Bernie because of his record of integrity. If it wasn&#39;t for the issue of abortion, I&#39;d feel a lot more comfortable supporting Bernie and the Democrats but it&#39;s a dilemma for me right now.This really goes to show how useless tv news segments and &quot;debates&quot; are. Mainstream media should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. And then they act &quot;holier than thou&quot;. Give me a fucking break.5 hours in 500000 views but I haven’t watched it yet...😋Thanks for pushing back on all those non-answers, empty platitudes, and generic responses, Joe.Let&#39;s have all presidential candidates have airtime on JREDude if he gets trump on the podcast I will shit myself legitYes, the climate is changing.. It is always growing warmer or colder but it has nothing to do with humans.. The more I listen to Bernie Sanders the more I am convinced that his ideas are dangerous..Colleges need to cut there administrators. They almost outnumber the teachers.Only an hour?I can&#39;t stand Bernie, but you gotta admit, this was a big booking by Joe.Rogan should&#39;ve asked this bum about his endorsement of the Venezuelan system of government. Also this idiot talks a lot about private interprise for someone who&#39;s been in government most of his lifeThanks Joe and your 5.9M subscribers, vote🔥🔥🔥Bernie 2020🔥🔥🔥People need to educate themselves in the fact that the people are the true leaders, you pay these political establishments to govern for the better of the people....and what we have is a bunch of treasonous corporations and politicians running purely for profit.... own gain, (drinking from the same fountain)<br />When will people worldwide wake up and see that the only way to bring National sovereignty is to stand up and say enough is enough!?I&#39;ve yet to see any real argument against any of his points in the comments 😂 y&#39;all really are the lower half of the iq bellI wish EVERY candidate would go on Joe Rogan, including President Trump. Whether you like Bernie or not, gotta respect him for doing this interview.As an Aussie with healthcare/Medicare it blows my mind how there can be people in America(literally everyone) who don&#39;t* actually understand the concept/what they actually get with free healthcare.....Bernie Sanders tax form =   Line 1: How much did you make?    Line 2: Send it in!You have my voteBernie is a babbling socialistBernie Doesn&#39;t mention how people literally come from Canada to America for surgeries because it sucks so much ass there (BUT HEY, AT LEAST IT&#39;S CHEAP!)Bernie/Tulsi/Yang deserve support.Bernie is the only solid contender. Period.  I lived in NY 25 years ago and he has never wavered in his stances.Communists don&#39;t have points or principles; only pretenses meant to enable their crimes.<br /><br />The US is meant to be free.  You can&#39;t exchange freedom for security, or anything else of value.  Regardless, anywhere else on Earth it may be an appropriate discussion, but it objectively doesn&#39;t belong in the one nation on Earth meant to be an oasis for the only rights that exist, individual rights.<br /><br />Communists, go elsewhere.  Take a globe, spin it, drop your finger...  If it lands anywhere but the US, party on.  Best of luck to you.  Those of us who value Liberty have no where else.<br /><br />It is simply inappropriate for communists to be in the US..  in fact, it is criminal.Bernie doesn’t stand a chance because he is too articulate and reasonable for America. That’s not what the US wants. What they REALLY want is Kanye West for Pres and Nicki Minaj as his running mate.Fucking whacko, I&#39;d love to debate this clown on a national stageBernie should have got high. He has no idea of how business works. Just charge everyone. Drink some cough medicineBernie Sanders is God.Get Trump on here Joe!Senile Commie prickThe only way this podcast could have had more credibility was if someone (for instance Thomas Sowell) was sitting there to call BS on Bernie Sanders. It has been done in the past (for instance the Twitter interview when Vijaya Gadde had Tim Pool to check her on her BS) it should be done more often.Fuck Bernie socialist mother fucker and his delusional followersI wonder if the amount of Democrat candidates coming to the JRE will be a net positive for R or D. I imagine JRE skews Republicans  so these candidates are getting a new audience. However, I feel like Bernie Sanders will bring a lot of Democrats to JRE, which end up listening to more Republican aligned schools of thought.If by any chance  he got in corporate America and the top 1% would do everything in their power to make him fail. 98% of what he says is awesome. Joe gave a great interview.Joe Rogan now has more clout than all the day time and night time talk shows in the world combined.One question for you joe...   did he inhale?He should have asked him why the last season of Curb your Enthusiasm sucked so badI used to think he cared about poor people. I realized he is just jealous of the rich who earned it outside of politics. <br /><br />We defeated you during World War II and then again during the Cold War.  We will again in the 2020 election.Now this is epicSo why is the suicide rate in Vermont 35% higher than the rest of the country??<br /><a href="https://vtdigger.org/2018/06/10/vermont-suicide-rates-far-outpace-nations/">https://vtdigger.org/2018/06/10/vermont-suicide-rates-far-outpace-nations/</a>Go Bernie, fuck the rest.Mueller On Joe Rogan podcast. LETS GOOOOOOOOI&#39;m glad I got to hear Bernie more depth. He just won my vote 2020So when is part 2 and 3 coming out?So turn doctors into slaves and aggressively tax the very people that employ you. That&#39;s the ticket. We need more rugged individualism in this country. You are responsible for the decisions you make. I am not responsible for your health or your well being. Just bc you live in this country doesn&#39;t mean you deserve to be comfortable. People don&#39;t deserve shit. Individuals need to be held accountable for the decisions they make. You don&#39;t reward bad decision making with government subsidy. This man is the epitome of communism. He speaks in a fairytale. It doesn&#39;t work.Is this even real life anymore? I seriously question it. Who would have thought Bernie Sanders would go on JREI am not American and do not live in America but now I understand why people cried after JFKs assassination. <br />It is powerful and emotional to see a politician so passionate who speaks SENSE and has revolutionary (for america) ideas.<br />I also love this inside voice Bernie too! Though I also love outside voice Bernie haha.<br /><br /><br />For a generation of americans, 2020 is do or die. <br />And for the entire planet, 2020 could help us slowly put the brakes on our own destruction or keep our foot on the gas.<br /><br /><br />Go Bernie!joe get  AOC next. let&#39;s see what she has to say.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BERNIE2020">#BERNIE2020</a> Medicare4All And Free CollegeYoooooooI was hoping Rogan would bring up the Seth Rich murder &amp; how Hillary &amp; the DNC stole the nomination from him in 2016.

Keep it up joethis FAIRY TALE  just Cannot  justify 70% of government spending“Nothing Radical about that now is there”. <br /><br />Bernie Referencing the 30Trillion dollar idea He pulled out of His ass for free healthcare.I really don&#39;t want to listen to this because this guy is a tool and I disagree with everything (?) he says. but... I also think I&#39;d be doing myself a disservice to not listen.Could be the first president in diapers.I’m really glad Joe was finally able to get Larry David on the podcast... not as funny as I thought it was gonna be tho...Glad to get a serious, principled, and honest conversation with a politician that&#39;s longer than 45 seconds. Loved what he had to say tooThank you for this Joe and Bernie 🙏<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=20m36s">20:36</a> I&#39;m down with that idea Joe mentioned. It&#39;s fair.Does Bernie answer a single question that Joe asks??? It seems like he just danced around every single question and didn’t give a straight answer to anything.Just here looking for all these Russian trolls everyone is talking aboutI think his ideas on paper sound good , but in reality it will not work without taxing me or then average American insanely. Plus wanting to take away ar15s which is not an &quot;assualt rifle&quot; get the hell out of here I have mine for protection whether it&#39;s from a burglar or tyranny. Good luck is all I got to tell you if you choose that route.LMAO @ Joe Rogan trying to suggest paying younger people a lower minimum wage for the same amount of work as their older colleges.I was 17 when i chose my universityBERNIE 2020!!!!!!!!Oasis making machine (machine which kickstart a micro-climate)<br /><br /><br />In order to counteract climate change, I designed a machine which create an oasis (trees, water) in most types of climate, even in the desert. <br /><br /><br />The machine is composed of an open top sea container that has been modified to deploy a chain of custom-designed fabric/hemp bags (around 500 meters of bags). These bags contain mushroom cultures and various seeds of trees, grass and scrubs of draught resistant species. <br />Once the bags are deployed out the sea container, the bags will remain connected to the container. The door will be shut and it will be filled with water and lung fish (type of catfish that can survive without water for up to 5 years). It will be used as a kickstart for the system. <br />Then, to finalise the installation, a web of fog catching nets will be installed on top of the sea container in order to provide a daily replenishment of water which will percolate within the fabrics of the bags and activating the seeds. <br />This system does not require either maintenance nor electricity and the fish can survive with insects falling into the sea container, providing nutritional values to the water. <br /> <br />This system is using physics and mimics nature to create a machine that can self generate water out of thin air combined with the existence of the lung fish already inside the sea container.<br /><br /><br />The system works better if placed on top of a slopping terrain but works also on any type of terrain and climate. <br /><br /><br />Here is a link to see what it will look like in 3D:<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/X--vJsrQIzA">https://youtu.be/X--vJsrQIzA</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here are also a few videos to explain some characteristics of the machine. <br /><br /><br />inspiration for the bag deployment systems<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTZscYmBXco">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTZscYmBXco</a><br /><br /><br />example of fog catching efficiency <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsNNp9N2v9Y&amp;t=319s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsNNp9N2v9Y&amp;t=319s</a><br /><br /><br />lung fish characteristics <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYPzK-fDWDs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYPzK-fDWDs</a>Read charles dickins you can&quot;t leave people  to rot it will affect the wealthy  they will have to live in castle and the sewers will poor in to them it won&quot;t end well   .he&#39;s correctGood interview Joe.  This was definitely the quietest call for revolution by Bernie thus far...but still a call to a revolution.  Dudes been in office forever and has not done shit to improve anything, nor have most politicians.  I will never ever vote for Bernie or any other Democrat...never ever...everI wonder how long it will be before someone looking to discredit this hour will focus on the fact he said America was fighting China after pearl harbor its a small mistake but media just blows everything out of proportionI wish they did a 3hour interview =)I only came here to see the dislikesJoe really went pussy cuck 5000 on this episodeWant money out of politics? End citizens united restore the fairness DoctrineHe&#39;s got my voteThe man is a saint, a bunch of dumbasses disliked this.Too many people that need Bernie have bought into the propaganda of our mainstream media.Bernie has the worst posture I&#39;ve ever seen. I know hes old but god damnThings are better than ever before in human history, despite Bernie&#39;s btching.All of those dislikes must be from Shapiro and Crowder fans lolBernie isn&#39;t being real here. From the beginning he defends keeping the debate power in the hands of CNN and MSNBC.  Why are they running the debates?  Why is Don Lemon and Rachel Maddow given any power in this election?YESSSThose of you that listen to Joe, if they raise the min. wage to $15 you will DECIMATE  the American workforce.Joe should’ve passed Bernie a joint. If he did the Bernie would have 2020 on lock lolRespect for this one, Joe.I agree that we need improvement but, you literally praised Venezuela as the IDEAL form of &quot;democratic socialism&quot; and we all see how that turned out. We used to have health care lodges in America that drove the prices down and then government stepped in on behalf of the doctors and prices skyrocketed how is more government going to lower the cost? It seems like every sector government touches the price goes up. Government offers more and more tuition money and every year the price goes up for college yet quality hasn&#39;t improved.This dude Sanders is scary asf, he can’t be for real.Leftist like Bernie has destroyed countries around the world. Tens of millions have die from his type governance. Now he wants to do the same for you and your children and there children.Trump 2020!Get Bernie Sanders hooked up with Elon Musk.A weapon cannot fire without ammunition. Restricting the sale of ammunition to individuals who carry a specific license (which can be revoked if/when they encounter the law) can be an effective way to manage the existing weapons holders out there. Sure there are people who have ammo stocked, as well as the ability to create their own ammo, and the edge case where a non licensed gun owner/ammo carrier steals a weapon of a legal citizen. There will never be a 100% solution, but if you can cover 60-80%, I think that is better than nothing.Yang, Bernie, and Tulsi. Progressive coalition let’s go !!!!How the bloody motherfudging fiddlestix is this not trending ?I feel the burn🔥🔥 Burny2020bernie  did not say that he supports making trade school tuition free, but i read somewhere that he didHe has tons of good ideas. NO practical plans.Joe wants weed legal @  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=45m28s">45:28</a>left is the worst！Thanks Joe for a sane political format. I don&#39;t always agree with Bernie, 2nd Amendment mostly , but I truly his ideas are very morally grounded and see through the smoke and mirrors the the corrupt elements or our society presents . He has been the major political force for a new generation that has been left outside of the main stream media conversation that actually represents this country.This dude will almost be 80 IF elected. No thanks senile old man.The 46th president of the United States!!! Thank you for having him on.Bernie if you would stop trying to give people free shit and support the 2nd amendment I might vote for you...I just imagine this being Joey Diaz&#39;s calm granpop.Now get DonaldNow we wait until Trump inevitably comes on...Can someone do a comparison with what the old communist said in Europe at the turn of the century and what Sanders is saying now.you give those victims in new zealand guns in their hand and tell me the outcome wouldnt be different. criminals are criminals and criminals dont obey the law. you do a buyback they dont care, you ban any kind of gun criminals will keep theirs and the innocent will lose theirs. our country is different from others because we have so many guns, but you put the amount of violent cases up to any other country and we are all generally the same. guns are for self defense and you will never take away the peoples right to defend themselves, i dont care how great of a smooth talker you are the general population isnt that stupid bernie. and joe you know damn well youd have a fit if he got rid of your guns, so dont come at him with a weak pussy-foot question like that on something youre so passionate about.Imagine President Bernie Sanders coming on JRE to announce the aliens are realBernie seems like a fearful person. Not a leadership quality. But who knows, anything can happen.How is Joe Rogan, a stand up comedian and MMA commentator doing a better job interviewing Bernie on policy than any fucking journalist ever?joe rogan has and will continue to change the world.I really wish Joe Rogan asked him about technology taking over jobs. Not really discussed much in politics, but if you heard of the trucking business being automatized, it&#39;s scary and sad to see millions of jobs go.Joe Rogan does a better interview with Bernie than any Major Network. The long-form discussion, unedited and uninterrupted is the best way to understand somebody&#39;s ideas. There is no way to be derailed by false-appearances perpetrated by false editing or gotcha questions asked quickly... Long form discussions allow the ideas to be articulated and clarified so that there is no misunderstanding.<br /><br />Anybody watching this, whether they agree with Bernie&#39;s ideas or not (or even are morally opposed to them) will have to admit he&#39;s a great guy who is sincere about his love for people and is intellectually honest about his positions.<br /><br />I hope Joe Rogan interviews EVERY candidate for President, even including Trump himself.Don&#39;t let this clown lie to you about &quot;free&quot; health care. Most people in Canada are on private health care, and the ones who aren&#39;t are waiting 3+ hours to see a doctor for their cold. What a delusional prick.Ahh I was hoping for like a 3 hour one, but I am sure he had a stiff time restriction. Great podcast though, thanks for getting him on Joe!Why doesn&#39;t Donald Trump wear glasses?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Because he already has 2020!99.5% of pills swallowed are unnecessary.Here is a current example for  Bernie the dickhead...I had a spine injury.. my private work insurance was great...all drs accepted it.... I now have govt medicaid ins....  only 1 out of every 50 spine surgeons will accept that ins cuz it pays next to nothing.....u think i am getting a good spine surgeon  now with medicaid? I am lucky I even found one.... reform private HC.... if we go govt HC .. u all will have the same issues I am having... Don&#39;t believe me.. google surgeons,  and see how many take medicaid... My pain clinic where i get cortisone shots told me to go find another clinic cuz of my medicaid ins.... the one I replaced it with sucked so bad , they could not submit proper paperwork to get me approved for shots... I just gave up...Bernie &quot;I just talked to someone and they said, &#39;Bernie,&#39;&quot; SandersI love how how he speaks up for gun ownersCan we get Trump on the podcast?Bernie makes a whole lot of sense, there is no denying that. Nice work again Joe, keep bringing this shit!complete clown filled with negative energy do not put this man in any position of power at all&quot;assault weapons&quot; are already banned.Currently at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=32m47s">32:47</a> but just want to say you&#39;re the man Bernie realest politician in this corrupt system.This podcast has become biggest influencer in usBernie: Do you know how much college used to cost back in the day? Virtually free!<br /><br />Joe: How much does it cost now?<br /><br />Bernie: I don’t know 🤷‍♂️Could you imagine Trump coming on Rogan&#39;s podcast? Now THAT would be entertainingTrump2020Powerful move by Bernie!Bernie.  Love ya.  Please add UBI to your platform.  It is the &quot;magic lance&quot; that you don&#39;t have.It may seem counterintuitive, but I really appreciate the honesty of not having all the answers. Joe is right, it seems an impossible job. You have to depend on so many people and outside factors, meanwhile any failure falls on YOUR shoulders. Nobody has all the answers, because it isn’t a one-man job. I hope we see more of these interviews with candidates here because it’s hard to drudge through the real debates where nothing is really ever said, at least nothing that gets throughJoe Rogan , I highly appreciate the fact that you have this man on your podcast. I always learn a lot when you have these people onInterview Noam Chomsky.I more of a Yang Gang kind of guy, but this podcast sheds a lot of light on someone I&#39;ve seen as a delusional socialist. Turns out Bernie is a well-spoken and thoughtful/reasonable person, hardly the screaming socialist I see portrayed on TV. I want the debates to be held on JRE from now on. This shit is just absolutely illuminating.You should worry about education since your wife embezzled 10 million dollars. How many students would that have helped?The fact that Joe Rogan can do this and make (lots of) money PROVES there is a market for long form in depth interviews of our political candidates. We need more of this.What is Bernie talking about? Healthcare is rationed in countries like Canada and the UK.Oh Bernie don&#39;t think he had a job till age of 52 maybe he collected welfare and lived off a couple of diff woman and how&#39;s he a millionaire geeee I wonder things that make u go hmmmmI actually am beginning to like Bernie. He has some good viewpoints!Hopefully Bernie comes back soon, this felt kinda rushed at the end.I don&#39;t agree with Bernie. I think it sounds good on a surface level but doesn&#39;t agree with reality when you really dig into things. But I&#39;m really grateful for the opportunity to hear him express himself in long form. People want this, not sound bites that go all the way around questions in a glorified reality showWhat is bernies definition of an assault rife? Any rife?this video is the reddit homo&#39;s wet dreamThe Man who’s a millionaire, flys on private jets, great healthcare, protected by guns..wants you to be “equally” with everyone except politicians...the Government will give you free healthcare, free childcare, make the US fix the worlds climate problems, free housing, free food, free education, pay back all of your school debts..sounds like a Magical liberal Utopia..I’m in!!!!Thanks Joe.  I&#39;ve been waiting patiently for this.  Unless the billionaires kill this guy or steal another primary, you just talked to the next President of the United States.... this interview is a joke. He doesn’t give ANY solutions, and Joe doesn’t ask proper questions. Fucking joke.This was one long infomercial. I mostly agree with Bernie but if you have paid attention to Bernie Sanders in the least, you know you’ve learned nothing here.The American public deserve a health system. I could not imagine being in A&amp;E and worrying about the bills more than my health.Damn. He actually got Burnie on the podcast.I wonder what Joe’s friend Alex Jones thinks about this podcast 😂. Really glad Bernie came on this podcast and got a fair chance to put forth his ideas. Definitely better format than all mainstream media.Weird how Bernie could barely look Joe in the eye.China doesn&#39;t keep people in jail.they kill them.usually days after their trialI didn&#39;t find his answers and reasoning as compelling as I once did. I guess learning more about free market economics and conservative values will do that.Joe only has dems on..Wonder why..11K dislikes under 11 hours52K up 10K down not bad.........diseases of dispare  is a big thing. The rat in rat eden doesn&#39;t use cocaine and doesn&#39;t develop an urge to shoot up their neighbours either.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m36s">1:04:36</a> we were at war with Japan not China. China was busy being broken.<br /><br />Ok carry onRussia has treated the American political system like a vulnerable Windows 95 computer, Moscow Mitch has disabled security updates, and Donald Trump is both compromised and in denial.Could I have my money back, Sen. Sanders? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DNCFraudLawsuit">#DNCFraudLawsuit</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SheepdogBernie">#SheepdogBernie</a>cant stand bernie, his voice is so gratingnot even fuckin around bernie sounds like hes gonna croak on this podcast lol thats the one reason i see him not being elected president. he seriously sounds like hes on opiates as raspy as his voice is mine does the same shit, and lookin at his posture and back i bet hes poppin them thangssss boi haha ✌Bernie might not be perfect but if we are to beat the oligarchy currently manifesting itself in our government we need to do something, something effective, something fast, something now.Joe would sell his mama for 5 $Who would of thunk it, that a former fear factor and UFC host is changing the world with his podcast.  <br />Keep it up champ.BumpI&#39;m conservative and believe Bernie would be a great president.  The American people have been fleeced and brainwashed and allow these billionaires and corporations to get away with murder while they exploit the working class.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=42m48s">42:48</a> what would u donefrightening ......... big brotherAs someone viewing the United states political state from a foreign country, and as a long time JRE fan. This pleases me greatly, enjoyed Joe&#39;s questioning line and his subtle encouragement to probe a more detailed response from Bernie. Now I would like to hear a Republican candidates interview as well, and would hope Joe try to keep as much bias out of it as possible :)Wow, Joe is really a shitty interviewer. It&#39;s like he put no effort into studying the subject and has no real reply to any answer because of it.As a trump voting conservative, I found this very compelling and thought provoking. Sad that the far left progressives/identity politics get tossed in with a lot of the serious issues that Bernie brings up here. Solid podcast JoeJoe is a book burnerHe is against the 2nd amendment and even proposed an assault rifle ban... i.e semi automatic rifles.New York City has gone to a  $15 an hour minimum wage. Businesses have had to fire employees, cut hours and to close there businesses. Same thing happened in Seattle. Pie in the skyCould you imagine if Redban was on this episode?The amount of people who disliked this video simply because they don&#39;t like Bernie&#39;s ideas is shameful.Love the long-form talk, we need more of this. I may not be the biggest Bernie bro but its still good to see him try to talk and explain his policies. Heres hoping you can keep doing this, Cheers JoeHow bout we get Bernie in office and Yang as Vice President? I don’t have any problems with this.I’ve never seen Bernie so calm.  Like Bernie or not, Joe let Bernie explain himself and didn’t time constraint him. This is an example of why Joe’s show is relevantBernie Sanders: Talks<br />Joe: Let&#39;s pull this thing in <b>pulls it in</b>Why didn&#39;t Joe ask about kids being transitioned when Bernie said 0-4 years of age was important considering Bernie panders to the trans community like every otherI fucking hate communists on my streetsdopeAbsolutely the best medium for Bernie to get his point across in detail. Great great podcast! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FeelTheBern">#FeelTheBern</a>Ill pass on that socialism BS12 YRS. ...THAT&#39;S SOBERING.Bernie just rambles tbh. Hard to follow him, his message is so unclear. Maybe im dumb, you tell me.Why not millionaire&#39;s like you Bernie Obama bailed out the top ten of the top ten percent.  Why go to college.  Trade school Bernie.  Trade school.Bernie genuinely CARES. Regardless of where you are politically, you know that he genuinely cares about this stuff and about human beings.Fuck Bernie Sanders.Feel the bern &lt;3We should have political debates on the Rogan podcast.There’s something about Bernie I like.In 2016 I was on board with him but he really, really lost me. Massive Hypocrisy: doesnt pay his staff 15 bucks an hour but campaigns for that minimum wage. Calls Trump out on Baltimore narrative, but calls it 3rd world himself. And on the other hand he regurgitates the same old talking points of ridiculous, empty promises and hysteric climate change propaganda (12 years.... yeah right). Tulsi and Yang offer real solutions and are actual principled people.Sanders says he does not know how to solve high pharma prices, but the obvious steps are to make it cheaper to get a drug approved and vastly reduce or even eliminate patents.Bernie, Still thinking the people are going to be able to stay ahead of the learning machines. This is not 1970 anymore. We have AI writing code for itself and other applications. We ha AI performing manufacturing at the Atomic scale. We have AI outperforming medical diagnosis by doctors and technicians and pharmacists.  We have bots building bots.  Its replacing lawyers and paralegals. Accountants and book keepers. Self driving cars and trucks is going to throw millions of people out of work over the next 10 years. And retraining them is not going to work for these new jobs. The skills gap is too large and we are horrible at retraining. Ever tried to learn a new language? Imagine learning 3 at once.Could joe get Trump on?Fck commiesFuck both of these losers!Where does the money come from? The rich? Look and see how much the wealthy in America (USA) has and what you can pay for by taking more of there money? How much do they have to give to be fair? Then ask yourself if you would give the same. When you get into the numbers many of these ideas fall apart.This man needs to be President. Great episode10k people disliked this interview. You weren&#39;t listening. You didn&#39;t even watch it.The burden of an increased minimum wage is heavier on small businesses. Further consolidating power/wealth AND accelerating automation replacing humans. A sewer of bad ideas this man is.Fuck u joe you selloutAlways liked and admired Bernie’s policies.....the best thing about him, that separates him is that I BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SPEAKS.  I can’t say that for others.Andrew yang&#39;s UBI pretty much solved 95 percent of  Bernies problems.Voting Democrat is like voting for the ghost of Joesph Stalin. No thanks!This just goes to show that televised political debates are a joke. Joe Rogan does a 1000x better job mediating a discussion than any t.v. debate i&#39;ve ever watched.The problem is Bernie jumped on the &quot;Racist train&quot;.Get Rogan to host debatesSocialism ruins nations and destroys economies, you can&#39;t have communism without socialism. Bernie is a career politician and knows how to sugar-coat a turd and call it candy, his policies sound nice but will give government complete control, cutting off the free market, raise min wage causing much higher taxes and mass unemployment which leads to higher crime and poverty rates. America will snowball into a 3rd world country within a decade, There will be no middle class; only the ruling class and the &quot;undesirables&quot;. Going socialist is not the same as switching between republic and democratic, once a nation goes socialist and the government takes over you don&#39;t just vote your way back in a few years, you&#39;re locked in.Those who don&#39;t know history are doomed to repeat it.Joe is wearing his &quot;white house suit&quot; as always..This is cool. Joe can be such a true platform to educate the world correctly (I’m not a Bernie supporter, but to hear him like this was awesome)Wish Joe asked Bernie about why he endorsed Hilary the last election.This guy is so full of shit that I want him to get elected just so everyone finds out the hard wayHoly cow what a coup for JRE to get Bernie right now, regardless of your view on him.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=33m30s">33:30</a> umm those questions are already on the universal background check that is required to purchase all new firearms everywhere in the usa<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=40m00s">40:00</a> what about the nuke drills you did as a kid? those had no impact?<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=42m00s">42:00</a> and i&#39;m done trying to listen you bernieJoe, you should have asked him why his wife took 10 million dollars from the college she worked at and is under investigation. Why don&#39;t you ask him why he drives an Audi R8 and gripes about rich people. Why don&#39;t you ask him why he only paid 18% income tax overall, or why he was not paying his campaign employees less than the $15 dollars an hour and then cut their hours so he could look like he was paying them the $15  bucks .  Such a liar and hypocrite.This is crazy! Its a matter of time before Donald Trump shows up on JRE.  Eddie Brazo will be the co-guest or co-host.  Along with Alex Jones and Bob LazarMan wth, what could this possibly intelWAY TO NOT CHALLENGE HIM ON ANY OF HIS GENERALIZATIONS.  NO SUBSTANCE TO ANY OF THESE IDEAS.  HORRIBLE KISS BUT INTERVIEW.  MAKE HIM EXPLAIN THE &quot;HOW&quot;.  WHAT A JOKE PODCASTIt happened...<br />It finally, FINALLY happened...<br />I&#39;m impressed 👏👏👏the best part about Bernie is that he&#39;s honest and humble enough to say he dosen&#39;t have all the answersA Stalin sympathizer is surprised and upset that people think he cozies up to dictators lolHeck yeah, Joe! Get more candidates on! Youre better than todays journalists!Crazy world we live in.bernie sanders andrew yang all day everyday hustling to get paid.. trying to make a million dollars.. fuck minimum wage..Bezos worth 150 bil !?  Good for himBernie is dancing around the topic of corruption: politicians actively work against the people because the supreme court decided political bribes are free speech so politicians work for the entities which fund their privately-financed election campaignsI am European, and the fact that these ideas are considered radical by some is astonishingMy respect for both Joe and Bernie went up this cast. Soley based on the rarity of a civil political conversation. This is how it should be.Joe should moderate the debatesYay Socialism!!!Feel the burn! Love Bernie, its amazing how many broke Republicans are out there sticking up for corporations that couldn&#39;t give a shit about you.Bravo!!! You diid good RoganGuy litterly can’t even make eye contact. 90% of the time looking at the table. Body language of a BS’rBernie &quot;I can&#39;t believe&quot; SandersI think he&#39;s an alright human being but I&#39;d never vote for him. Still way more than I could say for Harris, Clinton, and most of the others.YES!!!! YESSSSSS!!!!!! Thank you Joe Rogan!!!! GO BERNIE!!!! Bernie Sanders will be the president 2020 and Bernie will straighten out the nation. As long as he doesn’t touch guns he’s a 10/10 for a presidential candidate!Bernie says the government is rigged and corrupt and yet he is fighting to have the government control everything now. Anyone see the fault in his logic. A smart person would say hey we need LESS government not more because all the government does is fuck shit up!!The libertarian, Sharpe?, Joe had on called him a democrat.  Joe thinks he&#39;s a libertarian because he doesn&#39;t understand what rights are, what libertarians are, and the nature of government.<br /><br />Unlike other self appointed labels, &quot;libertarian&quot; actually means something.  You can&#39;t accurately just call yourself a libertarian and have it be true.  You must adhere to the Non-Aggression Principle.  Joe objectively does not.  He is a statist, albeit a relatively reasonable one.<br /><br />He is absolutely not a libertarian.i&#39;d love to see trump on hereYup, Bernie is still a crazy socialist. Nothing new.<br /><br />This was painful to watch.Do Trump next! 😏Bernie said his wife promises to tell us about aliens when he gets to the office. A vote for Bernie is a vote to reveal those damn aliens. Now we dont have to go to area 51 later this year. Thanks bernie for saving lives!feel the burnIf he&#39;s going to pay for health care and pay for college, why does he need to raise the minimum wage?<br /><br />Pandering to the struggling middle class.👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁👍🍁Hope he asks Bernie about the Bruno incidentThe 1999 Columbine Shooting happened during the Assault Weapons Ban era.Bernie actually makes a lot of sense.  Too bad he is never allowed to make his case in a detailed way as is given here.Sanders is a communist.Damn.. Was hoping for Alex Jones.I love that Bernie&#39;s heroes are FDR,  and Harry Truman.Joe secretly is interviewing all the candidates to give them a chance to speak that would be awesome!Thank you for this. This is what we need. A long form conversation to see who people really are.He’s not wrong but, he’s saying some things that trump is doingHe never looks joe in the eyes. Shifty ass mudafukaWhat exactly is an assault weapon? All semiautomatics? No it&#39;s the drugging of 6yr olds.when I was a kid we had rifle teams in the school.President Bernie Sanders &amp; Vice President Joe Rogan 2020Taking guns from legal people isn&#39;t going to take them away from criminalsif this old kook can somehow win the democratic vote, it’ll be an easy win for trump!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2020">#trump2020</a> baby!!Everyone needs to come together whether Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal or independent and tell the President that his words have consequences and he needs to act like a mature adult but his Cult followers just believe everything he says even if he said the opposite the day before! What happened to conservatives and republicans when they used to say &quot;what would Jesus do&quot; to &quot;grab her by the pussy&quot;?I was with him right up untill he said assault weapons how ever i think he is not aware of how effective non assault weapons are in comparisonWhat about the debt that I have paid down?Alllllmost had me Bernie. Get fucked you&#39;re unrealisticNothing is FREE Bernie.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m45s">1:04:45</a> &quot;With China&quot; You mean Japan?No FUCKING WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fuck YEAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!You should to a hole series of every candidateNo wonder so many americans living in thailand etc and seem sio happy they left<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a>Some of these comments are pure autism.Okay listening to Bernie talk about Canadian health care is rather funny. He leaves out that the outrageous drug fees that are not covered, and also leaves out that the average person in Ontario (possibly all of Canada) pays 54% of their wages in taxes.. hence its not free health care not even close. Gov just takes control of your money instead of you doing it for yourself.Let me save all you some time. The most important question is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m00s">1:07:00</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m41s">34:41</a>As someone who fundamentally disagrees with Bernie on the majority of issues, this was a great podcastAwesome podcast! Share it people, share it!Can we get Trump on JRE!?Talk about Lockeed Martin Uncle Bernie, talk about that overpriced peice of junk jet you lobbied to have built in your state, talk about the schools your wife got bonuses to bankrupt  ahahahaa bahahahahajajajaja<br /><br />Old corrupt foolPolitics shouldn&#39;t be in our LEO departmentsI want to like Bernie but he talks in narrative and hardly answers the questions. He talks like a snake trying to seduce you. In his mannerisms, its unsettlingDemocrats can&#39;t really check data and statistics. I&#39;m republican and I&#39;m here to watch this podcast and look if anything make sense and evaluate. Most Pharma issue I completely agree. The opposite is not true, democrats close their eyes to data and arguments. A 12 gauge shotgun is far more effective to kill than rifle. So start with rifle (less used in shooting by statistics), than ban shotgun, after ban 10mm, 44mag,  45acp, 40, 9mm, then 380, then 32 acp, 6.35mm, then 22 caliber, then knives, baseball bat then cars, at end you will still have evil people running cars over people and they will figure out 500-3m people defending themselves with guns are now just victims where state can&#39;t provide security. And 32k cases of suicide will still happen. What about start with the problem from the beginning? Fix mental health and the culture that create sociopath criminals and let the gun do its job on good citizen hands?They should have Joe Biden and Tulsi gabbard on.no single person can fix this country’s problems we are setting any president up for failureYa let&#39;s tax to death!!! Give free college, what about the debt that I have paid. No bankruptcy cannot remove student loan debt, there is no collateral.Why do you americans call white supremacists  who shot and kill dozens of people a mental sick person and DO NOT call people from middle eastern who also kill many people the same thing ???? Why guys  white are always sick and others  are terrorists ??? The problem starts here don&#39;t you think ???Bring Trump on now!!!A comedian and a politician all in one, that&#39;s my Larry DavidWow He just mixed up China with Japan.Definitely 45 seconds isn&#39;t enough to express the candidate&#39;s views. Thanks for doing this Bernie and Joe. Joe -Please consider doing a podcast with all democratic candidates.joe..... plz bring him back again to talk more...tv debates are a joke and ARE only soundbites....we need to be informed .....joe ....your podcast is more important than you know......keep doing what you do best ...don&#39;t let your success change you...Bernie Sanders helps me believe in humanity<a href="https://youtu.be/NjlC02NsIt0">https://youtu.be/NjlC02NsIt0</a><br />Dan Pena climate changeBernie: All good with Canadian public healthcare and yes your heart surgery would be free... except, you probably couldn&#39;t wait 1.5 years for it. That&#39;s the small part nobody mentions: No incentive - no trying hard. US healthcare insurance system, on the other hand, is basically legalized gambling, where the house always wins, because they hardly pay out, even though they collect the premiums from everyone. Each system has MAJOR issues.Also it is illegal to buy 12 guns in a gun store and sell them to felons it&#39;s called a straw purchase. Also it would generate a multigun sale form that would be required to be sent to local sheriff s department. The problem is they don&#39;t go after and prosecute straw purchases for some reason.... And the sheriffs departments are politically motivated for their party not the people that elect them! So they don&#39;t comply with policys and laws put in place by others parties, or because the law or policy is unpopular to your party.. that&#39;s not right!!I don&#39;t know where Bernie is getting his numbers on child care perople making very little money.  Parents pay over $1,000 per month for child care.OH SHIT IT’S HAPPENINGWhat a great interview Joe. Informative and respectful. Thanks.The healthcare system in Canada is a shit show and its not free and average wait in a emergency waiting room is 6 to 8 hours just to see a nurse and its not free healthcare a Canadian citizen pays 30 to 40k in taxs to pay for the <br />&quot;FREE HEALTHCARE &quot;It takes months to get a doctors appointment in CanadaHis trading tax is beyond ridiculous considering he&#39;s passing down the tax to regular people. If he proposes a flat tax it&#39;s going to hurt regular everyday traders/investors. There should be exceptions on private investors.Man I wish someone would take my hard earned tax dollars and spend it on free college and healthcare for other people, also there aren’t enough illegal immigrants entering this country to share our limited resources 👌🏼Bernie 2020 2024 yang 2028 2032.Half a million views in 5 hrs... not bad i guess 😏Holy Shit!!!P.s. healthcare is NOT right Bernie. If you lived on a deserted island would healthcare still be your right? Just because you keep saying it doesn&#39;t mean it will ever be true.ask how how he intends on paying for everythingTheo Von for Vice PresidentJust here to remind you that taxation is extortion.I like the idea of a President that cannot be bought!  You may agree or disagree with Bernie, but he is honest.  He is true to his beliefs, and his voting record reflects those beliefs.   I like the idea of a leader representing the people and not beholden to money.what a great interviewIt’s easy to elect a socialist, but it will take a revolution to get rid of it. Please don’t bite this worm America. Back in the day I chose my health care from my employer, it was free! Motherfuckers!! But you have to read English to understand, oops!Here in Brazil we have a Political Obligated time, on TV during elections..<br />Wherever channel u watch on a specific time for Half Hour (Twice a day) gonna play the Partys program, without cuts, edition, and advertising.<br />That also happens in non-election periods, but not everyday, more sporadically and for less air time.<br />Granted by Law.I can feel my brain cells dying from hearing Bernie speak this longBERNIE 2020Bernie seems to think we fought China In WW2.. lmaoWhy it’s not trending?😣Whilst I don’t agree with a lot of senator sanders policies; I am glad he came on and was able to speak freely. We need this open discourse in today’s political climate if we have any chance of getting out alive.&quot;if you look at what&#39;s going on in other counties...&quot; gawd forbid a u.s. politician looks at what&#39;s going on in the the U.S.A.  !Human hearts need to change.The only politician that makes any damn sense. Love this dude.Great interview even though I think his ideas are pure bullshit that will cost everyone tons of money and just run most corporations out of this country.The &quot;green new deal&quot; and &quot;squad&quot; is not the pinnacle of liberalism. Bernie and Tulsi know how to enact progressive policies, progressive in tech and policy, I as an aspiring pilot/mechanic hope to see electric vehicles forever!There’s no doubt in my mind that the 11k dislikes are from people who* didn’t even watch 20 minutes of this interview. So ignorant lmaoThe minimum wage should be $20 based on inflation. Period. And to try and say kids work these jobs is ludicrous. Kids are in school, studying and then sleeping at night not working. The majority of people in these jobs have families and take care of parents and kids. You pay the middle and working class a living wage and that boosts the economy FOR REAL not tax cuts for billionaires.I&#39;ve never clicked on a video fasterThis is a relief from the political theatre that is MSM debates.Get Trump on the show Joe!!!Rogan is going to run eventually. Remember this comment.It just blows my mind how this guy isn&#39;t president yet. You guys vote for the ones that just want for themselves and do nothing for the greater good.What’s funny is he thinks he will actually be able to change our healthcare system. The people he needs to write the legislation are on the payroll 😂😂😂I dislike Bernie more than anyone. But for fucks sake he came on here for long term conversation, that takes balls, mad props....madddd props. That being said Trump 2020Really great podcast, Joe rogan did an exceptional job asking questions and asking what the typical American is thinking.. how are these things legal? Why are there frequent shootings? And are them aliens real? Exceptional! Bernie will get us that Bob Lazar proof! I want to see them aliens Bernie! LolWhen you have plenty of imported labor. Employers have more opportunities to screw over the domestic workers.&quot;greed is what they are, they want it all so give me all of your monies and let me control how you do business&quot;Great interview! Bernie you are amazing, Sanders 2020Crazy Bernie back with his Communism.Bernie just explained very well how politics in the US is a hugeeee conflict of interest.As a Canadian I can&#39;t say much about the US but our healthcare SUCKS!!! This tells me this man is full of shit about everything else he says. The US brings new meds, doctors and equipment... You guys are the richest! WTF is this guy talking about???Bernie dodged a lot of questions. I think this is why Rep tend to not like the guy. He funnels back to rich people make to much money. I don&#39;t understand how he thinks taxing companies would somehow incentivize them to stay in the country.Im just over 10 minutes in, and I&#39;m already terrified of the guy being president...Although I do not agree with his policy, I have to say I&#39;ve gained a lot of respect for Bernie as a person through this potcastcan’t wait to hear what this old psychotic kook has to say&quot;Ban fully semiautomatic magazine clip guns thingys!&quot; <br />How will u do it bernski? <br />&quot;Well i don&#39;t have a magic wand joe&quot;I’m more of a conservative but I would much rather have this guy in office than a crazy beoitch like Hillary.I dream this moment!Bernie holds so many punches here. And wtf was Joe sticking up for Kamala the Cop?Its not 7.25 its 8.25 n hour shows how much he pays attention an its funny how they all talk about draining the swamp so too speak but notice it never happensI never thought I would be so lucky to see these two people that I like very much sit down and talk about issues that affect so many Americans every single day.Fuck wall street and fuck student debt is what I got from this podcast. Honestly, he has my vote with that alone.&quot;So Bernie, what do you think about Bob Lazar?&quot;Please come back to El paso Bernie I would love to see you. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>Scientists in Finland and Japan found no evidence of man made climate change.I wish Bernie was my grandfatherNearly every single argument he uses is ironically tied back to the easily-debunked Labor Theory of Value.  The double-irony is when he talks about his willingness to subsidize entities that have &quot;high costs&quot; ... DUE TO the dang same exact-type subsidization and state interventions that created it in the first place.WILL TRUMP COME ON THE PODCAST?Finally got Bernie on the show :)If Bernie or Yang don&#39;t win, we all loseTrump is a fake populist: filled his cabinet with a record number of billioinaires, violates the emoluments clause enriching his businesses, typical Republican tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, his estate tax policy, etc. That should be enough, paired with Bernie clearly being far far more informed on substance...Good choice on coming on JRE Mr. SandersNuclear energy &gt; solar/windI feel we could make a change by sharing this.<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>So drug company plus guns disater for UsaLOVE Rogan, such an even keeled and open minded person, Bernie not so much.Thank you Joe!!!What Bernie did not say about Canada&#39;s health care is that the taxpayers pay an average of 43% of income in taxes and the average wait time for surgeries is 20 weeks not including the average 4-5 weeks to see a specialist first.Nvm you did that...This was eye-opening. I still don&#39;t agree with hardly anything Senator Sanders stands for, but it was great to hear him talk calmly and in detail about his ideas. I personally won&#39;t dismiss him as an elderly lunatic anymore. He has clearly put some thought into his positions. I just happen to disagree with his methods, and that&#39;s cool.When the 2nd amendment says that it is a god given right to own a gun it was written in the matter of a human has the right to have the tools to defend him self like any animal is born with the tools to protect it selfAs much as I disagree with Bernie&#39;s trade policy, money in politics is essentially a 1 issue vote for me.  Honestly if there were an honest Republican that wanted to do the same with money in politics I&#39;d probably vote for them.  I am enjoying the focus on healthcare being a new father.Oh my god. Internet.What happened to hard work ethics? We should be help accountable for our own actions. My father came into this country with &quot;Nothing&quot; also spoke no english. In 35 years in this country he learned how to speak english worked his way up with &quot;Low&quot; income jobs, he SAVED his money! Taught his own kids (me) &quot;nothing is FREE in this country, you have to work for it&quot; and now he he is a business owner taught me the ropes and now I don&#39;t work for nobody. I thank him for teaching me this values and much more to type in here.Desperate MAGA chuds making a bunch of accounts to hit the dislike button. Sad!I’d just like to remind everybody that the state of the current administration is still the fault of establishment Democrats due to them not letting this guy get the nomination. I think we’re at the point where we will see him win this election though, if everyone has enough sense.Just saw him live in Long Beach ! 🏖hate how he brought up canada and our healthcare yall got it wrong im from toronto<br />1 you still have to pay for all scripts<br />2 we have a tax on everything to pay it our &quot;free healthcare&quot;<br />3 if you need a specialist could be 12 months before you even get a result<br />4 anytime you show up at emerge or wutever expects hours upon hours of waiting<br />5 been told many times if you want answers go to the states and pay its faster and better<br />6 canada now has &quot;super hospitals&quot; where you can pay if you choose and states just calls them regular hospitals and trust me the results are way faster<br />anytime i hear this argument it drives me crazy its not free, scripts are high priced as well,  bernie doesnt know wtf hes talkingMetaphoric Planet Earth Anecdote (Joins The Chat 9:36 P.M. MST): A small farm runs with little to no regulation, as it expands and the yield increases, variables in said system compound.<br />Human Nature (Joins The Chat 9:37 P.M. MST): The individual genetically programmed through shaping of this said farm wants to thrive, survive, and reproduce. <br />Metaphoric Planet Earth Anecdote: Anyone? Anyone?Omg Joe is doing it right! I’m so happy you continue to have presidential candidates on your podcast. Please have more!FINALLY!!!!I really wish they talked about Hillary and how the DNC was rigged.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=04m10s">04:10</a> It&#39;s called CSPAN. DNC is bought, pure and simple.I know how to get money out of politics...<br /><br />Reduce the size and power of the federal government.Not a bernie fan. I am voting trump, but Bernie came off way more reasonable in this than any other time I have seen him. This is why i love Rogan. Every once in awhile he exposes you to something you would never come across on your own.holy shit grill him GRILL THE MANJust at the start of the video, but in Canada and Australia there are huge wait times for any surgery when going through the public health care system and that may be an issue depending on the type of surgery.Bernie’s cool.  But Trump Maga 2020 🇺🇸Bernie wants to pass legislation that makes tv stations give candidates air time?? Because other countries are better...Wow, reading your comments Americans ....  feels like it&#39;s 1776 .. and actually they were more advanced than you now, y&#39;all feel more like 1376 .... a medieval imperalistic bullythis and andrew yang podcast sre probably my favorite political podcast joe has done (maybe his only one i dont know)Where is Tim Cast? Where are the hardball questions? Why is Joe listening to a millionaire tell him millionaires are evil without calling him out? Why do Americans want another old (oldest) white president? I’m so confused and even more so, I’m concerned about the people who support this type of thinking.In California, all public college and universities (community colleges, CSU and UC) are tuition-free based on three California Higher Education Act of 1965. However, these California  public higher education institutions  started a scheme to charge a &quot;fee&quot; per class unit. If a class  is 4 units, a student pays 4 times the unit cost. Tuition is a flat rate that a California student doesn&#39;t pay but is paid by the State of California to public colleges and universities. The fee a student pays per unit to the public higher education institutions is sent by these institutions back to the State of California and is considered s recovery cost to offset what the State paid in tuitions to these colleges and universities. I believe these fees violate the  1965 H/E Act because students are still paying a tuition though it&#39;s called a fee. Sadly, even if public colleges and universities become tuition free nationally, I believe most states will adopt this California scheme. The other issue that will not allow for a free public higher education is that across the nation student are forced to pay additional fees like Student Association, Health Center, Rec Center, Student Union, Transportation and other fees. At some California institutions these, these mandatory fees combined with unit fees are so high, it makes it difficult for many students to attend these public institutions.Fantastic interview, killer job by Joe Rogan, challenged Bernie multiple times, always fair, Bernie also nailed it, made a great case for himself, very excited for himWow if only we had someone this smart as president. Imagine the possibilitiesBernie is a genuinely good man. I question the integrity of anyone who dislikes Bernie and would not trust them for a second.Trump will win again. As a vet, my experience with the VA has been a nightmare and I know its exactly what Medicare for all would be like. In top of that, taxation is theft, and he would essentially destroy the country with his ubsurd tax hikes. The American people will do the right thing in 2020 and vote trump in again.Funny Bernie&#39;s is worth millions.This is what I don’t like about Joe Rogan. I don’t expect him to push back on every plan but some of the points he has previously disagreed himself about, he didn’t push back on them.The only way you get healthcare costs down is to limit the salaries of doctors and reform tort laws.  Every country that has universal healthcare have a cap on salaries and legal judgements.  Salaries and hospital costs (including tests to cover our ass legally) are by far the two biggest costs.And whose fault is it for the current healthcare climate in which companies make billions of dollars? ACA? Started by Massachusetts. Encompassed by the Feds and mandated to all citizens! <br /><br />Talk to the DNC about that one.What a nutcase Bernie is, comes across clear as day<a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-dumbing-down-of-america-by-design/5395928">https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-dumbing-down-of-america-by-design/5395928</a><br />☝That article mentions the oligarchs, like Trump, who do not like/want grassroots movements.  Bernie Sanders have also mentioned majority of what the article mentioned as well.  You Bernie haters are fools.Man this guy is such a downer. How can people dig this stuff? All I hear from him is for us to accept being poor. Success is evil. Keep our heads down, and work for an evil corporation so he can tax the hell out of us so corrupt politicians can have more houses.Right when firearms came up, and Bernie&#39;s stance was military &#39;style&#39; weapons, I lost all interest. It&#39;s okay to say you dont understand firearms, it really is.Joe, I think you may have very well changed the course of history with this podcast - I cannot thank you and Bernie enough for shedding light on such important issues that we all face as human beings on this earth. Thank you.You might have just got Bernie electedBernie has been chewing the same mouthful of food since at least 1989.Jamie pull up Bernie doing bong ripsBernie smoking Joe Rogan.Hahaha Joe asking about Aliens had me dying 🤣Depraved people can create bombs like they’ve done in the past too, guns don’t kill people, people kill people.Boring<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m40s">1:07:40</a>. Ok, now get President Trump on here Joe. Trump 2020!not into politics at all, but what a smart move for bernie to utilize this platformMedicare for all or mass immigration. <br /><br />Pick one.I really want Bernie and Yang on the same stage at some point.I really like Bernie but Yang seems to have a better understanding of the modern economy and some of the unintended consequences of things like a $15 minimum wage.This man just said in &quot;some cases&quot; it&#39;s literally a lifetime.<br /><br />He just said &quot;some people are getting their SS checks garnished because of student loans 😂😂😂😂😂<br /><br />You mean to tell me someone graduating college in 1976 hasn&#39;t been able to pay off a student loan? Get the fuck out dude.Great to see Bernie on the podcast...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>YANG GANG 2020</b>great jobThe joe bros are upset, poor snowflakes.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=25m00s">25:00</a> JR asks Bernie how we&#39;re gonna pay for certain things. Bernie just goes on a hyperbolic chat about income inequality but never answers the question. THAT is the problem I have with Bernie. Good ideas, but no view on how to execute.my brain is still in recovery mode from taking in so many high level important ideas.Damn the last question about aliens was legendary Joe! How about Joe Rogan for president 2020! Also, as a sidenote I am going to be on your show by episode 2000!It’s just crazy that one of the biggest talking points is always about taxing the rich but what about all money the government already gets in taxing everyone. It’s not a money issue we have in America it’s a greed problem we can keep letting the government keep taking more but until we fix the greed problem nothing will ever change. How long has Bernie been in politics what are his greatest achievements? Besides him living a comfy life and telling people that are struggling what they want to hear just so they vote. It’s just not Bernie it’s all career politicians and city officials we as Americans need to hold them accountable and make sure we see where the money is going besides their pockets and if they are greedy and corrupt they need to be held accountable. Example look at the education system billions have been spent on it but yet only the people in charge have gained from it.The medical field is run by drug companies and medical equipment sales. But yet Bernie, you take massive donations from drug companies and you voted to defeat a bill that would have lowered all drug prices, why because you are on their payroll. It&#39;s right in your campaign filings. Liar.This is the return to long format interview, at scale: Almost half a million views in 4 hours. Well done, sir.BERNIE 2020🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥After listening to this, Bernie just sounds like Yang lite. He had the same belief about money and corruption in politics as Yang, but doesn&#39;t seem to have a solution. He also doesn&#39;t acknowledge the 4th industrial revolution destroying the most common jobs in the country, which $15 minimum wage just makes WORSE for poor people, not better<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=58m45s">58:45</a> That is the answer I want to hear from every person who runs for president.Damn! The number of dislikes in just one day. Seems like JR&#39;s podcast has been in serious need of an exorcism, no one better than Bernie Sanders and Cornel West to perform it.ugh 1 hour?????Bernie &#39; I wrote the damn bill &#39; Sanders 😊Good good good, go Joe! Doing a fine job getting these informative conversations rolling.Tax exemptions come from government incentives, ex. Providing housing, Jobs and community services are types of government incentives. Companies may also get taxed on the final income take rather then there total year income.This video has been played 476k times, good!pretty sure CHINA was not responsible for Pearl Harbor.  Blends well with his boasting on public education.  Yang 2020The decline in wealth for the middle class started when we let China start to rob all our jobs and factory’s. 30 years ago.Nice guy. A very unintelligent communist, but a nice guy. 😂“Assault Weapons” 🤦‍♂️👎<br /><br />The Department of Defense isn’t buying semi automatic AR-15s.... they are buying actual assault weapons like the M-4 which LOOKS like an AR-15 but is select fire (semi auto or burst/fully auto).Sanders Gabbard! 2020 together we can create a better future!Bernie &quot;I talked to a person&quot; SandersAnytime Bernie goes on a rant it looks like he is going to implodeOMG!  Joe’s really bringing his audience up to speed on important issues.  First Cornell West, now <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>!   You’re really raising the quality of debate Joe.  Thank you. 🤜🏼Get poor people out of America...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m03s">47:03</a><br />Marijuana aint  HeroineBernie is a con man that sucks in naieve teenagers into supporting tyranyThe only candidate. Bernie 2020Really wish that you had called him on more particular issues and had gotten Bernie to give details that back up his positions. It sounded like a very smooth political talk with a good vibe that lacked actual substance. Bernie has been a political animal for a very long time so he definitely knows how to talk some good political game. <br />Now you need to land a Trump interview!!! And also whomever the best 3rd party candidate is. Please<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=40m10s">40:10</a> I was never scared of school until after Columbine. <br /><br />We have to figure this out. Bernie is right.Bernie is for the people. you gave Trump a chance, at least give him a chance.  These gentlemen are REPRESENTING us, our family&#39;s, and our morals. I don&#39;t agree with everything, focusing on free energy, fixing tax laws and regulations. Senseless oil wars. Focus on environmental issues and humanity issues. Coexisting???? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TeamMusk">#TeamMusk</a>Have to say. I think Bernie is the most reasonable candidate weve got. Great show man as usual.Look at all the money that Walgreen&#39;s Pharmacy makes and where it goes for example. The gross profit was astronomical in what they made and charged the Insurance company&#39;s, or if you didn&#39;t have insurance and paid for generic azithromycin out of pocket. If you worked for Walgreen&#39;s the employee discount was 13% above cost meaning you paid .01 for your whole script. great deal. didn&#39;t work there you were paying over 5 bucks a pill. or they charged the Insurance company 25 dollars a pill.Most of the deaths by shooting involve handguns like pistols, a ban on &#39;assault weapons&#39; would not do much. Plus what is an  &#39;assault weapon&#39;  all weapons are assault weapons?I am so scared...After watching this podcast , Nd comparing the podcast with Andrew Yang, there both quality candidates. But I got Yang. He is all about the numbers , Nd number don’t lie. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23UBI">#UBI</a>1hr? Come on Bernie this was your chance.Trump next please!!!!Go Bernie!!!! Let’s see if the rest can followSorry, Bernie is an amazing politician and has done excellent work but he is NOT what the US needs in the way of a president. “Better than Trump” just isn’t good enough. We need radical changes and we need it now.Where them conservatives at! <br />⬇️Thank you Joe for doing this interview!!I can’t believe these people don’t know that HIPPA LAWS are the ones that hide medical records for the mental ill people this is why they can work anywhere or even buy a gun HIPPA protects them because they want them to fit in2012 Sen. Bernie Sanders had $80k in credit card debt, 2019 Sen. Bernie Sanders is a multi millionaire who owns 4 homes and multiple supercars....actual track records matter !Great interview. This gave me a more deeper understanding of his policies and agenda than any MSM outlet could haveIt&#39;s disgusting that Biden is still polling ahead of Bernie.joe on his fucking A game for this oneWhy can&#39;t Bernie say &quot;human&quot; properly.  Kills me&quot;&quot;white people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot; -BS<br />once you play identity politics, you lose my vote.Oh Grampa Bernie... You had me right up until &quot;could care less&quot;.  It&#39;s &quot;COULDN&#39;T&quot; care less.  And now you look dumb like me (cause I used to say it).  And I&#39;d DEFINITELY never vote for me.The difference between Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang is that Yang has numbers and projections and Bernie just makes promises he won’t keep.<br />Andrew Yang 2020The top 1% has as much money as the bottom 98%... And???... The value of money is nothing more than what the people give it... If you take their money and redistribute it, does the common man get richer???... The fact of the matter is than injecting more money into system does nothing but inflate the dollar.  When everyone has more money, the dollar is less valuable. With more money people are willing to spend more for the things they want.fuck... as an australian listening to this (so i cant talk at all, our country is fucked) this man is just leagues apart from the muppet you have in office now... wtf is going on?What I heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=48m15s">48:15</a><br />Bernie &quot;pssshti bet you can&#39;t cough me out ya biiitch&quot;<br />Joe : &quot;I&#39;mma try&quot;<br />Wish Bernie would hotbox with B- real!Fxck that old bolshevik dipshitYangGangWhy the hell are you interviewing that communist, did you ask that fraud if he voluntarily paid the amount of taxes that he would impose on the rest of us, want to bankrupt America in less than two years, then vote for that Stalin loving POS .Nice work Joe. Kept the Burns honest and it was great. I can’t stand the pandering bs on tv. Do more of these! Get Tulsi Gabbard!Very interesting episode. Bernie seems very trustworthy, unlike other politicians.We need a change, Bernie seems to be the solutionUnless welfare recipients get the same hospital room, same surgeon, same wait for an MRI, then universal healthcare is unfair! The Congress people will never wait a month for an MRI! It happens in Canada all the time! Those who can afford it go to a private clinic to avoid wait times.He&#39;s an anarchistBernie doesn&#39;t sound crazy in long format. If he does this throughout his campaign on big platforms he might have a chance.<br /><br /><br />BTW Bernie, wind and solar energy is just as damaging as fossil fuels! Extremely large portions of land has to be cleared for windmills and the ONLY work when there is wind. The chemicals used to produce solar planes and their batteries are extremely dangerous as well. Waste disposal for the solar route has been a problem from day one. Lets get some better ideas here please..Bernie took Joe&#39;s $ after the podcast..Norway nationalised their oil companies and have a trillion plus kitty for their future generation whereas the UK who had the same access to the oil privatised it the UK are over 1.9 trillion in debt, anyone that thinks socialism and communism are the same thing needs to go back to schoolGuys. He&#39;s insane. Insane old man.This podcast makes me wish 2 things 1) That it was longer and 2) That all of the candidates would do an interview in this format I learned a lot about Bernie and his views and I feel like this format could be a great tool to help votersIm posting before watching. I cant believe what Im about to watch. Wtf! Bernie 2020.Every time the mimimum wage goes up OUR HOURS GET CUT and thats if you dont just get laid off or not hired in the first place i mean do people even think things through anymore?I say the debates should be a bracket system two candidates per debate.Bernie gots my vote for 2020.I love your show Joe Rogan and look forward to hearing your opinions on all things u give us. I&#39;ll keep an open mind even though he may not be able to accomplish a quarter of it, if all is so and he wins...listening thoThat was some powerful shit. How can you not love Bernie? He&#39;s a once-in-a-lifetime Candidate and we deserve him after the absolute embarrassment the Trump &quot;Administration&quot; has been to what America is supposed to be about.Bernie is so full of shit.😂 should have asked why he kissed queen Clintons ring after she fucked em.If college is free, literally NOBODY will take it seriously! There’s no risk. Horrible idea!! <br />   The price should be massively reduced, but never free.I see Bernie sanders, I hit dislike.Bernie wins...<br />Joe: oi, &#39; wink, wink, nudge nudge &#39;<br />Bernie: Bob lazar is no liar.<br />Joe: load blownFollowing Bernie’s “logic” food and clothing should be a “human right.” Hmm centralized government control over industries 🤷🏼‍♂️what could go wrong?Can’t they buy the guns online?TY Joe... this man should have been president right now.  Makes me pissed thinking about what Debbie Wasserman-Shultz, the DNC, and Hillary did to him... Still pissed. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FeelTheBern">#FeelTheBern</a>!!!Its a gun problem in usa 100% not rocket scienceJoe must be trying to lose viewersThe flood gates are open now. All the other democratic candidates be in Joe’s dm’s now like, “hey wyd.”I&#39;ve noticed all the bots on here, you avatar less poster&#39;sWe can do a buy-back program for guns, offer a better deal than private buyers. Totally optional.This nigga can’t even wipe his own ass how the fuck he gone be presidentWhat your plan for all the people who already paid there student loan debt? You can join the military and have free tuition.  Or states where they have free tuition to sign up for trades all long as you work in the state for 5 years.I highly doubt a JRE podcast with half a million views only have let that 5% of comments total. And most of them only good referring to Bernie. I call bullshit. <br /><br />Every comment is commending both of these guys when normally it’s split or even against how Joe goes back and forth.  And don’t tell me for a second, that Bernie has no haters on here. <br /><br /> Censorship?Does Bernie have a secret $50 trillion dollars lying around that he&#39;s not telling us about? How ya gonna pay for all this shit Bern!?I agree with him of pretty much everything except guns. I shouldn&#39;t need a license to buy a hammer if a person hit someone in the head with it, I shouldn&#39;t be banned from buying a scary looking hammer, Assault Weapon is a made up term, SHALL etc. But spot on for everything else.Not a huge Bernie fan at all but I do appreciate him making time to come on and talk.Why is it only student loans get forgiven, but my medical debt is just fine?The quietest I&#39;ve ever heard him talk.Internet = BrokenI believe in healthcare for all. What I don&#39;t believe in is raising my monthly cost $40 and raising my deductible from $500 to 4k. Thanks affordable care act!Bernie Sanders is just not president material The soldier from Hawaii is way better.This guy scares the living shit out of the establishment.  And he has been fighting against them his entire life.  <br />Thanks Joe for hosting him.This is the first podcast I watched the whole, nice oneSanders seems to be making the point that Medicare For All would be affordable because we would not have health industry profit.  But Sanders said the pharma profit is $60B, from what I can see insurance industry profit is around $10B.  This is a tiny fraction of what we would need for universal healthcare.  This amount is barely more than what we already pay in Medicare fraud and waste,  Even if Sanders lied and said we would need only $1T for universal healthcare, this is less than 1/10th of what we need.Bernie needs to hit one of Joe&#39;s 15.9% Blunts.&quot;The quality of care is as good or better....&quot; <br />BULL FUCKING SHIT!!!!! COMPLETE FUCKING LIE!!!<br />That&#39;s why the Canadians FLOCK to my state to be treated!!!<br />BECAUSE THEY DON&#39;T WANT TO DIE WAITING!!!Great interview. I believe Bernie meant &#39;Japan&#39; rather than China about the potential war in 1941 though. Keep it up, Joe! :)Bernie loves to talk big, but he doesn&#39;t have many practical solutions. Hes been in politics for looks like a century but I&#39;m not seeing much success.I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get flack for this but something Bernie should also consider is our pharma companies do most of the heavy lifting for the rest of the world when it comes to developing new drugs. <br />US pharm companies spent 71billion dollars on research and development in 2017 while the whole of Western Europe (not just one nation) only spent 10billion.<br />So our companies develop the drugs using our citizens capital then the rest of the world can replicate based on our research. They can automatically undersell the US because they didn&#39;t have to invest the upfront capital. So in a pretty direct way the US subsidizes the world&#39;s health care.<br />I&#39;m not saying we should withhold research or that US pharm companies shouldn&#39;t trim the fat on their prices because they should, 71billion for R&amp;D is only 21% of sales (not profit).<br />I&#39;m only saying the issues are much more complex than Bernie is letting on.Joe has to have President Trump on the podcast before 2020.  Make it happen Joe.I&#39;m thankful this went the way it did. Great interview. I&#39;m still not sold on him and probably never will be. BUT, I gave him an honest shot. He&#39;s not evil, just misguided. That&#39;s my honest opinion on the man. ✌<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=20m40s">20:40</a> I&#39;m with Joe, Bernie isn&#39;t with that. That&#39;s one of those unwilling to compromise things that turns me off Bernie.Joe...ask how much this costs, man. There&#39;s a tradeoff to everything. The population of the U.S. alone could bankrupt us by lowering the Medicare age. Let alone letting the government -- the same entities that run the DMV or the Veteran&#39;s Administration -- run something as critical as national healthcare.Trump 2020Love how I got a trintellex add 15 mins into this as he’s talking about big pharmaBernie is full of shit ! To do all that he wants to do will cost way too  much , monetarily, socially and in just about every way possible !! The worlds been ending and climate been changing since the beginning of time !!  For every scientist for it there is one against it !!  I laugh out loud if you actually think the world will end by weather in 12 yrs  !!Trump 2020“BUY MY MARIRAWNA” lolWe can&#39;t bailout wall Street, and neither can we go make education free, and neither can we go to huge wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and possibly Iran. Most people who say we can&#39;t afford public education, healthcare etc. Don&#39;t think we could afford the wars or the bailoutsLover Bernie! <br />But Andrew Yang &gt;&gt;&gt;NeverFix the economy and watch the mass shootings decline.Bernie Sanders: The millionaire socialist<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/tsFB1AERBmA">https://youtu.be/tsFB1AERBmA</a>Y&#39;all just gonna ignore all the crazy shit spilling out this dude face?? I&#39;m pretty sure the MAIN goal of big corporations isn&#39;t to get regulated, so they can pollute the water and air. This guys plans will send us into a never ending hole of being broke!Bernie wants to guarantee healthcare and a higher education for you and your children. The dude has a long track record of fighting for everyday amercians.&quot;Highschool diploma isnt good enough anymore&quot; well why dont we reform highschool to make it more technical. It would force colleges to lower tuition because people would be able to start a life right out of highschool.the state of American healthcare is so sad, even simple things like my $7 a month eczema cream costs my American friend $300 for two tubesSoftball questions 1) the 2nd amendments most important aspect is protecting from authoritarian govts...so is ge planning on taking assult weapons and military equipment from police to prevent eventual mass murder that tends to happen when a not so nice guy eventually take the reins ...so short sightedWe got knife crime but gang  problem mostly but still nothing crazy like jthe usa but would be if we had gunsTrump 2020Only podcast from you that I’ve dislikedHol up Bernie&#39;s voice is D E E PWho in America is a stable person?&quot;We&#39;re not living in the best possible world&quot; So trueTrump 2020Hey kids in high school! Listen to Bernie around 31 minutes. If you make the mistake of going to college... this will be your life.Joe &quot;I Understand&quot; Rogan speaks to Bernie &quot;literally talked to a person&quot; Sanders ... who wouldve thought.stop clearing your throat. im easily distracted.Awesome.  Bernnie you legend <br />Sadly they won&#39;t let him win <br />People are dumb and the crooks are too powerful <br />If he did e in they would assassinate him in the first monthBitch ass Bernie Sanders deserves to eat bullets! FUCK DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST!HEALTH CARE IS NOT A RIGHT. Benjamin Franklin would punch this goon in the face, he owned a hospital. What a nightmare, and people are even listening to this just shocks me.Trump 2020!I’m gonna ride Bernie Sanders down the ol town road ima gonna ride that Bernie till I can’t no moBullshit full auto guns  are not legal this guy is such a lying piece of shit Trump is going to smack this guy into  the ground.Trump 2020Bernie is nut. Free health care? Pfft please.Uggghhh Bernie cmon man I was totally with u on everything n talking bout weed 1 sec like fuck yeah he gets it. Literally the next sentence it&#39;s like okay well what about atleast decriminalizing all drugs n just his instantaneous nooo made me audibly sigh. I just dont get these politicians who can understand why weed should be legal n he even said expunging criminal records for people who not jus had weed but sold it and how we have more people in jail then anywhere else but then 1 second later be so against decriminalizing other drugs. The common misconception is that hard drugs being &quot;legal&quot; means it would be encouraged. They think ud buy herion at the store n more people that would never try it b4 would do it now just because. When every1 agrees there is an opiate epidemic how many more people could be even be on dope? If ur gonna expunge records for selling weed, which u should, how can u not also see that sending people to jail for putting substance in their own body is just absurd. You can never win the war on drugs n if they truly wanted to stop cartels n spread of drugs on the streets they could absolutely do something about it. If u believe addiction is a disease n u wanna treat this epidemic n there are 2 many people in jail why r we still arresting people for possession of drugs? I&#39;m not talking bout some huge trafficking operation where ur selling 2 kids. Im talking bout the addict who goes to work to pay for their habit n u catch them with a small amount they were getting for themselves how u could be okay with locking a person up for harming themselves. At the same time there is a bar or liquor store in every town in America n cigarettes are legal when essentially its the same thing people buy self destructive substances to change their state of mind or temporarily feel good. When r we gonna end this fucming charade that putting people in jail for doing drugs is somehow bettering the lives of every1 in America.Dam I wish when Joe was asking Bernie about the good weed, he woulda pulled out a spliff and had him take a puff.Bernie really makes crushing poverty for all but him sound nice.Sanders/O’Rourke is a winning ticket... taking Texas is key to winning. But aside from strategy — Bernie has the ideas that working people want. Good on joe for having him on for a real conversationBernie is a lunatic but this was a great interview. Thanks Joe.i am honestly watching this with an open mind, trying my best to put my ideals aside and hear bernie out..here goes...if joe respects him..then i respect himDon’t give this socialist a platformSander/Rogan 2020!it is legal joe because THEY make the laws. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m20s">23:20</a>Did Bernie just say he smoke out a couple times??? 🤣🤣.... getting bent BernieBig Dawg 69 - You are exactly right, Lobbyist in Washington run the country and if you think it;s not the case you&#39;re out of your mind.The problem with Bernie is he thinks every business is amazon or McDonald’s or any big company but what about the small family owned businesses my family farms and we will have to let some employees go....Bernie seems very sincere about caring about the people. That’s what’s stuck out for me. I’ve never once gotten that feeling hearing trump.I urge everyone to do their research and take some time to think about what each candidate can do for the American people. Bernie obviously isn’t the only one who wants to help us out in some way or another but universal healthcare will DRASTICALLY improve everyone’s life. There’a this twisted statement going around that Bernie wants to “raise taxes on the middle class.” THAT IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY. Obviously the government footing everyone’s medical bill is going to raise taxes but it will be far cheaper than the current insurance prices plus the bill you still receive since insurance pays fuckall. “I don’t want to pay for everyone else.” Under other circumstances a fair stance, but nonsensical in this case. Private insurance IS LITERALLY PAYING FOR OTHER PEOPLE. All insurance is is pooling the masses money to pay for the people who end up using the insurance. Sorry for the rant but Bernie could’ve and should’ve been president in the 2016. Please don’t make the same mistake America.COMMUNISM DETECTED ON AMERICAN SOILTry to talk quietly to get us to pay attention. I’m paying attention. Take our guns and then don’t let us vote again like Venezuela? Get out of here you filthy Socialist.Long live Sanders!Should have asked why he let that B get away with stealing the election from him....he was complicit to criminal activity!270 mass shootings? It is a lie. Yes many people killing family siblings not random attacks. Yes, it need to be fixed changing what is generating sociopaths instead blame the guns. When ban happen does not impact on crime rate. Brazil has 7 times more crime and no &quot;assault rifle &quot; or &quot;military stile rifle&quot;.  The mental health is the issue.Bernie Santa played it smooth. 19.5 week wait time in Canada for most heath care appointments. USA drug research and development has to be payed for by someone and we are it . Every other country gets free ride. When we do that say goodbye to any new drugs.Hello Bernie Sanders, nice to meet you, what was that question I was supposed to ask again??why does every common sense bone in my body tell me he is right on everythingJordan Peterson x Bernie Sanders PLEASE. Let&#39;s doooo it!Either you did two interviews on the same day or you wear your clothes two days in a row! LOLThe issues discussed in this podcast were the real issues that needed to be discuss, there wasn’t any of the abortion, gay, women’s, minority’s rights bullshit that divides the votes into trying to legislate people’s life.Seems like Joe couldn’t wait to finish that interviewLolHow is the United States the richest country in the world? but $22 trillion in debt? If the US was the richest country in the world they would have a $22 trillion dollar surplus.Suck Focialism 🇺🇸So sick of people using the word free. Healthcare should be free? Who&#39;s paying the doctors? Education should be free? Who is paying the teachers?<br /><br />Also you earned a billion dollars? You should pay more tax regardless of how much you spent to make that money. <br /><br />Take your hands out of other people&#39;s pockets and try making any if this work.He keeps usen canada as an example for a health care system.... they basicly use monopoly money both in how it looks and what its worth...the standard of living is lower the population is lower they have fixed trade prices with us and mega low prices...(trumps tarrifs were ment to fight this i dont agree but facts)his used example here is takin out of context ....do like hearing him just be allowed to talk though i dont agree with him but interesting view on capitalism and why he demonizes it..editing this as i listen...the minimum wage at a single&quot;PART TIME JOB&quot; was never  ment to be used to raise a family his argument his mute point wheather its kids or not minimum wage is ment as a stepping stone to advance your state of well beeing..noticed how joe didnt word it that way im thinkin this is a puff piece i wonder if he&#39;ll bring up Hilary stealing the election from bernieAmazing, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>. <br /><br /><br />This is what a presidential candidate looks like, Joe.NO CONCESSIONS... the politicians are the problem and firearms rights have already been limited too much. Let&#39;s go back to ZERO restrictions if we open up the topic... <br />ARE YOU  READY BERNIE, TO GO TO LESS RESTRICTIVE GUN LAWS? <br />How about the politicians give up all their armed escorts?Simply put,, the reason that pharmaceutical drugs are so expensive is because the United States subsidizes the rest of the world in the price. If you were allowed to buy drugs across boarders the price  would equalize across the planet in short order.. It is collusion between corporations and our government on behalf of stock holders.Get TRUMP on. Best President in 20 years. TRUMP Trainnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. Choo ChooWhere is all the &quot;Jamie, pull that shit up&quot;? Get some stats, not all the anecdotes.Yep..    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fuck">#fuck</a> Bernie SandersBernie sounds very reasonable as he calmly describes massive wealth redistribution which would further drive corporations overseas.i love my man bern but we didnt fight china in ww2 he miss spoke and ment japanHis own campaign staff had to basically strike for him to pay them $15 &amp; he fought it. Once Bernie caved he immediately cut their hours. WTF???!Im english and my country has issues. But damn America is fucked@!! Feel bad for you guysAnd I want a proper alien answer also.America is a very ill societty uk  not far behindincredible. fuck me, what a speaker. i pray in aussie for americaHe’s way more well spoken in this setting not screaming or having some bogus reporter ask him question!Friendly reminder that after Bernie was cheated, he sold out to Clinton.What a booking, man...This guy is such a crazy old man and I cannot believe that anyone would EVEN consider him for office. Such a liar and self motivated elitist and concerned out his own wealth. Bet he loves that new beach house that he got after bailing out in the previous election from the murderous Clintons.Bernie looks to European countries as examples of good democratically socialist countries while claiming he&#39;s not a capitalist. If you&#39;ve done your research, you&#39;ll realize that those european countries are more capitalist than the USA! Low corporate tax rate and the most economically free countries in the world. Bernie, you have to be more capitalist, if you want to like those european countries and less regulation on business! You have to be more capitalist!The reason why most of what Bernie says here should ring hollow to listeners is the crucial fact that Bernie has been a senator for decades and has done literally nothing the entire time other than live off the tax payer&#39;s money. He says he&#39;s for strong borders then votes against securing the border while calling efforts to secure the border &quot;racist&quot;. He says he wants the &quot;Green New Deal&quot; then votes against it while never creating his own legislation for climate change. Just another crony politician putting on a mask to secure donations.<br /><br />All this discussion proves to me is that Bernie is getting desperate. He sees his base moving over to &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and is trying to reclaim lost ground.Andrew Yang seems to be wildly more knowledgable than Bernie Sanders.  Even if you dont agree with their stances, being intellectually honest Yang is a far better candidate.That&#39;s not correct on the stock trading point. Every state takes a percentage and so does the Fed gov. It can be more than 15 percentThis is one of my favorite podcasts of all timeI wish they talked about growing up , protesting in the civil rights movement, and his consistent fight for the people. Maybe making it more personable as well as the journalistic questions. Otherwise 10/10 glad he went on.Last comment, you proved your point(s).  Brilliant!  Thanks for everything you do Mr. Rogan.Even though I&#39;m a Canadian, I&#39;ve followed US politics for as long as I could understand it. Bernie is slowly winning my support. I&#39;m guilty of believing what the media and non support groups have said about him. This podcast has opened my eyes. Great podcast and I learnt alot about this man.Did Bernie comb his hair with a spoonGarbageTo those who disliked the video, we honor your opinion, what about the interview did you not like?Oui voi I do love my sOcIaLiSmThis was such a good episode. Bernie seemed to open up better towards the end. You really understand someone’s perspective when they come one the jreWhy didn&#39;t he mention that he wants to tax every American by up to 80%? He even mentioned it during the debate with Cruz. I like some of what he&#39;s saying but he has a manipulative mind.Joe, criminals illegally sell weed in states where weed is legal,  if you legalize all drugs it wont stop the illegal sale of them , that&#39;s just a poor excuse to legalize all drugs. Which is a dumb fucking idea!who cares if hes a nice guy, look at his fucking politics people. He&#39;s a self identifying SOCIALIST. Why do you think all the Venezuelans and Cubans who fled to America are overwhelmingly conservative? Because they&#39;ve experienced the disaster of socialism.LOOKING AT THE COMMENTS, I&#39;M AMAZED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA THAT THIS MAN IS THE REAL DEAL. Bernie Sanders had a wave of young progressive supporters 3 years ago, till the DNC screwed him over for Hilary. This man marched with MLK and was arrested for tying himself to young black girls in the 60&#39;s over racial housing discrimination. Check his track record, he has been consistent all his life. He has always been on the right side of History, whether it was Racial inequality, anti- war, or standing for the average poor American. At his age, do you really think he&#39;s in it for the power and money??? The only reason he is doing it is because he truly cares about all of you! Wake up!!! He is the President we should have. Bernie 2020!a Presidential Candidate who has common sense and speaks the truth without the fear of loosing funding from the corrupt corporate corruping the system? oh my god what a socialist hitler. i would ride the reality show star train instead <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cleancoal">#cleancoal</a>Only thing i say is the NCAA should help cut college tuition down vs tax payer money they make more money than the NFL and they dont pay their players a cent when in reality they could nearly fund free tuition even cutting it in half would be fine pay players minimum wage and still make millions in profit a year its crazy no one ever talks about it its always the Gov has to pay for itIm so glad we don&quot;t have guns in the ukI think Bernie makes a lot of presumptions about trying to root the issues out. For example, when he refers to President Johnson instituting Medicare, he dismisses the fact that starting with a blank slate may have been what made that easier to do at that time. We have more tools and technologies, but there is a lot of infrastructure that requires addressing.<br /><br />I appreciate what he wants to do and why, but I don&#39;t think <i>he</i> appreciates the difficulty in accomplishing those gargantuan tasks. That said, perhaps his attitude is what&#39;s required to do such. Regardless, enjoying listening to him.The other.5 is for my self10k dislikes and not a negative comment to be found. Comments are clearly being deleted. What I’d expect on a socialist interview.This man has no chance to winThere are hundreds of millions of guns in our country, Millions of Assault weapons, and less than 1% of those guns will ever be used to kill a human.. but you want to take them away because some mental nutjob decided to abuse themSee where years of spinning dark webs of stupidity? Bad questions before a great man.Amazing interview Joe. You did what major networks don&#39;t.wish bernie coulda challenged joe on some of his more outdated ideas...Joe aint as woke as he likes to thinkI came here for the comments. I really enjoy most of the JRE podcasts, but this is one I won’t waste part of my brain watching or listening to. Socialists suck.lmfbo this motherfucker really does not like the math that happens with economicsI&#39;m looking forward to giving Bernie my vote: Sanders 2020!YoBernie had a good heart and talking points, but he is too of a dinosaur to lead the country at this time. We need younger candidates that are more up to date.... hint hint... Yang 2020Only reason there are 2 million candidates on stage is so Democrats can get to the second ballot at the convention and use super delegates to pick Biden/HarrisBernie expressed his concern for rural white Americans at the same level as blacks and Latinos. SJWs are gonna maul himArtic ice has been melting for years and years...its happening rather we speed it up or ni otThat moment when Bernie Sanders sits on the Joe Rogan podcast for 67 minutes and praises European political candidates getting 30 minutes to get their message out. 🤣😂😅There is no such thing as an &quot;entry level job&quot;. There are no entry level bills. Its a made-up term to justify low payI like Bernie. But probably still voting for trump. The DNC will never nominate Bernie. They want a deep state globalist to sell-out America to the UN.Right now if Bernie ran as an independent he has a better shot than any Democrat running. That party screwed him once, why does he think they will give him a fair shake th is time.bernie the goat frAmazingly good show Joe, Respect to Bernie for all the work he is doing to get america a better country.<i>&quot;Is the idea that healthcare is a human right, not a privilege, a radical idea?&quot;</i><br /><b>Yes, and I will explain why.</b>  A right is something you have independent of other people.  It is a natural right that you have by the very fact that you exist.  A right to liberty, so long as you do not use your liberty to infringe on others&#39; rights to liberty.  It is not something bestowed upon you by others, it is something you are entitled to simply by existing.<br /><br />Healthcare cannot be a right, because healthcare <b>necessarily</b> is something that must be provided to you by another human being.  It is not something you have independent of others, it is a service that another human, with equal rights to your own, must perform for you.  Therefore, if healthcare is a <b>right,</b> what you are explicitly saying is that you <b>have the inherent, natural right to force another human being to perform labor for you.</b>  Definitions matter.  The word &quot;right&quot; sounds nice, but it has a meaning, and diluting that meaning helps nobody.  If you have a right to healthcare, you have a right to force another human being to perform labor for your benefit.  If this is not what you mean when you say &quot;you have a right to healthcare,&quot; you are simply misusing a word you likely cannot properly define.<br /><br /><br /><i>edit: And just to preempt any non-arguments: I&#39;m fully in favor of a nationalized system of medicine for the US, and think it would do the most good for the most people.  I just believe this would be an amazing entitlement for citizens of this country, and not a right.  Because there is no way it can be reasonably considered a right.</i>As a leftist, I don&#39;t trust the democratic institutions in this country enough to give up my AR-15.&quot;The scientists are telling us we have fewer than 12 years to transform our system or there will be irreparable damage&quot;<br />There is not a single scientist anywhere who makes that claim you fucking liar. The UN is filled with politicians not scientists.It&#39;s so easy for politicians like Bernie to sound noble and get people to agree with them and spout leftist talking points when the audience has little to no knowledge of anything from  economics to organic chemistry. I love Joe but if your going to have a political candidate on, someone who seeks shape and enact public policy through holding office you really need to do your homework and ask the relevant questions. I&#39;m a libertarian but I&#39;m not against a social safety net and I&#39;m fairly populist/economic nationalist, I agree with Bernie on many issues but his ideas ARE out there, he knows it, he is deliberately dishonest  and they won&#39;t work and it&#39;s been proven. This interview dissapointed me. Joe should of consulated with anyone from Eric Weinstein to Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro to Michael Malice before doing this podcast, he fed Bernie softballs instead of challenging his policy proposals which he can never defend. Even Dennis Kucinich isn&#39;t as far left as Bernie idealogically.I love this man &lt;3 America&#39;s dadI agree he has identified certain problems that need to be dealt with, but his solutions will cripple small business, destroy Wall Street, bankrupt our country even more and create massive unemployment.  Sorry, not feeling the Bern. I think this is the absolute best way to hear from our candidates though, fascinating to hear him truly express himself regardless of my intense dislike of his policies.Bernie is great, sure. Are all of his ideas popular? No, they are not. Can he make a difference? Yes he can. None of this matters though if the corporate banker cunts at the top 1% are allowed to run rampant. Any president who comes along and shakes the ladder that these top 1% stand on, are on a fast lane to a limo ride in Dallas. We need a revolution.This was great.Needed 3 hours..Talk about a softball interview. It&#39;s cool when you have these people on but you never challenged him once when he dodged questions and gave VERY generalized answers. I&#39;ve heard you come down hard on people for doing the same shitThis a beautI wonder how Bernie would deal with military conflictsHave Donald Trump on Joe!Nice free advertising joe...have Trump on. Owen sure is rightJust dropping by to say fuck socialismWhoa!!!The sad thing is that the best answers are usually found in the middle, but neither side is willing to concede or compromise. Bernie lost me when he started off the podcast by stealing Andrew Yang&#39;s line that the debates are just reality tv.Bernie is a smart man coming on theJR podcast.Never talked about wars or any foreign policy, Bernie could’ve gained a lot of supporters if he did talk about it and could’ve exposed trumps lies about foreign policy.Joe,  do the debates pleaseWhere I struggle with Bernie is that Warren exists. She has taken a nearly identical platform and made it more pragmatic and attainable. She also has prioritized healthcare at the hot button issue instead of spreading herself super thin.Removing guns wont change anything. In other countries where guns are banned criminals use Knifes, Acid &amp; Explosives! The issue is not the trigger it&#39;s the finger. Find better punishment for these crimes.Great interview.So Bernie is against the debates because they only allow for sound bite answers......this whole interview was a montage of sound bites....a whole bunch of solutions with no prescriptions.“Military style assault weapons” that are available to the public such as an AR 15 use .556 caliber bullets and they are intentionally made to make less fatal wounds so we can question the enemies.Raise minimum wage on companies with 1 billion market cap or higher. Leave the small businesses aloneUnbelievable! Thank god for Joe Rogan and this platform.I try to go into it with an open mind and the first comment from Bernie out of the box is &quot;let&#39;s force private companies to give us airtime via legislation&quot;He&#39;s insane. Almost everything he&#39;s complaining about was either absolutely untrue or created by the big Gov&#39;t Democrat policies that he&#39;s touting.Bernie &quot;healthcare is a U-man right&quot; sandersI&#39;ll be back to watch it tomorrow but I already know Joe is a little bitch and didn&#39;t ask any good questions!Hate him or love him. <br /><br /><br />His spitting straight factsBernie just came for the free cocaineJoe is a tuna....... where is Redban...?     exactly....Great podcast! Joe interviews most people better than real journalists. A long format helps. Really get to know someone. Love or hate him, it was a still a good podcast.America makes the fking guns, we&#39;re the plug, the big dick bullies so of course it makes sense that the #&#39;s are that high here.2012 JRE: In basement getting high with Brian &amp; Ari <br />2019 JRE: <b>Multiple actual 2020 Presidential Candidates guests</b> <br /><br />I&#39;m just so proud of this podcast as a fan.Socialism is one of those things that falls under the category “looks good on paper”. Live in China , Russia,N. Korea or any other socialist nation and let me know how that works out. No billionaires in these places. A good economy has rich people, a bad one has lots of government control. Vote for Bernie and your children’s children will pay...literally. Thanks and loved the show.The ban on &quot;assault weapons&quot; was not repealed by anyone. It was a umbrella ban. And it was found to have 0 effect on gun crimes in America.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23LearnMMT">#LearnMMT</a>Great chat. Thanks for this Mr Rogan. 👍No guns, no problemsI hope more candidates come on the podcast. I&#39;d hate for the great JRE to become even more political, but this is by far the best source of policy discussion I&#39;ve seen.Imagine an Aussie Joe Bogan.Fuck this guy.Climate changes.Joe asked him a clear question about how companies are going to survive if you raise minimum wage to $15 per hour and Bernie literally had no economically feasible way to explain it.Bernie &quot;I only hated millionaires till I became one&quot; SandersJoe &quot;123, BOOM, and we&#39;re pre recorded&quot; RoganMore candidates please!If you have so many enemies threatening your life that you need an assault rifle and can NOT turn to the authorities...Then you are either into highly illegal activity or a complete A hole and deserve to be shot yourself.   I believe in the rite to own guns for hunting and self defense.  The Tony Montana scenario is NOT a viable excuse to own semi auto guns.   In TEXAS nobody has a conceal and carry to shoot back?He’s the only candidate I don’t feel is trying to sell me on himself.WOW!!! Thank you joe. And thank you Bernie. I agree with 98% of everything you said and to be able to be on a long platform like joe’s and plead your political position you have my vote.<br />.5 % of my problem is over and over Bernie says remember 50-60 years ago. It’s now not History. <br />Other .5% <br />Remember when the constitution was written? Remember when I signed that bill to raise minimum wage? And the employment rate went down because corporations said fuck it I’ll cut labor costs and fire the difference of employee’s.<br />The other .5% call them Brave? what you want????. I’m still wondering if he just had a lapse. <br />He represented properly though and he  did a excellent job. And because of your show JOE and giving him a platform. <br />I WOULD VOTE FOR BERNIE SANDERS. Unless you can get a better Candidate?Podcasts like this should replace the commercially televised debate format.How red did Bernie turn when quizzed on aliens?! He also just said he didn’t have access to the records, he never said whether he knows anything...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=32m45s">32:45</a> Nevader.Bernie!!!!!!Most student loans are government loans. You worry about making a decision to start a student loan at 18? How about joining the military that will cut your student loan debt drastically.I don&#39;t agree with the Bern but I agree with presenting both sides of an opinionWait don’t they just finesse tf out of Joe by putting these whole podcasts out on YouTube 🤣🤣My disagreements with Bernie aren&#39;t about the problems.  My disagreements are with his solutions which would fail and or create much worse problems imo.  You can&#39;t help the people by giving their power up to the government.  Even if you get a good guy in government.  I prefer solutions that truly give power back to the people.  Government shouldn&#39;t be negotiating medical costs.  People should be negotiating medical costs just like everything else.  Get the government out, and make medical costs and options visible to consumers.  Give people the ability to customize their coverage instead of letting the government decide what&#39;s best.  Minimum wage should NOT be a living wage.  It&#39;s for 16 year olds for the first 6 months of their working life.  Is the problem with lower class that they have too little money relative to their contributions or is it that our culture tells them the newest iphone (or other unnecessary goods) is more important than 3 months of emergency savings?  Which would also help move wealth from the rich to the poor without giving up our power to the government.You know the burn hits the joint 🤦🏿‍♂️SHARE THIS LIKE CRAZY !!<br />Such a great interview and amazing information.I like Bernie Sanders , but around 15 minutes In joe asked him to further elaborate on how he would accomplish the things that he wants to accomplish, and all he did was re state his agenda with more detail. I think we all can agree that the we would all want to pay less for college, not have to worry about healthcare and so Fourth, But I would just like to hear not what should be accomplished, but how these things would be accomplished.Make certain guns illegal so ONLY criminals will have them and raise the minimum wage so that most small businesses have to shut down or fire employees. He has really good ideas! Bernie 2020 fo sho!I’m a major conservative but what Joe is doing is fair to all viewers of his channel. Why only have one pov like the MSM when you can interview people from all areas of the spectrum. Not a Bernie fan but this is a respectable move.Cancel student debt, lmao. How does one &#39;cancel&#39; debt?&quot;Billionaires who are greedy type people&quot;<br />People who earned their worth by providing goods worth more than the money charged are greedy? I say the asshole, Bernie, who never earned an honest dollar in his life that depends on violent extortion for a living is the one who is greedy.Healthcare is a service.  How does somebody have a right to a service?The problem is the doctor to patient ratio. As an HVAC technician after about 10 hrs in the heat and anxiety your mind is not in the place to appropriately help people. We need more doctors and nurses to help with the load.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=01h06m00s">01:06:00</a> Fossil fuel industry isn&#39;t lying. Your constituents who drive gasoline cars are lying to themselves. Don&#39;t blame the messenger.Loved the podcast, bernin&#39; down tha house boiiiii; but ultimately it&#39;s still a joe rogan podcast when, mr. rogan asked mr. sanders if he were to take office, and finds evidence of aliens, it&#39;ll be announced on their next jre podcast together.<br /><br /><br />until they meet again!bernie 2020Joe is a liberal bastard. Shameful. Get TRUMP on you Liberal Soy boyThis is really the way forward. I sincerely hope enough of America is ready to walk away from this dark, dark situation we are in.Wonder how much pudding Bernie would eat if Joe let him smoke some Mike Tyson weedGet this: NOW that Tulsi Gabbard has emerged as a viable candidate because of her debate performance, and because she&#39;s already brought a lawsuit against Google for election interference; now SHE is being branded as Putin&#39;s newest puppet. LOL! The demoKKKrats and their lame stream legacy media propaganda arm are so pathetically vapid. It&#39;s sad. They somehow manage to be corrupt, pro-war, disrespectful of veterans, slanderous, misogynistic and xenophobic in one fell swoop. But you won&#39;t hear Bernie the socialist sellout wind up doll say it. Won&#39;t hear it from the 1/1024 native american nor the 1/1024 African american leading the pack of hyenas either. Too busy going after Obama and his allegedly racist VPpls dont bring AOC next lolGood move by Bernie to go on JRE...but if he gets elected our economy is going down the toilet. Don’t let the shows appeal and the down to earth act trick you.Bernie “everything free” Sanders...Bernie “I’ll tax the rich” Sanders...Bernie “we live in the richest country in the world (but we’re in 22 trillion in debt)” Sanderssocialism sucks.  joe rogan sucks.  this is sickening.He dodged the implementation question completely. I don&#39;t think that the FBI is going to be knocking on people&#39;s doors. Hmmm...seems like another dodge. Soft selling a communist  future to joe. Joe &quot; feel the bern&quot; rogan.Great. Now do Bill Burr&#39;s MMPodcast to talk about all the crazy broads ova there.Joe doesn&#39;t question anything he says. Joe, we&#39;ve seen you make a great argument against the &quot;illegalize the sell of &#39;assault weapons&#39;&quot;, why aren&#39;t you making that argument here? QUESTION HIM!Fuck you Bernie Sanders and fuck socialismmarijuana <br />aint<br />heroinAin&#39;t nobody with atleast 2 brain cells are gonna vote for this old ass man that&#39;s never had a real job and has 4 big ass houses and supercars that says we have to tax the uber rich 🙄🙄🙄🙄Bro those 10k dislikes are supporters of that orange guyPharmaceutical companies and insurance companies are ripping us off blind and cost of healthcare is a joke too except that the joke is on all of uslmao what the hell is an assault weapon??  bernie is a jokeBernie/Yang, or Yang/Bernie either way, that the only thing I can see to save this country.Wonderful interview so far. I’m a Trump supporter but this was such a breath of fresh air compared to all the echo chambers we’ve been dealing with lately.A politician who has never had a real job is interesting and for the working man.  Give me a fucking break.you can kill people much more rapidly with a bomb than you ever will with a handful of guns. Timothy Mcveigh proved that man, and he almost didn&#39;t get caught because he was able to walk away before the truck blew at the oklahoma city building that was bombed. Hundreds died, and not a single shot was fired. If people have evil in their hearts and the will to kill indiscriminately, then bans and laws will not stop them. The only thing that stops people from continuing to shoot others is people who are also armed. When you take away peoples ability to defend themselves, you will only create more victims and not solve a damn thing.I cherished every second of this podcast, TBH it felt like 10 minutes.<br />$1,000,000,000,000 QUESTION......ALIENS / UFOS &gt;.&lt; YES, YES YES<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h06m55s">1:06:55</a>Great to see a podcast where a man who became a multimillionaire by literally accomplishing nothing rails against rich people for an hour straight. Excellent softball questions, Joe - totally managed to not call Bernie out on not paying his campaign workers the wages he wants to force others to pay. Bernie is a totalitarian that still wants to put people in cages for drugs and wants to force medical workers to be slaves.To the states that have closed primaries please register as a democrat so that if you want to vote for bernie in the primary you are able toeat a dick Bernie you socialist bitchBernie has fought for rights since he was young. Not like other politicians.Ugly God made a song about this guy 😂😂😂😂I&#39;m leaning right on many issues but i must say this guy makes a lot of sense on plenty of subjects. I totally changed my mind about him. The media lies to us they fabricate stories.Bernie or I’ll just leave the country.<b>casually look at thumbnail thinking its some random old man scientist or some shit</b> WHAT! ITS BERNIE SANDERS!!! clicked that mother fucker so quick!Been watching the JRE since it was just him, his shitty camera, and guests that no one knew. Now he’s had multiple presidential candidates, among other huge names, and is broadcasting to over 5.9million.&quot;Joe Rogan Experience #1330 - Bernie Sanders&quot;<br />&quot;Right, uh huh&quot;<br /><i>Clicks</i><br />&quot;Holy shit&quot;these fucking commies always fail to mention how long the waiting list is for any sort of treatment in Canada. If something is free how long do you think the line is?!?!?! Of course a man like bernie gets pushed ahead, HES MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU, YOU FILTHY PEASANT!  There&#39;s people with cancer that have to wait an entire year for treatment! &quot;boy, I sure hope I don&#39;t die waiting for my free healthcare&quot; WHICH ISN&#39;T FREE BY THE WAY, NOTHING IS! if you&#39;d like for your taxes to go up, and wait even longer for treatment than go right ahead and for for comrade Bernie sanders, who went to the soviet union on his honey moon and cant even pay his staff $15/hr while driving a sports car that costs over $200,000. The mans a fraud, and his fans have the intellect of a house flyI like Bernie but he kinda just has his few talking points and doesn&#39;t stray far from them. Like suggesting the solution to the opioid crisis is to increase economic prosperity. That may help some, but it ignores other factors like doctors over-prescribing opioids for pain management and causing patients to get addicted.Let the dems debate in the octagon with joe as the moderatorI hope Putin is watching this video and he is inspired, not scared.All I got to say is look at the Bernie Presidential Platform and compare them to Hugo Chavez or even Fidel Castro, they are very identical.  From free schooling, healthcare, big gov&#39;t, and eventual  ect.  And Bernie is a HUGE race baiter.  Always trashing Trump claiming the crap to divide the races.  Just look at the DNC debates.  That man was 3X the same questions because the first 2X he claimed Trump is a racist.Im libertarian, some of Bernies views are too far left for me, but he was the only politician in 2016 talking about getting money out of politics. If you don&#39;t want money out of poletics, you are either very rich or very stupid. BERNIE 2020Right, the manufacturing jobs were sent overseas. That is one of the major reasons we elected Trump. And Trump is delivering. Have you actually listened, I mean actually listened to Steve Bannon speak? The democrats never had a problem going along with Rhinos on this insane policy of &quot;free trade&quot; just like they do when it comes to the endless wars and military occupations. The only anti-war political commentator is on Fox News and his name is Tucker Carlson. The only anti-war non interventionist candidate (besides Trump) is Tulsi Gabbard. You&#39;d think her service in the armed forces would really seal the deal and democrats would be clamoring for her. But no, after the 1st debate Google allegedly (and I do believe they are valid, especially given the recent whistleblowers documented by Project Veritas)) interfered in our election (this time) by handicapping her algorithmic-ly and prohibiting her ability to purchase advertising during a crucial time just following the 1st debate when she was the most searched candidate. Following her even better 2nd debate performance where she tore Kamala Harris to shreds and exposed her record as a criminal prosecutor, the lame stream DNC/multinational corporatist legacy news media is claiming that Tulsi is a Russian asset, Putin&#39;s pick, the Kremlin candidate lololol. How dare she give Kamala a taste of her own medicine, well not really cause her offensive was grounded in reality and Kamala totally is a phony opportunistic hypocrite with a terrible record. And not the Snoop Dogg record she claimed to have gotten high to a decade before it was released. But I digress. <br />Going backl to my actual point Trump is following through by doing everything he can to ACTUALLY fix the border for good. Which is a first. Believe it or not, I can show you footage of Bernie one decade earlier testifying in front of Obama, calling on both illegal AND legal immigration to be restricted because American workers were having to compete for jobs and their wages stagnant because of this fact. In fact, he remarked, immigrants were just a tool for the 1% and corporations (he mentioned Wal-Mart by name) to keep labor costs as low as possible. He also briefly alluded to offshoring of jobs providing that function as well. On that front, that is what the tariff&#39;s and &quot;Trumps&quot; trade war with China is all about. I can&#39;t understand why people who love taxes so much hate tariffs so much. They falsely call it a tax on consumers. Shows you the paradigm most of democrats including progressives are in. Suddenly the &quot;woke&quot; crowd are awful concerned with consumerism (and the rights of BIG tech conglomerate corporations.And we know that cheap labor, power and geopolitics is of more interest to them than the immigrants ILLEGALLY crossing the border, more than half of whom are raped on their journey, most often facilitated by the cartels which now profit more from human trafficking than drug trafficking.) China is one of the worlds top polluters and it is increasing year by year. The paris accord required NOTHING, NADA, ZILCH from China for a whole decade, as we get gutted. Just in time for UN AGENDA 2020! Surprise!<br />We know that socialism and communism are an economic fail (unless you&#39;re China and manipulate currency; exploit workers; pollute the environment; are a technocrat communist authoritarian dictatorship surveillance state; with questionable accounting which is not made public; which engages in intellectual theft and steals the technology of some stupid ass political and corporate elite class that build your country into prosperity and power.) But while the right sits around for decades twittling their dick, the demoKKKrats take hold of every institution, so much so that culturally, the Marxists dominate. So much so that Nike can get away with making an anti-american 2nd string communist that played for San Francisco their CEO, practically speaking. G-d only knows how much consumers would pay for a pair of sneakers if the billion dollar athletic giant didn&#39;t have Chinese kids working for nothing manufacturing their overpriced low quality footwear. Trump, being a populist that was ingrained in the culture and used social media won.He made being a republican, a conservative, a patriot cool again, and a little naughty. No better time for online censorship and attacking the 1st amendment, right?! Along with the 2nd. Columbine and 9/11 happened somewhere between 8th grade and sophomore year for me. Marilyn Manson and Eminem were taboo. They wanted to ban GTA. I was all about the counterculture and what they now, almost 2 years later call &quot;progressive.&quot; I also was a teenager who didn&#39;t really know shit but thought I did. I thought Trump was a total joke until that first primary debate where he wiped the floor with a candidate pool only democrats could outnumber (after fixing the election for hillary, and proceeding to cover their tracks by creating the biggest hoax in American politics, possibly ever. When Trump savagely destroyed Jeb Bush and the war in Iraq, in front of a room full of GOP neocon rhinos, I knew Trump was the truth and became a deplorable, even though I didn&#39;t know it yet Hillary hadn&#39;t insulted half the country yet referring to us as &quot;a basket of deplorable&quot; and &quot;irredeemable&quot; and even though I had slowly trended away from &quot;progressive woke sjw politics around the time I voted for Jill Stein, got dreadlocks, decided to major in sociology, transferred to the university, and spent a few weeks occupying wall street (well, the Bucky Dome on campus, and the the interfaith community across the street after the campus police finally &quot;forced&quot; us to leave school property (it was brutal, trust me. They yanked on one person&#39;s arm who was playing &quot;this land is your land&quot; utop the bucky dome) I remember looking up from my &quot;Racism without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States, by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, why I was sleeping on the grass when I had a nice apartment of my own of my own, albeit with roomates including an R.A., a block away. Not long after Obama bailed out Wallstreet, wall street was no longer occupied, warren was dolling out the money, the tea party started (i think i wrote about them in my &quot;Culture of Fear&quot; class and considered them some sort of racist fear mongering group trying to connect it to right wing radical groups we were learning about like WACO-lol) but I joined the Sierra Club sponsored student group &quot;Beyond Coal&quot; our goal was to shut down the coal plant on campus and retrofit all our electricity to solar, in CARBONdale) that met at the interfaith center So by the time 2015 came around I&#39;d heard it all and was pretty burned out by the whole radical leftist schtik. Still, as a registered democrat I voted for Bernie in the primaries. Ever since Bernie lost (we dodged a bullet, but the left insists on committing political suicide) I&#39;ve been pushed away, called names, mocked, and deliberately misunderstood by my fellow comrades and the democrat party. In case 3 years majoring in sociology wasn&#39;t enough, these past 3 years have been the icing on the gay cake and a daily remi9nder of how insufferable the left truly is. It&#39;s been pretty eye opening. I&#39;m still woke. I&#39;m still an sjw. I&#39;m still punk, and i&#39;m still a wook. I&#39;m just a deplorable now. But feel free to call me a Russian troll and a white supremacist. An uneducated Trump supporter. I know how much pleasure it brings ya&#39;ll and I enjoy spreading joy. peace out, bitches!It&#39;s the MINIMUM wage, man. Do you fight over two pennies on a bill?This year for Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast has been amazing man.

If you can cost-compare treatments -- like you do with every other purchase in your life -- in a 3 second internet search, market efficiencies will equilibrate costs. The current (health insurer-administered, black-box, &quot;oh, that&#39;s how much that costs?&quot; three months later) system distorts all concept of cost and fails to optimize the service provided to the patient.

The assault rifle is just as dangerous any other rifle. If your gonna take one gun your gonna take them all. I actually agree no one needs a assault rifle. Problem is that’s a slippery road to go down. A person with 6 hand guns can do equal damage as a person with a assault rifleOn the Democratic platform, Bernie for Prez and Tulsi as Vice? I will continue my research, but that thought just gave me a Keanu Reeves &quot;WOAH&quot; moment.Bernie wants to take your money for his own mansions and jets just watch Animal FarmDiiirtty fucking sodomites1.) No one is &quot;taking away&quot; your snap benefits. It actually says more about you, like: 1a.) You are come from a mindset of scarcity, 1b.) even though you yourself receive benefits and you 1c.) assume everybody else in this group is enrolled in this &quot;resist&quot; group is also dependent on government assistance.) despite this you still automatically assume the government is trying to take away something. Which is technically correct. The democrats, particularly those who refer to themselves as &quot;progressives,&quot; ARE trying to take away 150 some odd million Americans health insurance. You can&#39;t &quot;keep your plan,&quot; because private health insurance will be illegal. Basically Obamacare was a failure because, despite a legal mandate, it gave free citizens too much power and control over their own healthcare decisions. So big brother is going to give you the convenience of doing away with employer based healthcare. There will be no expectation of private employer based healthcare because it will be public, and there is no option. It&#39;s because mom said so. The overbearing mother personified. So why work? Well because then you can give the money you would have paid for healthcare to the government to pay for healthcare. Except now you&#39;re going to have it automatically deducted from your income, assuming you have any. And you will likely be paying more. And have less to no choice. And you&#39;re giving your labor out to ppl who didn&#39;t pay, don&#39;t work. Every check. And immigrants who crossed the border illegally too because democrats advertise free healthcare for everyone in the world if they can step foot on our soil. And your doctor, probably not gonna be able to keep them. Or your specialist. And if you&#39;re in a rural area i home you like receiving healthcare via skype. And in the city, well, you&#39;re used to paying high taxes to build dysfunctional transportation systems you still have to pay for that are often dirty, unsafe, late, extremely crowded; and you&#39;re used to waiting for public housing, really waiting for the democrats you swear by to do anything but keep you trapped, but I digress. Democrats like the idea of &quot;take away.&quot; They want to take your job and send them to China, or import competition that disproportionately effects socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and the most vulnerable working populations. They want to send your kid to war(no draft for now), but they also want to take failing schools and increase class sizes, and take away school choice while they&#39;re at it. Ones like AOC who went to PRIVATE universities. They want to take away your 2nd amendment rights, even while they encourage lawlessness while some, like mayor lightfoot here in Chicago, hire PRIVATE security and refuse police escort. They want to take your 1st amendment rights, and will back the most powerful profitable corporations to do it. They want to take away private property; private business, or at least create a roadmap to make it virtually impossible for anyone but the elite to have an ability to acquire those things or even the hope to one day. They want to completely remove all your privacy at all times. They want to take away G-D; they want to take away forgiveness and redemption; the family; the individual with the collective; community; solutions to any of lifes problems or mysteries with THEM and a single objective totalitarian truth, which Alexa will tell you while keeping tabs on your every moment. It seems as though they are on a mission to take away MY ability to think for myself.<br /><br />Anyway, i g2g but the original point I was trying to make was that 2.) Raising the minimum wage makes it more likely they replace you with a illegal immigrant, a robot or keep you fire someone else and pay you 15 dollars an hour to do twice the work. Which is EXACTLY what it was recently discovered Bernie has been doing to his campaign staff! And since you make more, everybody will make more, and everybody will pay more but unlike the Chinese tariffs it will be more likely they replace you by outsourcing your job to China, or another foreign country. Also the tariffs bring in billions of dollars from China. Because this president has balls and a brain and is loyal to America. Democrats want 2 things: regulations and taxes. Who does this hurt? The American working class and small business. Not a big problem for Google or Amazon. Since your income will be in a higher tax bracket, you will pay a higher rate of income tax. Since less Americans will be working, those who do will be covering for leftist failed policy that creates the largest income inequality rate, the largest homelessness rate, despite beuing the 5th largest economy in the world and also the most &quot;progressive.&quot; Also the most people fleeing to other states, where they will vote in the same shitty policy which infested the place they came from. They export bad policy, it&#39;s true.<br /><br />and finally 3.) We have the lowest unemployment rate since a long fucking time ago. Coincidentally, less people are enrolled in SNAP because they no longer need government assistance. They&#39;re making they&#39;re own way. That&#39;s a GOOD thing, for everybody. Black unemployment is at a record low! Hispanic unemployment! Women; everybody! Wages are starting to creep up. Those minimum wage laws take years to get to $15 an hour too, so don&#39;t even try to use that as your explanation. <br />This is all GOOD, these are signs of a HEALTHY economy. Always worried about the ones you&#39;re forfeiting your power away to taking advantage. I wonder why?<br /><br />Lastly, Personally I qualify. But I go to my community foodbank. Local grocery stores donate funds donated by customers. More important they donate stock they need to clear for whatever reason, including perishables that would likely not be sold and thrown out. This is an efficient system and a generous system, Maybe a system that is better than letting everyone steal up to a 1000 dollars of merchandise without fear of prosecution. Or one that enjoys biting the hand that feeds them while handing everything they have and demanding they take from others they covet, all the vanity to think of themselves as morally superior victim of systemic circumstance. Without unnecessary waste to blame on a capatalist system. They also get fresh produce from a community garden that people are given a small plot and choice of seeds for if they want to put in the effort. The information is made available at the foodbank. most of the volunteers are church affiliated, churches also donate. There is no political ideology mixed in or pictures of Jesse Jackson on the wall. Luckily I have transportation\. My problem is I don&#39;t have a kitchen and the power often goes out if i run my microwave without unplugging everything. But I don&#39;t starve. And I get a good selection of stuff that I wouldn&#39;t otherwise buy because I can&#39;t afford it. Furthermore I&#39;m not demanding somebody else&#39;s wages be forcefully taken from anyone who to support me. I use the foodbank, I&#39;m grateful my town has such a service to CHOOSE rather than food stamps, though without fail, as if required by law, they still ask me if I&#39;m interested in information about receiving foodstamps in addition to the two full carts full of food (not including the food I pass up on because of my living situation) i get every month. So be creative and you might discover that you&#39;re simply just a total fucking buzzkill.Did he take that &quot;reality TV&quot; line from Yang?Joe Rogan is a saint. He should bring on every candidate, and U.S. citizens would be better offJoe rogan be preparing for the fight he wants to really be in 🤣 he training his mind to be president lmaoWhere are the liberals like thisBernie being labeled as an “angry old man who shouts all the time” has the perfect voice for an ASMR videoI have a lot more respect for Bernie Sanders after watching this interview with him.Podcast length, one hour..<br />Amount of time Bernie looked at Joe... one minuteThe United States aren&#39;t even leaders of climate damage. All I heard was if we don&#39;t get our way, we will go to your state and riot. Let&#39;s tax everyone til their tits fall off but hey the government will take care of you. This dude is full of shit. Get Donald on.Bernie/Tulsi 2020Normally I would have wished that Joe would have pressed Bernie more on some of his policies, but hearing Bernie speak in long format wasn&#39;t bad. I don&#39;t agree with a majority of his platform at all but his was enlightening to hear him on this platform.Any candidate running for president that wants a shot at my vote better get on JRE!Talking about dispair, what about the family courts not given fathers equal time with there children.I dont buy global warming....I&#39;d like to see how he is gonna stop prices rising when min wage rises..and a few other questions joe didnt ask..but he seems like his heart is in the right place..Hey Joe, thanks man. This one, Mr Watts and brother West are just wonderful.Nazi or commie, I think we can all agree that money needs to leave politics.I&#39;m confused as to why people thought this was a good interview. Bernie repeated his same talking points without providing how it gets paid for. When Joe asked him about the speculation on Wall Street, he didn&#39;t even have the details to back up his position. The few times Joe pushed on other topics he goes in circles and keeps saying &quot;that&#39;s a complex issue.&quot; Could be the 1 hour time constraint, but I wasn&#39;t impressed and didn&#39;t receive anything eye opening or revealing from Sanders.Joe, thank you! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ournextpresident">#ournextpresident</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23legalizeit">#legalizeit</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23blazeit420">#blazeit420</a>Bernie&#39;s so real.

Can&#39;t think of the right word rn.Bernies idea to stop drugs is flawed,   less despair?   So then why do rich people consume drugs Already?I admit I am a conservative wh voted for Trump. I wanted him to focus on building America&#39;s business by building trade deal overseas which I felt both Bush and Obama largely ignored. 3 years later Trump shat the bed so many times it has devastated my business. Trump has done nothing to help small businesses. NOTHING!  He will never get my vote again!<br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve never listened to Bernie Sanders, less than 10 mins in I&#39;m ready to vote him in as my President. Damn, I wish I had known about him sooner. Practical, calm, knowledgeable, full of courage and smarts. Most of all I like that he is humble. I still don&#39;t think some of his ideas are achievable -- it&#39;s too difficult to change health are or get tuition free. Nevertheless Bernie&#39;s got my vote. Just as long as he doesn&#39;t pick that loon AOC as a VP he&#39;s got my vote.Big day, huh Joe Rogan.Ashame Joe for letting Sanders for lying and asking soft questions and not asking tough questionsIt&#39;s too bad he&#39;s turned in to a normal socialist instead of who he seemed to be in 2016.Joe doesn&#39;t believe that healthcare is a human right? Joe is racistHe is very misinformed about gun laws and guns !!! Does J.R.E. (a gun owner) press him on the issue hard.... nope .... Lame!!!! more feel good talkThe “gun show” loophole has been closed for a looooong time Bernie.Its almost like they dont want to raise the minimum wage to meet the cost of living so that the american people spend their lives struggling to just survive. Then the doctors tell the people they are just depressed and sell them pills for it. Which the insurance companies we are forced to pay for buy the pills.It all sounds good when he pitches it but everything he proposes and wants to do is not possible.How come you didnt ask him why he bent the knee and endorsed Hillary after she robbed the election with all of her corporate money from big pharma, military, oil etc...Joe &quot;I swear I&#39;m not reading a  script&quot; RoganBernie goes on about how he&#39;s rushed during debates (correctly), then leaves the Joe Rogan Experience after an hour when Joe would have obviously given him 3.  Missed opportunity to state his case better.  Just posted and already half a million views. What a moron.<b>TRUMP 2020</b>His hearts in the right place. The one issue I dont  agree with him on immigration. You cant have an open border and free health care for everyone. Also you can forget wiping out student loan debt. Get a job a pay your way or pay you bills. too many of these career collage student out there getting useless degrees.Joe good job having this hack on here, there u go people big government in the chair right across from joe. Everything that comes out of his mouth is a pure waist of oxygen. Sign up for u to have all your money taken from taxes to pay for illegal aliens and abortions and to help the weak generation that is today to not work for there results in life  yyaaaaaaahhh sounds like a winner.Health care is not a natural right. It&#39;s a commodity. You can&#39;t force people to work for you; that&#39;s called slavery.Everyone gets free stuff, then we all go back to my place and eat soup.  -Bernie 2020&quot;To me there are two results. One I will go all the way to be the president of the United states of America. Or two, whomever wins will sound exactly like me&quot; -- Andrew YangYang Gang 2020 Secure that FUCKING BAG!!! Sorry Bernie.LOVE THAT JOE ASKED HIM ABOUT ALIENSWhy are you giving this nutjob welfare whore time...and platforms?Glad to see he was on, but only an hour? I really didn&#39;t hear anything new or different from him, nor did I feel like I got to know the guy any better. I feel like he somewhat blew this opportunity to relate to your audience. The Tusli/Yang episodes were so much better.Joe Rogan should host the next political debate. No media, no biased audience that applauds every punchline. Just intelligent, long form, political debateHahah I love how all the republicans are quiet AS FUUUUCKAmazon doesn&#39;t use secret legal loopholes that only they and similar corps get. They use regular deductions, Amazon has made very little profit and over the last few years relative to the huge losses they made prior to making their first profit, losses are deductible from taxable profit, and so is r&amp;d and so is developing real estate to make plants etc.GUIDE FOR JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE #1330 - BERNIE SANDERS<br /><br />Debate time constraints -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m16s">0:16</a><br /><br />Misconceptions of Bernie regarding healthcare -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m22s">4:22</a><br /><br />Lobbyists and Pharmaceutical companies -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=10m41s">10:41</a><br /><br />Minimum wage -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=18m57s">18:57</a><br /><br />Corporation tax loopholes -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=21m19s">21:19</a><br /><br />(“Joe, it’s legal because they make the laws!!” God damn it! -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m17s">23:17</a>)<br /><br />Education -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=25m02s">25:02</a><br /><br />Mass shooting violence -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=31m56s">31:56</a><br /><br />Mental health -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=42m24s">42:24</a><br /><br />Marijuana -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=45m26s">45:26</a><br />(...*cough cough*  -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=48m08s">48:08</a>)<br /><br />Other drugs and opioid epidemic -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=48m30s">48:30</a><br /><br />Poverty -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=54m33s">54:33</a><br /><br />The President’s job -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=57m58s">57:58</a><br /><br />Climate change -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h00m04s">1:00:04</a><br /><br />Aliens -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h06m58s">1:06:58</a><br /><br /><br />[ end ]The problem with &quot;entry level jobs&quot; is that yes they&#39;re assumed to be employee&#39;s that do low level tasks, but it is exploited by employers and these employee&#39;s are doing much more than stigma says.. and have you looked at job descriptions for current $15 an hour, they&#39;re manager positions.. which should be no less than 50k a year, at $10 an hour I shouldn&#39;t be running two departments worth $200,000 to the company or corporationWhen is Trump coming on2nd amendment rights. Deblowsio can afford private security, in addition to personal police escort. Not sure if everyone has that option. So it&#39;s nice to be able to defend youself. And give a little deteremnce to assholes that want to take guns away, take everything else away to. Like your healthcare plan, doctors, car, private property, labor, money, 1st amendment right to free speech, any expectation of privacy, due process, right to choose your kids school, right to HIPPA dr/patient confidentiality; community based services; the family; culture; G-D; redemption that isn&#39;t state sanctioned; ability to start a business; ; freedom to think for yourself; freedom to question them; do any of this in the public forum; freedom to nopt get vaccinated; freedom to not have health insurance; freedom of choice; freedom in general. the democrats want to take away your freedom and liberty and independence and hope. It&#39;s almost as if they&#39;re racing to do so. They call it &quot;progressive.&quot; They don&#39;t know much about history. I forgot, they want to take away statues. It&#39;s symbols. They want take away the nations sovereignty. They want to take away everything that makes this country great because in their mind, in that small pea brain they have to force us all to repent of our collective sin and be more like some other miserable shithole people are moving trying to escape from. Take all the people moving to places like Texas from California, for example. Or the ones from here in Illinois moving to Colorado, or wherever. So long as there is some sort of inequity, they want everyone equally miserable. When they aren&#39;t defacing synogogues or beating up people with Trump hats; the stupid ass hoodlums in NYC are dousing police officers with water (for now) and pelting them with buckets. In Chicago here we have the strictest gun control in the nation and also a killer homicide rate (all from the shitty ass part of town my cannabis tax dollars will be going to because somehow they are never responsible for their own behavior or situation, because they&#39;re black obviously, and if you say otherwise you&#39;re racist and most likely mentally unfit. So obviously we need the entire country to be as prohibitive, and by extension I can only assume that extends to the entire globe. Apparently their war on drugs logic does not extend to equivalent issues like guns. Pick n&#39; choose.<br />Sounds pretty mental to me. <br />OH YEAH, SINGLE PAYER UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. What could go wrong?In Canada they kick you out of the hospital within 3 day after heart surgery there is no 1 month in the hospitalHealthcare cannot be a human right because healthcare is a service that needs to be provided to you by someone else. You can&#39;t claim someone else&#39;s service as your &quot;right&quot;.As a conservative in the great state of Wyoming. I agree with several points Bernie has. For instance  healthcare, weed etc.  however  his gun control ideas are a bit extreme. I can tell you that every other person in my home town has atleast 1 ar15/ar10 (meaning armalite not assault riffle) and we have never had any issues with mass shootings of any sort. We had a threat in our neighboring state South Dakota at the bike rally in sturgis.  Everyone started caring and bringing there guns to protect one another. The rally is still going on however there is no fear of a mass shooting and no gun violence has occured.    We use our guns here for sport and to protect one another And ourselves.My thing with increasing minimum wage, it&#39;ll possibly inflate prices. People that make more than minimum wage will be paying more for products while not getting a pay raise. Back when I worked EMS, I didn&#39;t even make $15/hr. Why would I deal with people dying and losing grasp of life, getting PTSD from the shit I&#39;ve seen, and possibly ruining my home life when I can make the same flipping burgers at McDonald&#39;s? There are a lot of health care workers, public safety, ect. that don&#39;t make $15/hr, why would they do that deal with their stressful job when they can get an easier one making the same. Increasing minimum wage will decrease incentive and motivation, while increasing inflation.Why joe why???BERNIE &lt;3A &quot;philosopher king&quot; politician. H2es got my vote.All I want is for Bernie to stop coming for our guns and our 2nd amendment. Idc about anything else at all. I&#39;m all for the &quot;free&quot; healthcare.Bernie doesn&#39;t stress that we need to start not spending money on these foreign wars.  That&#39;s what Tulsi Gabbard is saying and it is more important to do that then tax the rich even more.  Both are important but the cost of these wars is the bigger issue.We need to hit rock bottom in America before we can change all of this.I loved this!! Joe is the new modern day Johnny Carson. The world is changing and now Mr Rogan holds a very influential stick in this media world. He&#39;s more level headed than 100 percent of ppl on tv. Joe Biden on next??? Please lolHow can any American not vote for this guy .<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>I wonder what Alex thinks about Joe having not only a globalist, but an open globalist that wants us to move into a triumvirate with Russia and China... I wonder 🧐Nice not having to listen to him yell about our &quot;yuman&quot; rightsWe need Bernie 2020 (or Warren) but for the love of Osiris, no Biden.As i start, I see 52k likes to 10k dislikes. I’m willing to bet the 10k dislikes are just knee jerk reactions because it’s B. Sanders and not because of the conversation.Do American a favor and get a professional debate on hereI finally got to hear Sanders. I like what I heard. But. What I didn’t hear was anything about the villains on this planet, N. Korea, Iran, Russia, Cuba, and all their allies! That’s where all these ideals he spoke of fall short. Nothing about military support!Whether you like him or not, Bernie is first and foremost a genuine, empathetic human being, and then secondly a politician, at a time when a lot of the other candidates are the opposite of that.Bring some heat BernieWhoever see this , I don’t care what side of the political spectrum you’re on. I wish you happiness and love ☮️Did Joe ask him about pretending to be on the phone?In Canada, you don’t get any doctor you want at the hospital. You get the doctor that is available. And the bill is not always $0. Not everything is covered and the best treatments are only available to those who pay.Next guest: TrumpDemocratic socialism is what happens when two wolves and a sheep decides what&#39;s for dinner.Bernie: im not an extremist. <br /><br />Also Bernie: Tax everything. Ya welcome. Problem solved.&quot;my ideas aren&#39;t that radical&quot; everyone gets free shitDislikes are not coming from republicans. Dislikes coming from centrist Democrats. The party of the billionairesSo should smart people not be rewarded for their talents??????????Awesome&quot;Hey Jamie... Pull up who&#39;s gonna pay for this real quick.&quot;I wish he would’ve gotten into why he got kicked out of a commune for being too lazy and his lack of policies passed since he’s been in government 😆I heard that there are only 2 countries in the world advertising medicine directly to the public.....The US and the other was bulgaria or someplace small.  It is sicking and the side effects and small print are enough to discourage me.Imagine Joe Rogan gets Trump on the Podcast hahaha<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=38m17s">38:17</a> ya bernie get that booger. ill still vote for ya...maybe :)&quot;White people dont know what its like to be poor.&quot;<br />-Millionaire, Bernie SandersJust one hour :/ I understand this is a campaign focus interview but bernie seems an overall interesting guy to have a board conversation with. I hope he comes back.<br /><br />Joe is really good at cross-questioning btw kudos to him.In the rest of the developed world, Bernie would be considered a centrist.Lost me at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m55s">4:55</a> “Health Care” is not a right. You have no right to the labor, services and products other people create. That is known as slavery.Yang gangWAIT WHATI first would like to welcome our new Ant overlords and would ask that everyone respect an Ants authority over humans. Thank you.fucking joe got Bernie on haha 👌Wow even JRE is pandering now. SmhIS BERNIE ever gonna stop hating on Trump and call out the democrats, deep state and corporate media that manufactured the longest running, most expensive, most corrupt presidential investigation&gt;unfair presidential primary&gt;RussiaGate???Sometimes when he has his finger waving in the air his back is so hunched back i get worried he may have had his spine removed.<br />Not Me...US? Well, some of us who supported him on that side of the aisles presidential primaries last time around also supported Trump. <br />So there&#39;s that. And the fact that he&#39;s a wind up doll disguised as an old man.What about healthcare for non US citizens and decriminalizing crossing the border or staying on an expired visa?  This was cleverly not mentioned.Going on Rogan should be a requirement for running for president. How else are we supposed to know a person well enough to vote them in without listening to them speak genuinely for 2-3 hours.i really respect bernie for doing this interviewExcellent podcast and great to let Bernie speak uninterrupted and not have the footage edited.  I&#39;d still never support him nor buy his solutions but like his hope and motives.oh bs he&#39;s just like every other politician.  lies lies and more lies. tell the morons what they want to hear and never do a damn thing. sure i&#39;ll vote for ya.... hahahahahaha!!!!  i&#39;d vote for joe before i vote for anyone in any office in this country.If you raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour you better put a cap on what companies can charge for goods otherwise overnight gas will be $8 a gallon and we will be right back where we started.I left college where I was having the best time of my life but had to join the military to escape the looming debt. So what happens to people who served and payed off their past debt with the majority of the money we make in the service?Bernie &quot;Here&#39;s the thing&quot; SandersMAGA!!Vote for Bernie!I have mixed feelings about Bernie. I liked him best in, back to the Future.Bernie “Holodomor” Sanders&quot;Assault&quot; weapons...sigh. You cant stop mass shootings but you can increase your odds, learn how to shoot.Great interview.<br /><br />The US healthcare system is inefficient and corrupt, and maybe a single-payer system would work better, but that’s a<br />bit like exchanging cancer for aids and calling it a success. Healthcare systems tend to be inefficient and corrupt, because people want unlimited access to the best services and want someone else to pay. This is not possible, and declaring healthcare a right won’t make it possible. Healthcare will be rationed, and people will either pay in dollars or pay in waiting times. So long as politicians keep promising the impossible, they will keep corrupting the system again. Bernie will do the same.<br /><br />Comparing US healthcare prices to foreign nations is misleading, since if the US went single-payer, none of these other countries will be able to continue as they are, because they currently benefit from the US’s high prices. They will need to start paying higher prices, fund their own R&amp;D, or slow the rate of R&amp;D altogether. One way or another, people will pay, because shit doesn’t happen by magic.<br /><br />$15 minimum wage is insane. If you want poor workers to have more, much better to just hand them a check. If a worker does not produce more than $15 (+ other costs of employment) of worth for his employee, then he will be let go, because his continued employment would be a net loss. It’s that simple. Perhaps, alternately, the employer could drive the employee harder, give him fewer breaks, or take away costly amenities that the employee enjoys. In this case, the employee may actually prefer lower pay for more pleasant working conditions, but a minimum wage can remove that possibility.<br /><br />Just give poor workers more money directly. Price controls (of which the minimum wage is a kind) are an extremely crude and inefficient means to achieve the same end.We&#39;ll &quot;get together&quot; as you wish, Bernie,  but without you and your fellow democratic socialists...One Word: EPICcan we get Bernie some water plz? seriouslyI’m a Canadian living in the US.  There is no way the healthcare system is better in Canada.  In fact it’s quite worse.  Stop telling fake stories.  It’s equal to the service you get through medicaid.  I have insurance way better than medicaid.  In fact, in 2018 my daughter was visiting my mother in Canada and broke her arm.  They waited 5 hours and they put her arm in a plaster cast.  When she came back home, our doctor had to reset her arm and placed a imaged cast on.  He said he hasn’t seen a plaster cast in years.bernie has been a hack politician for the large art of his adult life during which time he renamed a couple of post offices. Im not a fan of Bernie so I&#39;m biased but the DNC and HRC very obviously executed some shady tactics against his campaign in 2016. He has never called them on it. In fact he publicly praised and continues to praise HRC after the fact.  If he can&#39;t defend himself on such blatant and flagrant corruption what does that say about the probability of him having backbone on issues that concern the everyday person.Close your eyes &amp; you get Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New YorkAll I heard was, &quot;TAKE POWER FROM PEOPLE, GIVE POWER TO GOVERNMENT&quot;YES YES YES, I LOVE JOE ROGAN AND I LOVE BERNIE SANDERS!!!Bernie &quot;for a variety of political reasons&quot; Sanders everybody.Bernie sounds completely insane. Remember his wife bankrupted a college with those same kind of radical spending ideas as well. Not a good look. He’s literally purposing a civil war with those gun policies. This is extremely scary. Also, don’t forget that he has a second citizenship in ISREAL. I don’t even think Trump goes that far up Israel’s ass lmao <br />Is it okay to have a President with a second citizenship from ISREAL?????? Is it? Would people feel different if the second citizenship was in IRAN OR CHINA???! This sounds extremely radical to me :)Why only one hour?Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s make very expensive, very tasty ice cream. It was my favorite for a while. Even though i&#39;m not the biggest fan of chocolate ice cream and marshmallows, i&#39;d always get Phishfood cause Phish is my favorite band. This was back when I lived with my parents and my parents would always give me a hard time purchasing a pint of ice cream that cost over five dollars. I&#39;d proceed to call her cheap for getting the vastly inferior Aldi gallon tub of ice cream. It was bot only inferior in taste, but also ethically. I felt a sort of smug sense of moral authority of the uncultured parents of mine. I was virtue signaling in a way, if not only to myself and the casheir who rang it up. And to my parents. Ben and Jerry&#39;s was a sustainable model for ethical business practices. Or something like that. They weren&#39;t one of those evil corporations. They understood the culture maaaannn, they understood ME. <br />Well Steven Colbert has a flavor. I know there was a &quot;Resist&quot; flavorafter Trump was elected. Not sure if they are still making it, I don&#39;t bother looking at that section of the freezer these days. I was made aware on facebook of a brand new Ben &amp; Jerry flavor: [drum roll please] A BERNIE SANDERS 2020 ICE CREAM FLAVOR!!! Which isn&#39;t surprising being that I went to the Bernie rally at Navy Pier not long ago and he mentioned Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s by name. Now, by that point I&#39;d done my own research. Didn&#39;t take long. Now, I have a number of gripes with the company but I don&#39;t want to be here all day. So I guess I&#39;ll just start with the obvious and ask you a question as it relates to your statement.<br />YOU SAY &quot;We should ALL be against CORPORATE food production.&quot; That, in my opinion, what in leftist speak would be referred to as &quot;inclusive.&quot; Nevertheless...<br />BJ&#39;s has nationwide distribution. You will find it pretty much everywhere. So, if Bernie wanted to use a commodity found in the frozen food section as a marketing gimmick, sort of like subliminal advertising, what would be the most obvious choice and effective way of doing that, for some woke warrior boujee progressive who didn&#39;t know any better and was so charmed they wouldn&#39;t do their own research and hold true to their own standards. The kind of socialist who supports Bernie&#39;s radical plan but will settle for Liz Warren. They kind of person who loaths the wealthy and is totally for the small guy fucked by the system, the evil capitalist system, charges and arm and a leg for the yoga class they teach, tarrot reading extra, but shops at whole foods(or did, maybe being bought by amazon or whatever was the final straw? They think we should completely eliminate all fossil fuels by yesterday or we&#39;re all gonna die, of course there is no special interests in &quot;sustainable development.&quot; UN AGENDA 2030? What&#39;s that, something you heard from Alex Jones, as they mock you our president our country from an Iphone, or wuiway or however the fuck you spell that Chinese trash, the one who argues on behalf of Big tech&#39;s &quot;rights&quot; to censor &quot;online hate speech and right wing extremism&quot; online. The kind that accuse Tulsi Gabbard of being Putin&#39;s puppet after they rejoice in Julian Assange and the thought of chopping off his head as they defend Comey and Clapper and call you a Russian troll and a racist homophobic xenophobic white male bigot. Faux News yada yada MSNBC and Vox told be so youtube bad yada yada google good (google own youtube. google has been exposes, look up Project Veritas. Not on Google or Youtube dum,my.) yada yada orange man bad yada The kind of people who drive a Tesla but wouldn&#39;t dare let you eat in it! no, no. The kind of people who &quot;feel uncomfortable&quot; when you challenge their propoghanda, block you from social media: but go on and on about &quot;this is what democracy looks like&quot; and &quot;power to the people&quot; and diversity, equity, inslusivity, ...you know the type. Ok. And they say we should not buy food, or anything, that comes for an evil corporation that we should be a socialist country, full on, well with maybe SOME exceptions. The kind that vote for Bernie and buy into Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s ice cream and I would know, totally guilty of BOTH. Feq questions IF you have made it this far. If so I commend you but this is where it gets harder. Strap in. <br />1.) How much money did Ben and Jerry originally invest to start the company and what year. <br />2.) Does Ben and Jerry still own the company? Do they manage it in any way? <br />3.) What year did they sell, whatever economic lingo you want to use, when did Ben and Jerry&#39;s stop managing and running their own company? <br />4.) How much money did they sell the company for? <br />5.) What economic system did they start their business and in what country? What state? <br />6.) Who was Ben and Jerry&#39;s sold to?<br />7.) Who currently owns Ben and Jerry&#39;s? <br />8.) Who currently runs Ben and Jerry&#39;s. <br />9.) Is Ben and Jerry&#39;s 100 organic made from free range grass fed cows? What farm produces it?<br />10.) The workers who produce this dairy, the ones working the farms...who are they? Where do they come from? How are the working conditions? How much are they paid? <br />11.) Are you gonna vote democrat? Who are you leaning towards?<br />12.) What&#39;s your favorite Ben and Jerry&#39;s flavor? Are you gonna buy the new Bernie flavor?<br />13.) Still think we should all take a stand against corporate food products?<br />I hope half of it is the best flavor and the best tasting ice cream in the entire fuckinng world. And the other half is red velvet, with vodka, cut up pieces of human flesh, the butt up a smoked cigar, ghost peppers, Canadian pharmaceuticals, lemonheads, and SAND. Lot&#39;s and lot&#39;s of sand. Mostly sand actually, Now the delicious half will be missing. Leaving just enough room to bury your head. I kid i kid. I expect questions one through thirteen answered by nightfall. Hasta la vista, baby! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MAGA2020">#MAGA2020</a> &lt;3Very first question about the debate and he steals Yang&#39;s response about the debates being reality TV.<br />And now he&#39;s following Yang and going on Rogan. 🧐🤔I&#39;m really not a fan of Bernie at all. Couldn&#39;t be further from his political views. But aside from his politics he seems very genuine and concerned about these complex issues and I can respect him for that. Great interview.Two things shouldn&#39;t rely on the free market. 1. Food. Leads to GMOs and overabundance of fast foods and bad ingredients. 2. Prescription medications. Nobody should be able to make money off of medicines. All research should be government funded.His economic ideas are wrong. Housing, food, gas, overall cost of living is NOT going up, it&#39;s the strength of the dollar which has diminished. The dollar was at it&#39;s strongest in the 1800s when it was backed by gold and silver. Then, Nixon took us off the gold standard in the 70s. Personal debt,  student loans, quantitative easing, government  bailouts, etc., anytime the Fed prints money it debases our currency more and more. More currency in circulation = weaker dollar = higher prices.I’m neither a Democrat or Republican but who the fuck would argue against free health care for American citizens? I under a lot of the left are just nuts with the racism this, racism that. Family separation bullshit and not wanting to build the wall. Which I think is ridiculous. You’ll put up a fence around your house but think a wall around your country is unethical? Beyond dumb but I’m all for free health care.Softball interview, just like the MSM no getting below surface level on Bernie’s answers.YeumenBernie 2020Steven crowder has lived in Canada, watch his videos on getting medical care, including his parents needing surgery,  and how that goes. And why a private medical care still exists their and people with money still have to pay for surgeries or care if they don&#39;t want to wait months.Couldnt take listening to his BS. After 10 mins I lost count of the flat out lies or withheld info to benefit his talking points. To hell with him.News Flash, USA is the best country on earth.. but Bernie wants us to be like all the others and buy all our products from other countries, costing more jobs... and the typical democrat that wants to take from the successful rich and give to the worthless poor(mostly liberals).. Oh and  lets make everything about queers n race, also wants to raise minimum wage so it causes inflation on the price of everything else making it fckn pointless other than running small business out....&quot;Climate Change is uncontrollable Bernie..you cannot control the earth.... Fck this guy.. typical dictator... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>Not one person will mention this, This talk of health care is such joke, when we all should be talking about what the fuck is causing people to get sick in the first place. Doctors or politicians never discuss prevention only treat symptoms, its pretty laughable.Assault weapons are weapons of mass destruction lol Geez60% of these views are going to go to the federal government 😂I put this on to fall asleep toStrongly disagree with Bernie but glad you got him on. Should be a good interview<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m41s">34:41</a> Beatboxing Bernie :Deveryone screams about bernie being a SOCALIST, COMMUNIST, RADICAL leftist then you listen to him talk and it&#39;s like oh... he just wants to give people better healthcare and take away power from corporation-paid politics... what a crime that would beFunny how there are no contradicting comments. Either  every single listener of JRE loves Bernie, or the comment section is being curated once again.I can&#39;t stand Bernie Sanders.This nigga voice irritating as fukkkSocialism promises. Capitalism delivers.  Bernie is a true believer  in the socialist utopia. That&#39;s why appears so genuine, because he believesAnd the damn debates are always on cable and since I don&#39;t have cable, I  have to wait a couple of days until they post it on Youtube. 😠Bernie is up there talking smart man talk.  God bless him.  He has carried the torch  for all the progressives for DECADES.👑Ima get with Bernie on the side work selln firearms 😂I will watch every presidential candidate who comes on Rogan&#39;s podcastFDR is a communist. Social security is nothing but a pyramid scheme. Why should I have to give the government my money, why can&#39;t I invest it on my own accord?Another person so dumb when it comes to guns and gun laws. but yet is senator of vt which has the losest gun deaths in the country.We know the “complexity of healthcare care in America Bern” as we live it and work in it every day!!!Something that bernie is really good at is bringing everyone together regardless of background. Hes pretty popular when it comes to poor whites as seen in the 2016 democratic primaries when he beat out hillary in rust belt states that she eventually lost to trump.Everyone in the USA needs to listen to thisThis is wonderful Joe, you might be the   media that makes a difference in the elections. Please keep bring candidates, from the left and right. What a superb interview! 👏poor people are the 1&#39;s with the most drug/alcohol problems right?  so we need to give them money to help them out.  well drugs/alcohol cost a lot of more to do regularly.  so those people had all the money to buy the drugs/alcohol, but they make poor choices with money.  so why would tax payers give more money to people that make poor decisions with how they spend their money?Bernie just said he&#39;ll make pot legal lets goEducation is detrimental to our country especially college.. I’m perfect example I can’t do the whole book and studying thing... when kids graduate what ever career they choose, that profession should be provided threw them and in return pay a certain percent.. if they change their minds they won’t be in debt thousand.. it’s even proven most people don’t follow the career they paid.. etc etcBernie has been in politics for a quarter century and still hasn&#39;t figured out how to not be completely full of shit.   Not to mention he combs his hair with a balloon.Over the next ten to twenty years, which do you think is a bigger threat to America and humanity at large, AI with all the trimmings or climate change?Mental ILLNESS MY ASS! These mass shooters are RACIST TERRORISTS ON A SUICIDE MISSION! THE FACTS ARE THE MENTALLY ILL POPULATION IE: DEPRESSION, BIPOLAR DISORDER, Schizophrenia, Schizo Affective Disorder etc is far less Violent then the General Population. Homicidal Sociopath is not a Mental Disorder! IN Order for Psychiatrists Doctors etc to receive &quot;Mental Health funding&quot; they Re-classify Homicidal Sociopaths as having a Anti Social Disorder in &quot;DSM manual&quot; in order to obtain funding for these SICK FUCKS. WHICH IS MISLEADING &amp; A DISSERVICE BY ENFORCING OLD STEREOTYPES ABOUT REAL MENTAL ILLNESS. THE &quot;DSM Manual&quot; clearly states there is no known real treatment or cure for HOMICIDAL SOCIOPATHS!!!! Mental illness and hatred exist throughout the world, as do video games. Frequent mass shootings are unique to the United States. The reason is guns, and especially semi automatics. Unique to the United States is easy access to the means to commit mass murder.Stop reading what u say.CUNTSMaking America great again, thanks Bernie &amp; JoeIf you&#39;re working minimum wage at McDonald&#39;s and you&#39;re 30 you probably shouldn&#39;t have a kid.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m32s">47:32</a> 😂Two of my favorite people!Get Trump on!Can’t wait for JRE Toons 👴🏻This podcast was scheduled for 2 hours, Bernie took the other hour for himself.Shouldve asked him why he accepted bribery to let Hillary win the democratic primary. Why he bent the knee and praised Hillary. <br /><br />The guy is just like the rest,  lying and corrupt and a hypocrite, dont let the government take your money because they think they can spend it better. <br />Socialism is a cancer and needs to be eradicatedShould have been a longer interview joeWhy don&#39;t we stop letting Big corporations donate campaign money? It seems simple. The problem is these scumbags working for us on our dime in the government will never purposely not let themselves get that moneyLove his ideas or hate them, you have to admit that this man cares about America. I would love for this to be a trend, honest and passionate politicians who just want to work together to change the world for the better.You Americans need to elect this man.&quot;I am not here to give all the answers&quot;<br />Yet you are so self assured that you resort to violent extortion (the state) to enforce your admittedly shallow opinion. You may be wrong, at least you are violent and evil.One response to climate change activists who argue that because the fossil fuel industry is profitable, and they lobby government, that we need to eliminate fossil fuels. Don&#39;t be fooled. ** Post­2015 Interactive Dialogue on Financing for Development and the U.N.

Imagine 30 years from now this podcasts being shown at school as a historical moment. Not just this podcast, but also other ones. The Elon Musk one is already legendary.If America is so bad, why are millions of people trying to get there?I wonder how Burnie feels about dmt. Hope joe asks.What what whaaaaaaaaa? Jeeezz...Joe reaching for the stars.@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m43s">34:43</a> wtf 😂VOTE BERNIE!!!!!!!!!Even one hour felt short for the profundity the topics discussed.   Could otherwise have gone for 2 or even 3 hours, easy.Thank youTerrible.Bernie&#39;s policies would destroy the economy and alot a lots of freedoms. Here in California we have many self check outs at the major stores . This is due to the high minimum wage.Bernie ever worry about anyone in any side it’s not the gun owners on the right it’s the people who get triggered from gendered language, clapping and chatter I’m fucking worried about.Bernie Sanders doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about when it comes to guns. Or he is blatantly lying. The gun control loophole does not exist and you cannot buy a gun and walk out with it the same day. Its upsetting, because he is intelligently explaining the rest of his points.Joe just won Bernie the 2020 campaignI don&#39;t support Berine I&#39;m glad he has a platform to speak on but he lose me on his gun stance. He does have idea on what America problems are but he has to start thinking of different ways to solve those problems. In my opinionIt just kills me with all the talk about 1 percent... <br />When Bernie himself is a multi millionaireThis weirdo needs to crawl back into his hole and die.Id have liked to see Joe push back a bit more. I feel like I&#39;ve heard Joe express some pretty strong opposition to a few of Bernie&#39;s bigger ideas. So I feel a bit like he did this interview a bit of a disservice.BUT that&#39;s also what is great about the podcast. Joe can connect, legitimately, with any guest he has and can do so by a seemingly effortless ability to listen to his guests and let them talk.Bernie 2020Bernie has my vote and I plan on passing the word along to my neighbors!! F^^k trump!!I supported Bernie when he ran for president last time but the Dems went with Hilary so I didn&#39;t vote. I believe he would have won against Trump and I still believe he can. Bernie still has my support.One hour is too short... But still much better than the degenerate TV fomat. <br />I wish presidential debates have similar format as this podcast. Just let people talk to each other! Time is not important, only real dialogue between people is important!Most of the money that goes into the drug companies is for R&amp;D for new ways to save lives.  Why is he so against new ways to save lives.&quot;The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people&#39;s money.&quot; -Margaret ThatcherCapitalism drives innovation, it can&#39;t be denied.Not a huge Bernie fan, and this didn&#39;t change my views at all, but it is really nice to hear, long form, what he supports and plans to do. Instead of presidential debates they should all have one hour, and be interviewed by a person from the other party (so they have to awnser the tough questions), or someone like Joe who even if he agrees is great at playing devil&#39;s advocate. That way we really know what they plan to do! Great job Joe! And even though I&#39;m not a huge fan, mad respect for Bernie for doing this!So something that I notice watching this Bernie Sanders looks at the table a lot. Not sure if that’s a thing but that would bothers me. The issue with increasing the minimum wage is more about small businesses that couldn’t afford that. That was never mentioned by Joe or Bernie. The only companies that will be able to afford that is the “evil corporations”We’ve always had guns and mental illness. Combine that with social media/Internet/24 hour news cycle and helicopter parents That don’t teach/raise their kids to be adults and to be held accountable for what they do equals mass shooting, lunatic!Take money out of politics and put a 8yr term limit. Shouldn’t get rich in politicsMy two favorite ppl to listen too 🤗Yang &gt; BernieBring on MarianneOh &amp; let me add Bill Nye was talking to someone about this in an interview it was Tucker Carlson I think &amp; Tucker goes so what would the climate be if we weren&#39;t here to which he didn&#39;t reply so he said what would be good then what time period &amp; he goes mid 1700&#39;s.  Go ahead look up the climate-society around 1750 it was HORRIFIC as we were in the middle of a mini-ice age so stuff wouldn&#39;t grow, people were starving all over the place, disease was everywhere because when you don&#39;t have nutritious food you get sick &amp; aer susceptible to disease.  It was a nightmare for the general public this is what Nye thinks of as being optimal.  Maybe because he assumes people like him were fine they prospered because they shill for the psycho &amp; sociopaths who rule.  I hope I&#39;m wrong about most of what I think, please prove me wrong.I wish Canadian politicians would do similar interviews. These conversations go way further than sound bites or attack ads to understand policy positions and a candidates likablity.Noone has a right to another persons labor.Last chance to save your country Americans. And not many other candidates are going to kickstart the green energy revolutionBack ground checks already cover every single thing he said . has ge never seen one?His voice is so intimate when he&#39;s not yelling.❤❤President Bernie Sanders 2020!!❤❤Fuck Bernie 🖕Climate scientists are not in agreement. The large majority are undecided or have no opinion (see Cook et al). There is only consensus amongst the minority and, even then, it is highly nuanced. So it is reasonable to be sceptical. Climate cultists and climate deniers are two peas in the same pod. A sane, logical approach is needed...and without political and corporate interference.DUCK THIS DUDE!!Man we’re in for a wild ride once the socialists get in!Wait ...assault rifles are the same speed as a handgun? This guy is naive ...first rifles then guns. Climate change has been going on since the &#39;50s. They make millions of dollars off climate change. Seasons change ..the planet varies in temperature over time. See you in 13 yrs. This guy is a grifter ....he&#39;s done nothing while in government...he would accomplish nothing as president. Majority of the time he doesn&#39;t look Joe in the eye. He actually believes his do nothing BS.We all love Bernie but lets face it, he will never be president. He&#39;s just not hip enough. Sadly, thats part of what it takes. He knows whats up but doesnt have the charisma...You cant take tax breaks small buisness use them to pay the IRS for every employee on staff. It cost money to keep someone employed. Employers of businesses are not evil. People are just programmed to remain as employees because a buisness take decades buildBernie is an interesting guy and pretty is quite articulate / influential on topics he speaks about.<br /><br /><br />The big difference between him and Trump is Trump actually worked / ran a business for his whole life.<br /><br /><br />Bernie never held a job (other than some short-term &#39;gigs&#39;) until he was elected mayor at 45, and now want to redistribute money he thinks just grows on trees because he feels people like him are entitled toit.  Scary to think he might actually succeed in this.  Don&#39;t take my word for this, google for his resume.I&#39;m not American but i hope Americans vote for this guy so we can all learn from their mistakeI pretty much just play Graham Hancock/Randall Carlson episodes on repeat... but for you Bernie Bros out there could you tell if Bernie actually enjoyed this interview or not?I&#39;m at 49 minutes I can&#39;t listen anymore Bernie is so full of shitBernie &lt;3Bernie for prez Pete for vice prez. Bernie can retire after 4 after and let Pete take reignsBeautiful. He&#39;s always had my vote. I had to change my registration so I can vote in my state this time. I was turned away from voting last time. Indepedent voters are marginalized and Trump rallied some crazy outlier support. Bernie just knows what he&#39;s talking about, you can&#39;t really deny it. Joe was a good volly for the ideas but he&#39;s solid and it shows<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang2020">#yanggang2020</a> guy here, extending olive branch to bernie bros! I hope Yang gets the nomination, but if he doesn&#39;t Bernie is my guy. I think Bernie did great here, I really like his taxation policy on Wallstreet, especially. You guys should check out Joe&#39;s interview of Andrew Yang, you might like some of his ideas, too!I agreed with practically nothing of what he said, but if you dislike the video just because you didn&#39;t agree, you are shutting down speech. I think conservatives talk shit about the left shutting down speech all the time, but when Joe Rogan (a more conservative person) talks to bernie sanders, a lot of people on the right become hypocrites. If your not willing to challenge your own views, you can&#39;t assume they are truth.Health care is a service and commodity not a right. However you have the right to buy the healthcare you want without government hindrances.Joe subtly trying to get Bernie to smoke on his show lolHe doesn&#39;t even look at the man asking the questions when giving his answers. How much of what he says does he even believe?feelin&#39; the bernYh im the uk we have 2 channels with no adverts and the adverts can defo go on there but some go on itv and channel 4 between adverts aswell &quot;This is party political broadcast...&quot;Cant wait to see the face of the trumptards when he walks out the Whitehouse in a year and greets bernieYou really missed an opportunity here to have someone like Dan Crenshaw or a conservative to debate Bernie. You gave Bernie a rim job this entire podcast. Good job with the hard hitting questions,  Joe..I don&#39;t care if joe is being fair or not bernie sanders and his polosis will destroy america and leave millions in poverty do not be fooled by him or joe or ant on the shills in this comment section he is an enemy of the people.12 years to change our fossil fuel issue or our kids are fucked ............. I can&#39;t believe greed have made this a reality for my son and everyone&#39;s sons and daughters. <br /><br />I&#39;m supporting Bernie any way I can. <br />For our children.Bernie Sanders is a 2020 Presidential CandidateWhy are we still having discussions about the media? Stream the shit on YouTube or wherever. It’s Free! And you have unlimited time to speak about important topics. No one I know in my generation even has cable anymore. We all watch YouTube, twitch, and Netflix. I really fucking hate that our representatives are OLD AS FUCK and don’t get it. I haven’t watched tv in 6 years fucking fuck CBS, fuck Fox, make a Presidential Race YouTube channel and stream the shit. I am so sick and tired of repeated discussions of old problems. Fucking fix it and move on to THE ACTUAL IMPORTANT TOPICS! FUCK!Within 3 minutes he is talking about passing legislation to control private media companies...He aint telling us about Aliens... that sealed his loss.CLIMATE CHANGE. GIVE US MONEY. Yea bro the weather changes. No we will not take higher taxes.Luv this guy!I may disagree with Bernie, but this is a fantastic format. I sincerely hope Joe invites others like Gabbard and Delaney on to have the same exposure. This is how candidates ought to have exposure in the first place.Remember this guys and gals Sanders couldnt evrn pay his staff 15 an hour, if he cant do that what makes you think he will come through on anything?I don&#39;t know if he has my vote but he sure does know his shit and he taught me a few things. I love how he speaks for middle America and stopping this fucking greed that is infecting our politics in america. I also love his composure. 🤔🤔Bernie is not a man that should be running this country. Mark my words when I say he will make this country look exactly like Venezuela in under 2 years.Well, I gave it a shot, but you lost me at &quot;Union-run healthcare&quot;... Next!Bernie is a good person but...YANG GANG WE NEED TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THINGSBernie says &quot;1% its 3 people&quot; when in fact, 1% is 3.5 million PEOPLE. Bernie wants to redistribute the wealth of 3.5 million people. NOT 3 like he tried to just lie and tell JoeHe did great, very informative. My only thing is that he isn’t talking about younger adults. Everything he’s pushing is for older people 45+Yea let&#39;s give the government control over everything. Socialist. Communist idiots.😎😎come on Bernie nip it in the but this country needs a changeBernie triggering the party of terrorists lmaoJoe wanted to ask Bernie to smoke with him so badFuck no. Look what diversity has done to western europe. Bernie just wants free shitImagine LOGAN PAUL and MIKE with their immaturity levels peaking having a guest like Bernie Sanders on their podcast ....IMPULSIVE deserve star guest like Riley Reid giving their microphones a blowjob while DRUGGY MIKE keeps interrupting OR stuttering ahhh ahhh ahhhhWhaaat Bernie is on!!! This is gonna be great!oh great.I wonder if raising the minimum wage will end the tyranny of fast food corporations. High school kids are gonna be making a living wage in high school, interesting. If he wants to give me a Tesla, then that’s great, but there are other countries in the word (all) that will still be using fossil fuels. I haven’t finished watching yet..Burney ill tax wallstreet? ITS ALREADY TAXED!!!!!!  I have stocks I pay taxes on them!!!!!This peice of shit communists....never worked a day in his life . Can&#39;t tell a real American  nothing.PS, Bernie isn&#39;t even a registered democrat so he should feel lucky to get any time at all at a DEMOCRATIC debate. Fucking commie.This guy is a fgt rtdLoL - the Dollar is backed by petroleum. With out the western world using fossil fuels the Dollar would be worthless.Bernie doesn&#39;t sound healthy.woah!<br />I feel like this is a real game changer moment in American culture and internet culture. This is a good thing, thanks for this interview Joe, very happy you were able to get Bernie onWhy does he keep comparing the USA to other countries???? We are the most profitable and powerful.<br /><br />How long does somebody wait for healthcare in countries where it is &quot;free&quot;?That was awesome! Nice to listen to a  good lengthy discussion with a candidate. Great job!Fuck yeah Joe. Great interview man. I&#39;m glad and thankful to be able to listen to both of you speak openly about everything.I’m no political expert, but I can not help but find it a little demagogic and utopian how Bernie Sanders repeatedly says that rich people are THE problem and most problems would be solved by “dividing” their wealth among the population. That’s a very simplistic and reductionist way of seeing things.NO ONE NEEDS AN AR! Tell me one pragmatic purpose for an AR, besides killing humans!Still too extreme for this country. Him and the majority of the democratic party going off the rails.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=42m21s">42:21</a> kudos JoeI gasped so loud when I saw this title. Bernie Sanders Holy Shit?A government cannot give you a human rightA bunch of ideas that sound good on paper, but when taken to their logical ends are complete disasters.So healthcare for all...   my mother didn’t get her leg fixed after terrible car accident because gunshot victims kept coming in.  They had to schedule it weeks after since the Surgery rooms were always booked with gunshots and drunk drivers.  Sent home with a crushed leg that had to be fused later to wait to schedule an appointment.  Yet every gunshot victim was surgically fixed and not paid for.  Then they say “healthcare isn’t paid for people who don’t have money”?  Huh?  It’s free for them.  They just don’t pay it.  It’s illegal to not take care of people that come in to ER.  No one is turned away.  It’s illegal!!!  The whole healthcare talk is lunacy.  You.  Must.  Agree.  Or else...   The left will come for you.Bernie: &quot;In 1941, after Pearl Harbor, we were faced with war in the East with China and war in the West with Hitler&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m32s">1:04:32</a><br />&quot;Putin is a dictator, Xi in China very authoritarian&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m09s">1:04:09</a><br />That was Japan, not China. Bernie has hidden sinophobia or anti-China McCarthyism. No wonder Bernie was going all along with Hillary and Hillary&#39;s Democrats on Russiagate.<br /><br />Notice Bernie said the country name China, while didn&#39;t say the country name Germany. So the collective China is the enemy to Bernie, not an individual like white folks of Germany? To his mind, the collective China is a dictatorship and Russia too? I can see Bernie pulling the same BS Russiagate on China, blindly accusing and smearing China as hacking US or meddling in US or stealing or copying or currency manipulation, which are general smears and racist smears or stereotypes. (US copies and steals and hacks and meddles and manipulates US currency via petrodollar wars to artificially prop up US currency and forcing other countries to prop up US currency via US military invasion threats)<br /><br />Also, Putin is a dictator and Xi is authoritarian? Bringing millions of Chinese people out of poverty, making people&#39;s lives richer is authoritarian? Then US executive orders are authoritarian too. How about address how US doesn&#39;t actually have a real democracy? How about address US&#39; legalized corruption in money equals speech, while China actively cracks down on corruption and at the very least designates corruption and bribery as illegal, as against the law, unlike US. Putin is a dictator? Unlimited term limits doesn&#39;t make an elected leader a dictator. US legislators or politicians also don&#39;t have term limits. US presidency only recently set up term limits, so majority of US presidents were dictators then? Canada also doesn&#39;t have term limits. Term limits doesn&#39;t mean someone is guarantee elected or in power for life. How about US Supreme Court judges being in power for life? An argument for that can be made for China&#39;s president or Russia&#39;s president too. Bernie is just broadly smearing, which is disappointing, as I thought he was educated and knew better than to resort to or rely on general smears.<br /><br />Actual dictators are those US allies with in Middle East and Latin America and Africa.<br /><br />Bernie, surprisingly and ironically, has shown to be a classic Republican or conservative from McCarthy era. (That&#39;s how far right the country US has shifted to in this day and age, when Bernie, with conservative view points of working families and nationalism, is considered extreme left or liberal)<br /><br />Actually, China is ALREADY leading the world in green energy, solar energy, etc. Bernie&#39;s view of China (mistaking Japan gaffe aside) is very much archaic Republican McCarthy era.<br /><br />As for Bernie&#39;s plans as president, his solution is just to rally more protests and get the people to persuade their local representatives. Ummm people are already doing that by going to Bernie&#39;s rallies and in voting for Bernie. If his solution when elected into office is to push the responsibility or job onto us voters, then why even elect Bernie in the first place? Bernie has shown to be a failed leader, time and time again, like when he kowtowed for Hillary after being cheated. Bernie is a great protester, throughout his career, but a protester doesn&#39;t make them a leader or proficient. People want someone to get the job done, not more rallies (like Trump, but for different reasons; Trump&#39;s rallies are to boost his ego, while Bernie&#39;s future rallies are to ask the people to do the gov job, which the people don&#39;t have time for that, since they&#39;re working and trying to survive living paycheck to paycheck, hence electing someone to do the gov job for them).Great streams of thought out of Bernie. You could see his mind&#39;s eye picture what he was saying. He was running on all cylinders, and… where is the ‘how to’ in all of this? Where is the passion, that would mirror the visible passion he has for a change of course - a change of how we as individuals, and United States citizens, understand the real power in this wealth at the top of our tremendously impactful and important Nation?Has Bernie paid his staff 15 hr minimum wage??Bernie must never seen toe  show , toe Rogan roast Bernie all the time! LolA video on why not to vote for this muppet. Thanks Joe 👍Wtf is with the possibility positive comments is this joe rogan or what? Where r the hard questions I thought you tried to think bro?As a restaurant owner the 15 dollar min wage would shut me and thousands of restaurants down. While these idiots protest in front of McDonald’s about this, McDonald’s is laughing at them. They’re the ones who can afford to pay their staff that. This guy doesn’t know how to separate me from Amazon. You’re a business owner you’re rich and your helpers are poor. Never mind all the risks I’ve taken and years of not making money it took me to finally make some money.I started watching now but I assume he didn’t question him about his hypocrisy regarding the minimum wage and his campaign staff.Im not a fan of bernie. But i am glad everyone gets to listen to him and decide for themselvesAll I’m saying is if the government ran colleges like they ran public schools. I’m not looking forward to it at alllllllBernie “I just talked to a guy” SandersSanders for president, Rogan for Vice President!!!!I’m not surprised at all that a hack like you brought on this clown to your showWow.. seriously? You&#39;ve gotta be joking.Seems like Joe didn’t push back on any of the incorrect points that Bernie made. He allowed Bernie to make claims that he has literally refuted in the past month or so. Truly disappointing.yaaawwwwwnnnnnnnnn No wonder Joe was only able to talk to him for an hour lolWish Joe gave more push back.  He have follow up questions that Bernie gave no substantial answer to and just moved along.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m00s">1:07:00</a> My god that small glimpse into a potential (even if unlikely) event of Bernie announcing, as President, that UFO&#39;s/aliens are real on JRE...  lolol.  Please oh please.Whooa, Canadians get an incredibly hefty tax bill for said 0 dollar healthcare.Please let Trump beat this comrade back to Russia where this kind of thinking belongsClimate change waste of money not realI wouldn’t want a man you can’t make any eye contact at all to be my president no confidence at allMake America Venzuela Again!This is such a huge move! Thank you Bernie for having the balls to go uncut/unedited and try to answer these difficult questions on such a huge platform. I’d love to see Trump try and go for an hour and not sound like a complete moron. Even better, Bernie doesn’t act like a child and spend 90% of his airtime smearing the competition. He spent the time being PROFESSIONAL and answering RELEVANT questions 👏👏👏 Well done sir.Thank You Joe for Having Senator Sanders on the show. The debates are such a cluster, it&#39;s great to actually hear the candidate. I hope You offer the same to all of the Candidates.Never trust millionaire socialists.Yes!!! The man with a plan and a history to back up his words- not just placate us all. I am so happy to see this!! Thank you Bernie &amp; Rogan!!! ❤️🙌You most certainly won&#39;t convince anyone of the climate being warmer overall &amp; that it&#39;s going to keep going &amp; going because of US.  If you want to convince people let&#39;s see real debates on prime time with real people on both sides showing the literal data &amp; also the skewing of data which has happened as the temperature record has been &quot;adjusted&quot;.  People believe real data not frilly words or scary statements that is how you do it.  I haven&#39;t seen-hears of a single legitimate debate on the pollution/climate which included what I just said nor have they even broached the subject of the Sun, it&#39;s cycles &amp; the fact that we just left a mini ice age around 1860 the exact point in history all of the highly paid &quot;scientists&quot;  start their charts which isn&#39;t how you do science &amp; hurts your argument.  It should be getting warmer &amp; that should last for about 5-9 more degrees F before heading back down again which is what the Earth has been doing for hundreds of millions of years from our data most of those CO2 was exponentially higher BTW &amp; very likely the only reason humans are here as the last big CO2 push Earth had is how all of the rain forests etc. were formed as high CO2 makes plants grow much faster/stronger.    In my opinion pollution is the issue along with the pollution they are spraying in the skies constantly which is a crime upon humanity.  If &amp; this isn&#39;t true people are flying so much that at least 1/3 of days are just a haze then they have to cut that in 1/2 at least period but like I said it isn&#39;t that.  I&#39;ve lived all over the US from Mass. to Cali. this isn&#39;t isolated it&#39;s systematic &amp; as I said a crime that some day those responsible will pay the price for.I really think he&#39;s out of touchBro get Ron PaulFuck bernie.    He gonna die trying to be president.......trump 2020 and 2024How could you not ask Bernie about not paying his own campaign workers $15 per hourhe has no idea how economics works...Americans u better vote for Bernie.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=38m17s">38:17</a> pulls out bugger and wipes it on his pantsJoe &quot;getting feet wet“ RoganLol... Ya know joe this is amazing a woman came up to me the other day and asked me....(insert any political agenda) Politicians are so full of shit its so convenient that any question asked he was just explaining this to a random person.. Raise min wage? what about young kids that dont really need the money? &quot;Ya know joe the other day a young woman came up to me and explained how her family was on hard times and she is working for min wage trying to help her family and.....&quot; Stfu stop with the bullshit all of these people are just blowing smoke up our ass some more then others but they all are the whole system needs to be rebuiltHow can anyone dislike this? This man is an absolute gemThumbs up if you disliked 👍🏼Ooooooh shit.You think trump could hang on this show for 30 mins????Hell No. F This Guy!!Tyt are so mad right now! 🤣🤣🤣Just clicked long enough to make this comment. This JRE I won&#39;t be watching.12% of minimum wage workers are teenage.He said WWII was with China and Germany, shouldn&#39;t that be Japan?Holy shit didnt realize Joe had so many socialist fans, fuck Bernie, Democracy is majority rule and evil. Socialism is the government owning your labor and redistributing it at their liking, also very evil.Sanders/Gabbard 2020!<br />What a ticket that would be!It&#39;s very nice to hear bernie talk and explain things in more depth than the media allows.Holy moly smokes its freaking Bernie!!!Rogan is always blaming antidepressants on murders. I wonder if all the 18-28 year olds killing each other in Chicago and L.A. are on them. Fucking moron. You think something that boosts some serotonin levels is going to magically make someone want to kill hundreds of people. It’s way deeper than a medication Joey. Go take your onnit garbage and take two hits off your joint like a pussy.I would rather antitrust these super rich companies than implement a socialist government. That&#39;s what antitrust is for, don&#39;t force America to pay for the people that don&#39;t want to work.The dems screwed Bernie once and they&#39;re trying to do it again!a white supremacist libtard who worked for demoKKKrat governow wallace shot and killed MLK. these demoKKKrats will say and do anything for power. everyone gets free healthcare but you goto eat yur own pets or starve to death.Bernie had me till he started talking about banning &quot;assault weapons&quot; what do you not understand about &quot;shall not be infringed&quot; Bernie?Fuck you bernie Trump 2020I&#39;m sorry but I just can not fathom Bernie having a conversation with Putin. Hes way too nice.TFW a comedian on the internet performs a 1000x better job of delivering an objective and balanced political interview than any 2019 journalist.If trump was to loose to anyone it want it to be this guyI have never been more excited to see a new JRE upload. I voted for Bernie the last time around after seeing him front row at a rally. Even got to shake hands with his lovely wife (unfortunately he walked to the opposite side of the crowd so I missed him.) <br /><br />Bernie is the real deal. Everything he stands for is rooted in that special frequency of love and freedom. He&#39;s the hero we all so badly need but unfortunately may not deserve. Bernie is 25 years ahead of everyone when it comes to progressive thinking.<br /><br />And at the end of the day, red or blue, Bernie is just a great person. Even if he never got into politics, his actions speak so loudly. He literally came to my city just to be in a company protest for union rights. He lives nowhere near me and he just showed up one day. It was never on the mainstream news, it was something he did because he knew people needed a voice. He&#39;s not a politician, he&#39;s a volunteer, a soldier of light and forward thinking.<br /><br />BERNIE 2020!Millionaire socialisti&#39;m just waiting for joe to bring up the free marketAll Bernie has to do is say he smoked weed with MLK and he’d immediately win the electionSmells like communism to me. If the platform is open to everyone then do Trump next.Gotta respect a guy that can admit he doesn’t have all the answers!Bernie 2020-2028Haven’t finished listening yet but I hope he asks Bernie about why none of this countries with socialism are as big or successful as the United States. It’s because capitalism works. Stop selling utopia that’s not possible. Garbage man isn’t the same a doctorThe true front runner of the Democrats don’t let the media push Biden or Kamala (cop) on to youThank you gentlemen.  Isn&#39;t it nice to be able to sit and relax and talk?INFO WARS DOT COM SPREAD IT REAL NEWS!!!Employers of giant corporations can pay up yet small buisness cannot afford to pay the 15 dollar raise without increasing their rates. Especially intensive labor while millennials hide behind cash registers. These young men cant even use a shovel &amp; take jobs that are suitable for the elderlyRaising the minimum wage is more difficult now than ever before as we are fully entrenched in a global economy as well as being in an age of technology where human jobs are rapidly being replaced by computer algorithms and machines.Bernie is just too angry for me... unlikable hypocriteliterally got a pharmaceutical add after I watched this... damn google..Love this guy stay strong bernieI feel like Joe was begging for an understanding of the history of corporate personhood and how through various litigations corporations were given the rights of human beings.  Citizens United vs FEC and other cases turned corporations into human beings under the constitution.  One case equated money with free speech.  So since corporations are humans, and humans have the right to free speech, this makes it so that corporations have the right use their money(free speech) to buy politicians and therefore make the laws.  Its the basic mechanics of the corporatocracy.This was good to hear him speak uninterrupted. I would rather watch each candidate do this than those debates. Bernie seems to answer who? What? Where? Why? Reasonably well. The HOW seem to be the most difficult for him.Bernie is the best.My question on the $15hr minimum wage..what happens to the guys making $20-$25hr? .. cost of living WILL go up with $15hr mw. Therefore pushing the $15hr lowman right back into the same position, yet the guys getting by on the $20-$25 cannot afford things. Why is this not being addressed?This is really disappointing....where are the hard questions? It&#39;s great that he was given a venue to expound his virtues and get his ideas out, but Joe never asked him any of the legitimate questions he should have.  Explain the 3 mansions he owns for example, while demonizing the rich at the same time....just one of many questions that should have been asked and answered. Why is it okay to constantly call the POTUS a racist, yet in the same breathe blame Trump for the violence supposedly caused by his divisive rhetoric?  Why doesn&#39;t he recognize that as being nothing short of absolute hypocrisy?...Why does he perpetuate the claim from the left that Trump is a White Supremacist?I love how he using the mathNot a fan of bernie but great talk. And hearing him in a long form respectfull situation makes him seem less crazy amd more resonableLooks down very little eye contact. Talks about other countries doing better. Nothing very good about US. Government ran health care Im out. You think it&#39;s great go talk to a veterern. Just rang in the drug companies. The government cant even negotiate drug prices with Medicare. You think they can run anything but the mouth. They are all crooks out for themselves. He is a millionaire and a career politication. How did he get rich humm its called bribes.Weekend at Bernie’s nah how about <br /><br /><br /><br />WEEKEND AT ROGANS  and if Bernie gets high right now it could be weekend at ROGANS 2Good conversation, you were professional and calm.  Great questions half way through the podcast.  Obviously you made the point. Thank you Joe.I literally hate all of his ideas minus some of the healthcare stuff but he is more sane than I had thought....seems like a genuine dude&quot;I&#39;m Mr Maduro, I&#39;m a dictator, I love dictatorships&quot; - Bernie Sanders 2019I really tried hard to listen and give Bernie an honest chance...but he just isn’t cutting it. He gives vague answers on very specific issues, and appeals more to emotions that what is factual and practical. When he proposes solutions, it’s like his budget is bottomless! No one can argue the problems he highlighted and how bad it is for people, but his solutions...even a decent 20-something college graduate can come up with them with the assumption that government can pay for everything without any repercussions. His ideological agenda is really not rooted in reality, and he should know better. He was around when socialism vs. capitalism fought it out for decades and that which one was proven right. The West won, the Iron Curtain lost. It’s that simple.<br /><br />In any case, thank God for Joe Rogan. One podcast single-handedly is beating all TV and all other media for honest discussion and truth-seeking. Joe’s podcast is the lynchpin protecting truth from all corruption from those who wants to corrupt it.I have trouble listening to this delusional old bastard.He had no answer for gun control. 400 million guns that they know of.I’m disappointed, Joe. I watch your channel because we share an interest in the cosmos, we question reality, and you ask the hard questions to your guests. When you had Steven Crowder on, you asked him tough questions... But every question you asked Bernie Sanders had already been asked/answered.Yuck. Watching with the feeling of talking to a grandparent with dementia. Fuck commies also❤Bernie❤This guy has no chance agaist potusBernie is a fucking idiotReally wanted Ben Shapiro to be there with Joe Rogan and then impersonate Bernie :vGreat discussion but I disagree with the 15/hr minimum wage that’s just to much I’ve been working 4 years in construction and just started making 22 a hour and I would feel very un motivated if I knew I could go do a no thought requiring easy job like work at Taco Bell and make 15 id much rather do that then bust my ass everyday. I’d say 12 an hour is a reasonable minimum wage it leaves room for growth and it’s not as crazy of a leap from the current minimum wageShould&#39;ve smoked joint with him!Just cutting out the lobbying, corporate expense accounts, and executive pay packages would save billions in healthcare spending. No one discusses this.WE STAN THE BERNIE MAN.The problem isn&#39;t that college isn&#39;t free, it&#39;s that we&#39;ve allowed colleges to charge insane amounts for tuition. The solution Democratic socialists suggest isn&#39;t to limit tuition, it&#39;s to subsidize it though taxes. It&#39;s the same with health care. People are price gouging us and instead of fixing it, let&#39;s just use taxes to pay these outages costs. Fuck that, stop these institutes from over charging people.So what I&#39;m hearing Bernie saying is &quot;Make America Great Again.&quot; Where have we heard that before?So much bs and lies, I would have loved to be there and debate him.Bernie sanders has zero knowlege of economics.  The push back on minimum wage increase is that its inflationary.  Tell Bernie to get the government out of education and it would be $9.95/month all you can learn.  If you allow for default in student loans it would creat too  much risk and thus price would drop until it becomes affordable.  ALso, universities are in the landlord game not the education game....There is no gun problem. only 18k people die of gun deaths (40k but half are suicides, some are accidents)It&#39;s time for real, progressive change.This is gonna get hella viewsJoe should’ve pulled out the blunt like he did with ElonHoly shit. I usually only listen to Joe&#39;s Podcasts but I&#39;m definitely going to watch this one. Holy shit, That&#39;s Bernie Sanders.JOE! You need the questions Americans care about!<br />          1) what are we doing about the break away governments <br />          2) how do we stop big tech and globalists from talking to Interdimensional Aliens<br />          3) how do we get rid of human/animal hybrids&quot;We spend 80 Billions dollars to invest in these kids, what does it mean&quot;<br />It means your ideas are shit and throwing money on shit doesn&#39;t generate value.I gotta say. I’m a conservative. At least he’s being honest. I understand it was only an hour and let him speak his position but I really wish a conservative was questioning him and holding him to task. Non combative or interrupting of course. But somethingI&#39;ve told people for over 12 years now, and I am 30 now and learned this when I was 18, so yeah, anyway, I tell many people if we don&#39;t fix our pollution and destructions of echo systems and rain forests and more by the year 2050, maybe even sooner, 30% to 40% of the world will be unhabitable for most species on the planet. So we are pretty fucked if we don&#39;t fix ourselves real soon.Medicare was sold to us as costing $3bn a year in 1965.... it now costs over $60bn per year to fund it. LolTrump 2020 🇺🇸Go Bernie!Who cares? We all know he is not getting the nomination.Joe, please have yang, tulsi and Bernie on at the same time as a no superpac ever open forum discussion. (I left Warren out because she will take  corporate cash in a general).Never been at a gun show in the last 10 years  that allowed you  to buy without a check.These ASMR role play videos are getting out of hand.I voted for trump in 2016 but willing to vote for sandersBernie “Joe Rogan” SandersI disappointed in joe not asking Bernie how many genders there are. Tisk tiskAre people in this comment section on meth? I want to do this/ Ill do this / this is whats wrong... /// HE NEVER SAID HOW HE WOULD DO IT!!! not one tough question!!!!! We had all this time... How Exactly would we accomplish this??? This is a feel good interview with no answers!!! Typical Political B.S. Thanks for nothing J.R.E. !!!!!!! <br />Burney did answer the marijuana question so that&#39;s goodNow we need Trump daddy 😩👌his he going to pull all off our troops out of all wars right now ?amazing video, great to hear bernie talk at length about these issues instead of the 45 second &quot;debate&quot; clipsBirney you are going to lose ... Trump 2020...Well, shit. Now we have to start laying those interns off at the agency.@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m40s">5:40</a> they took their wallet out when they paid taxes bud. It&#39;s not free.Less regulation, lower taxes, create a habitat for business to thrive. That&#39;s all that is needed.loved it allBernie is so hard to listen to...left wing or right wing, I think we can all agree that money needs to leave politicsfuck yeah, feel the bern!Bernie Sanders thinks that greed ruins a country. Name one country that doesn’t run on greed.“We have more people in jail than China” let that sink in lmaoBernie starts off by stealing Yang&#39;s reality TV show reference. LolI&#39;m a libertarian and would never in a million years vote for a Socialist, but this was a great podcast.Canadians come here for medical care, because of the months and months of wait-time necessary to see medical professionals.  I want nothing to do with this democratic socialist - who&#39;s just a socialist.&quot;If you drop out of school, you don&#39;t have an education&quot;<br />About the only way you can get an education is if you drop out of &quot;public&quot; school.My issue isn&#39;t with Bernie, nor am I  afraid of him being a pudding eating Dictator. My issue is when you step foot in the Socialist door there&#39;s always a real lunatic stepping through. So much so that these people form their own socialism like Maoism or Stalinism. Or to the degree that the biggest non medical killer in the 20th century was socialism.I love you bro brogan 🖤🖤🖤Bernie Sanders: The Oldest millennial in America 💜Bernie wants to raise the minimum wage. Maybe start with paying your campaign staff 15$ an hour. Practice what you preach you multi millionaire. He doesn’t care, he’s probably in his vacation home or his mountain house. What a hypocrite.Talking about red flag laws, banning rifles that people use to protect the people they love turning law abiding citizens into felons overnight is where u lost me 🤮👎 he even agreed 99.99% of gun owners will never commit a crime with them yet still wants gun owners to give up there rights nopeThe federal government is far more powerful than any corporation or set of corporationIf he doesn&#39;t get him to blaze I&#39;m DONEThey didn&#39;t sign up you are forced into Medicare and are not allowed to left the Medicare programWait why is this not trending ????If you move from ideas as human rights to actually items like healthcare then you have to force people to provide that care. I don’t know about you Joe but I call slavery pretty radical.If you dont know about Bernie please research, his message has been the same since the 70s. Hes for the peopleI don&#39;t agree with everything this man says he stands for but I agree with enough to vote for him.Bernie in 2016 &quot;We need to go after the millionaires and billionaires.&quot;<br /><br />Bernie in 2020 &quot;We need to go after the billionaires.&quot;<br /><br />It was nice to avoid that whole 2016 DNC primary election rigging question, Joe. Sorry I can&#39;t trust a socialist who owns 3 houses, drives an Audi, and flies first class. I also can&#39;t trust a career legislator who blames private companies for making the law.<br /><br />Also, there is only one legitimate gun law, the 2nd Amendment, and all subsequent gun laws are a violation of it.God damn Bernie is one incredible thinker. He could be an incredible leader. He will be the democratic candidate for president in 2020. Make your choice.Look at Washington State we raised it up to 15 an now mc Donald’s burgers almost 6 bucks for what was a dollar 4 years agoJoe Rogan IS the new Net Work TV. Fuck CBS / NBC / ABC. Honestly. I haven&#39;t had cable in years. Last night I watched Sicario on YouTube for free. I watch the pats and the red sox for free. Project Binky . . . . FREE. I&#39;m still not going to vote for Bernie, but this was a great discussion.Bernie just parrots nonsense... He&#39;s way too old and senile. We have a right to bare arms point blank period.. Most gun violence is done so by gang bangers with illegally obtained gun fohThe US fought Nazi Germany and JAPAN. <br />NOT CHINA. <br />It was JAPAN. <br />FFS.Not sure how you could not like this episode you got the chance to hear reasonable response to most problemsNo fucking chance that guys getting the job.JRE put Andrew Yang on the map. Thanks Joe!See if you can catch it: he picked a bugger and waited a while, then he ate it. It was slick, I had to watch it 4 times to be sure and I&#39;m still not 100%, but I believe that&#39;s what happened. Also, he sounds like that ant eater on pink panther.<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/mlvFucf3dGA">https://youtu.be/mlvFucf3dGA</a>Wealth &amp; economic inequality isn&#39;t partisan. It&#39;s real and it must be addressed or the middle class &amp; opportunity will die along with this country. If you don&#39;t like Sanders - all I ask - think for yourselves &amp; don&#39;t buy into the propaganda by corporations and those who are paid to sell nonsense like &#39;he&#39;s a commie&#39; or &#39;he&#39;s an evil socialist&#39; etc. Etc. We must make dramatic changes in the 🇺🇸 &amp; none of the other politicians currently in office will do anything to change the status quo. We have to get beyond the idea the solutions to address inequality are to simply work harder or that profiting off of suffering in health care is okay. We have a chance to elect someone, Sanders, interested in helping democrats and Republicans.Bernie Beto 2020INFO WARS DOT COM. FOLLOW ALEX JONES TODAY!!!Its really fucking simple berdie Semi auto rifles (what you call assault weapons) are for citizens to keep tyrannical government in check, Learn some history because you are clueless. This guy is dangerous.Less than 12 years... ok.Bernie is a straight up piece of shit who is trying to destroy the country.Two presidents 2020Bernie knows rogan has a large left audience. Still his desperate act to get publicity from joe is sickening on both parts. TRUMP2020. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />TRUMP BITCH TRUMP GONE WIN AGAINYes now Bernie must win to have him be on the podcast and inform us on the spooky aliensdont read the comments theres russian botsJoe, I hope you do this with all the major candidates. I learned more about Bernie today than I have in the past 5 years of sorting through what is true and what isn&#39;t about his campaign.Omg...He couldn&#39;t pay his own campaign staff $15/hr yet wants to burden every business in the country with that foolishness.Just wish Joe would have asked Bernie “ why did you wait til u were 40 to get a job ?”since the area 51 Raid is off we have to elect BernieIf you love government power, this is your guy.  If you love individual freedom, not so much.  He wants Medicare for all, and would deny you the choice to purchase your own policy.  <br />The only reason hospitals and doctors survive today is because of the private insurance system.  If you want to destroy healthcare, create long waits for care, and ration care, go with Bernie “breadlines are a good thing” Sanders.  <br />Real tough interview Rogan.  What a joke.Yesss 🙌 Bernie 2020 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23feelthebern">#feelthebern</a> 🔥 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23notmeus">#notmeus</a> ✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊most guns, minus muzzle loaders, &amp; double barrels are designed to kill folks quite quickly..Joe, im a huge fan and im glad you did this for Bernie. I would also encourage you to reach out to our president. I think you can help clear up the fake news deal with the news channels that are located primarily in sanctuary cities where democrat politicians are alienating their own people. Just like whats happening in Illinois. Illinois was democrat. They show illinois on the map as all blue but sourthern il is all trump supporters. People here work hard and are over taxed. People here LOVE President trump. Up north in chicago they are all democrat making up fake hate crimes. Chicago is not a welcoming city. Atleast not for white people or if you stay in your own zone. Its the people in power like kim fox that shit on their own people like obama did. This is why Kanye west from chicago loves tru p. Help clear up the lying from the left. I can show you proof of what im saying is true. Chicago is the most racist city in the worldPresidential canidates on the show? Joe is power, trump better rebuttle and show up for joes audience. Ron Paul/ventura 2020270 mass shootings in a year Joe? Come on man please don’t propagate that lie.Bernie 2020why are you surprised he is allowing Bernie to speak only Democrats try and shut people up through violence or other means same as Nazis oh and want to take away your guns same as Nazis.....Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang should both be on this show, and explain how they will spend each others money.man... idk I&#39;m a little disappointed. I don&#39;t hear a lot of specificity in these solutions. I agree generally with everything he says, but I want to know HOW he&#39;s going to get these things doneThis might not reach more people, but it will reach those who want to listen. It will allow the voters who want to know about the candidates in a deeper manner, not 30-sec answers and soundbites. We are talking about a person who will lead the country for 4 years. we need to know more about this person and on a deeper level. No scriptwriters, no speeches that have been revised 20 times, just a nice sitdown and good conversation.<br />That&#39;s why I support and enjoy the JRERegardless of what you believe in you can&#39;t deny how genuine and selfless this man&#39;s intentions are.He would be a great psychologist... He sits and talks to Americans and feels there pain. <br />But a terrible politician!No one has a RIGHT to another person&#39;s labor - especially someone who devoted 8 years of schooling + residency + a fellowship👍👍👽✌All the voters are being tricked into electing people who will eventually transfer their wealth to the wealthy.Bernie &quot;I listen to the scientist&quot; SandersI found a signed book by ross pirot in a thrift store in idahoBernie Sanders is the top 1%.He is a millionaire and owns multiple houses. If he truly believes in socialism, then why doesn&#39;t he just keep 10% and give the rest away? He talks about the 1%. HE IS THE 1%. Don&#39;t be fooled. This guy has NEVER held a private sector job. He has always been an elected official. All of his money came from running for office. That&#39;s just not right. That is not &quot;ordinary people&quot;.Do I hit &quot;Like&quot; because I want to support Joe and his channel(s) , or do I hit &quot;Dislike&quot; because I disagree with his guest? The like/dislike only affects the uploader if I&#39;m understanding things correctly? So torn...I wish we could get every candidate on JRE to hear them out without it being a “debate” format that is horrible and ridiculous.He had me till <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=14m59s">14:59</a> Then lost me .. healthcare for all is a right but...This is how the news should be you give a question and the guest gives an answer none of this talking head bullshit twisting everything until it conforms with the narrative they are pushing, both sides are guilty of this and really should be ashamed. Thank You Joe Rogan for being the kind of interviewer that most in media wish they could beWow I was under the idea he was going to make us the new Cuba/Venezuela. Honestly now that I have time to really listen he is just trying to make us Canada 😂. Idk if you&#39;ve been to Canada but it&#39;s pretty fucking awesome.There is no candidate in the 2020 race that is as as committed to his ideals and willing to take on entrenched power as this guy is.  Whether you agree with him about every issue or not, you know where he stands, and you know he won&#39;t go back on his word once elected.  He&#39;s the ONLY one like that.Joe needed him to press him more on the minimum wage argument. Bernie&#39;s &quot;if you own a business and I own a business we are both effected the same way&quot; comment is utter bullsh*t. A local coffee house can not absorb that hit like a Starbucks can.I&#39;m sorry but can you imagine this guy meeting and talking to leaders from other countries, he can hardly make eye contact with Joe Haha. and Damnt would he clear his  Throat! LolThis is interesting, but bernie is part of the dem machine, he plays identity politics like the rest of the candidates (Except Tulsi and Yang)<br /><br />Bernie isn&#39;t the same since 2016, he should have never gave hillary his approval after getting cheated out.<br /><br />He is still in love with the now dead soviet union, that will never happen in the US.<br /><br />Oh god, bernie talking about &quot;Assualt weapons&quot; (None exist legally in the U.S. due to the fact we have made automatic firing weapons illegal since 1930&#39;s)<br /><br />My mind isn&#39;t changed about him, he is part of the ivory tower elite liberal class.I don&#39;t agree with Bernie on everything, but I&#39;m glad that he came on the JRE. <br /><br />Politics is being reduced to sound bits, but hearing politicians expand on their ideas helps everyone to  make more informed voting decisions.<br /><br />Joe might not agree with him on everything either, but he&#39;s at least giving politicians a platform that they can&#39;t get anywhere else.What a foolNot saying that I didn&#39;t enjoy the show but god damn!!! KAG2020!!!!I&#39;m a Berner so I&#39;m biased, but I do hope this video shows that Bern does have a way to pay for his proposals, and thank you again to Joe Rogan for the nuance and the platform. Much appreciated!crazy bernie.. your plans are naive. your ideas are all pipedreams and unexecutable. zees.  complete socialist and he doesnt know it. damn it<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> Accept no less this time!I honestly believe both these men are more intelligent than me im not educated. But on the other hand what they are saying seems extremely ignorant.Great job Mr. Rogan, I love the platform you give people to speak onMn are is way better than medicare,includes glasses for 25 and 5 bucks a mo. Should give that to america. I am on medicare and it pays for NO medication,no glasses,it sucks because I a not buy insulin,can not afford it.This is fucking amazing.Ask Bernie how long do they have to wait for that heart surgery. A lot of Canadians get major surgeries in the U.S.💯💯🇺🇸💯🇺🇸<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=16m20s">16:20</a> Agender. Twice.Bernie 2020Bernie has had a long political career - without accomplishing hardly anything. Read up on this yourself... he successfully name 2 post offices out of the 7 bills that has been passed under his name. 909 submitted. Barely rounds UP to a 1% Success Rate. No Thank YouThis was a criminally short podcast though.Bernie Sanders is truly the most &quot;for the people&quot; politician we have  seen, basically ever. Based on his substance, there are so many legitimate ways he wants to help so many people and it is crazy to me how many haters he has. So many people just don&#39;t want good things and realness. <br /><br />No way he can win. Only because the evils across the world that run things won&#39;t allow this &#39;good guy&#39; character to be on top. <br /><br />He calls out every injustice across the board and many don&#39;t hear. <br /><br />I applaud this man&#39;s courage and Joe &amp; team are really pushing the boundaries of this mediaI enjoy capitalism, and I’m between Bernie Sanders and Tulsi GabbardI have a question for those that think that healthcare is a right. <br />Is food also a human right?I feel the BernDon&#39;t you Bernie fans remember how Hillary bent Bernie over with a strap on in 2016, hes a scared little bitchSocialist dont love the poor. They hate those richer than them. <br />Hence Bernie&#39;s obsession with the rich and wealth.He still is crazy anti gun 🤮This guy is very good in telling half Truth and lies and socialismTHIS DA TYPE PROPAGANDA I FUCKS WIT YA DIGPlease research. Don’t believe everything you hearCool that joe got Bernie on, still voting Trump but this is cool 😎BOOOOOOOOOOO!BERNIE! WHATTTT?The debates are worthless.  This is worth your time!Sure come to Canada take our cheap drugs back over the border but when i want 48 beer i pay duties on 24 of them or get them taken awayBernie the type of guy to read comments before watchingI would spend an evening having a beer with Mr. Sanders, but I wouldn&#39;t want him running the country. I would not want to spend an evening with Mr. Trump, but I&#39;m okay with him running things. That&#39;s an important difference.Dude can&#39;t even lift his headAgree with the man or not, this was an excellent discussion.So authentic! Bernie2020Still not sure I’m buying into what he’s sayingI promising unicorns and cotton candy for everyone! Vote for me!VOTE FOR BERNIE SO HE CAN REVEAL ALIENS ON JRECan’t wait to listen to this while playing my OSRS Ironman!Seems like a genuinely nice guy, but I just don&#39;t agree with his politics.Bernie Sanders is a good, logical, caring person &amp; I bet a whole lot of people gained a new-found respect for him today when they saw this interview.Just clicked the video....I hope Joe asks the right questions and not blow it like he did with the Twitter guyWe have the ability to elect Doc from Back to the Future, we must do anything we can.Holy crab nuggets! Bernie on JRE!Bernie: The US is the only major developed country where the pharmaceutical industry cant have negotiated prices and people pay 10x as more for the same medication found in other countries. That is wrong.<br /><br />MAGA FANBOY: COmMunIsT!!!Welcome to Bernie Sanders folks, pull up a chair.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m40s">34:40</a> lolJoe: How is that legal?<br />Bernie: Money.<br />Joe: How is that legal, tho?<br />Bernie: Money...<br />Joe: But how is that legal, tho?<br />Bernie: <b>MONEY!!!!</b> <br />Joe: Yeah, but, how is all this legal?<br />Bernie: DMT, Joe.<br />Joe: Ohhhhh.I thought Joe was gonna spark a TysonSo how much did joe have to donate to grandpa bernzeRaising taxes on the middle class is radical 💯💯💯🤙🏼🤙🏼Bernie looking burnt out IMO Yang only guy who can beat trump 1v1 rest of these democrats are pussiesStuck to the play book.Big Daddy Bernie!!!I&#39;m a conservative, I dont agree with his policies, but my goodness he seemed very put together and I appreciated it! <br /><br />-PS. Bernie thinks we were at war with Germany and china😂😂😂😂He has a lot of amazing ideas but it sounds extremely expensive, Even if we tax the 1% 60-80% it still sounds undoable. I think if a lot of these ideas were possible some of them would have already happened,.Great interview Joe. Long form. Uninterrupted. This is how Americans should be able to listen and understand the candidates. Please do more of these with the other candidates.Bernie Sanders for President, wow what a legend!Yang2020It was only an hour cus he needed his afternoon napBern still sharp between the ears rattilng off accurate stat after statI really liked the part where I had to pause because my dog peed on the floor. Did enjoy this.A Bernie presidency means to me is that our tax dollars will go back to the people and not to corporate welfare and the military industrial complex.  Bernie 2020🔥Canada&#39;s quality of care is not nearly as good as America&#39;s. I for one have not even been able to find a family doctor in Vancouver since mine retired a few years ago. Also, his claim that you can see any doctor you want is bogus. I recently talked to a family friend who waited months for cataract surgery. The real tradeoff is availability vs cost and Canada spends less but they also get much less.  Also, little known issue is Canada is subsidized for medication because all the major drug companies recoup their R&amp;D from America. If America were to do the same the money would have to come from somewhere else. You could force pharmaceutical companies to drop their prices but inevitably you&#39;d have less new medications. It&#39;s high-risk and high-reward. Plenty of pharmaceutical companies have gone out of business but you never hear about them.<br /><br /><br />Not saying America&#39;s system can&#39;t be improved, but I don&#39;t think socializing it is a good long-term solution.O no he said a war with China in WW2 nooo!!!😳😭😭I used to think Bernie was just a well intentioned disaster but after an hour of hearing him I now realize that he&#39;s worse. <br /><br />I see that he can identify problems but all of his plans to address them are extremely harmful. <br /><br />The government shouldn&#39;t be in charge of determining who is mentally capable of owning a firearm. The rules in place are fine, any restrictions more than that are unconstitutional. <br /><br />His economic plan is a dumpster fire that will undoubtedly send us into another depression and further more would prevent people from lifting themselves out of poverty. Government gate keeping in the market is going hurt everyone because he obviously has no clue what he is doing. <br /><br />His typical socialist rhetoric just evolved into full blown Communism. &quot;It&#39;s all about power that&#39;s why I&#39;m going to use the presidency to take that power.&quot; Yeah and screw everything up like all dictators do. <br /><br />I get that people want legal pot but in exchange for what? No gun rights? A busted economy? A Maduro style dictator that will force companies to comply with stupid policies like $15 minimum wage? What about the small mom and pop shops all over America that can&#39;t afford the wage increase? Taxes on stocks that inflate when the market does well, so now the bar to entry in the stock market is even higher? Yeah that will totally help Americans get out of poverty... So basically there will be no incentive to buy shares because the government will just skim all of the profit off of the top... Bernie Sanders commie pig 2020...The wealth inequality is from the lack of property ownership of younger generations. The boomers started this housing price boom and now it&#39;s to expensive for the people who grow up there. They bought up all the land and turned everyone to renters. When you rent you will always be paying for someone else to live.HOW ABOUT WE START WITH THE TRUTH. The aggregate (cumulative) loan limit is $138,500, including undergraduate debt (and no more than $65,500 in Direct Subsidized Loans). Medical school and health professions students may borrow up to $40,500 per year and have an aggregate loan limit of up to $224,000.Anybody else feelin&#39; the Bern? 🔥Just went through 300 top comments and not one was anti sanders. Google really doesn&#39;t give a damn how obvious they are.I swear to goodness, if Bernie doesn’t take a smoke I want my money back!Bernie talks like he&#39;s stuck between downs syndrome and cerebral palsy...fuckin gun grabber. fuck himi&#39;m disappointed in Bernie not stating Automation is the main cause of Entry level job loss. He said china.  Automation is 80% compare to 20% for globalization.  Bernie ,please visit silicon valley or Shenzhen so that you can learn about what tech will do to most jobs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>Joe should have candidates on for a long form debate on the show. A 2 hour discussion between 2 candidates would provide more insight than any other medium in the history of this country. Would love to see Joe try and make this happenWizard level Bernie! Careful soy suckers, this guy will leave all of America in the debt of his hysterical utopiaAmazon employees payed taxes ! If Amazon didn&#39;t Employ those people there would be unemployed not paying any taxes, so yah , Amazon doesn&#39;t pay taxes but generates thousands of Jobs that pay taxes  !Socialist Bernie gone WildeListen to Trump speak for 1+ hour. <br />Now listen to Bernie speak for this 1+ hour. <br /><br />Is it really that hard of a choice?  <br /><br />BERNIE 2020 🇺🇸💪🏿You can&#39;t make healthcare cheaper if you don&#39;t deregulateSwitching to a better energy is a no brainer, but until it is feasible.. trying to switch to early will just cripple the united states. Solar technology isn&#39;t ready, wind power doesn&#39;t provide enough everywhere, dams can&#39;t be everywhere, democrats do not want nuclear. It just isn&#39;t feasible yet.Feel the bern baby... this guy make sense, it’s just common sense .Whether you agree or disagree with his polices... nobody can factually deny that he’s genuine and wants to help people.I’ve seen ads all week about how Bernie wants a 15 dollar minimum wage but he won’t pay his staffers and joe didn’t question him on it lmaoBernie bro have you not checked into the countries that have to wait 6 months to get an X-ray? That&#39;s what socialist healthcare does! You claim it&#39;s the best but they all come here to get treatment!Joe through softballs the entire time<br /> I&#39;m somewhat disappointed.Yang and Gabbard are still polling at 1% after the first two debates. Sorry but history shows that candidates in that situation at this point in time stand no chance. <br /><br />With that said, I’ll be voting Bernie in the general, even if I have to write him in.So many shills in this comment section🤦‍♂️Andrew Yang should do another episode here, Johan Hari too lolBernie 2020 baby!Hopefully this will encourage more politicians to get on Joe&#39;s show.If the DNC hadn&#39;t cheated Bernie out of the nomination, millions of Trump voters would have voted for him instead. He would have won by a landslide.I like tulsi and yang, but will settle for bernie. If all goes well of course......<br /><br /><br />But lowkery felt bernie answered every question with ... we need to fix the income inequality gap and make healthcare affordable for all. Then again these are still good things to be concerned aboutI used to feel the Bern but the extreme left and their identity politics ran away with him.Bernie had to leave after an hour. Didnt wanna miss his nap before Jeopardy and the Wheel.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NoToSocialism">#NoToSocialism</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>Not funny, Didn&#39;t laugh 😐Thank you for having Bernie on!Very informative ,we need to deal with the situation  nowOnly here for the comment section. This old creepy communist is batshit crazy.Time to elect a Mensch to run this country and make America finally greatI had to stop watching when Bernie started talking about forcing private media organizations to air political propaganda.  I&#39;m sorry but it you think this is reasonable you&#39;re evil.Joe didn’t press him with any legitimate rebuttals. Disappointing. Esp with the minimum wage... smhWow this was AwesomeBefore 500kTrump this, trump that.. answer the questions BernieThis slimy ass politican kept ignoring questions he didnt like and gave half answers. Would u forcibly take guns from people? Mmm well i dont think people should have assault weapons. Joe asks again and bernie completley avoids answering it again because he knows it would involve police using violence against citizens to saitisy his gun grabbingBernie honeymooned in The Soviet Union after his wedding in 1988. If anyone is under Russian influence...I wish Joe asked harder questions like why he let HRC steal his nomination, Or why he doesn&#39;t address antifa and it&#39;s ties to the left and the problem with identity politicsthat woman from last night has a tough life, she has ptsd, was in a mass shooting, a doctor, has 300k in dept but paid under minimum wage and cant afford healthcareSo many comments with critiques that Bernie addressed in the pod. I guess you can lead a horse to water but you can&#39;t make them drink.Shit the fuck yeah! Sanders/Gabbard 2020Bernie wants a trade tax on the stock market?  So, when we buy stock in our 401k, that&#39;s considered a trade?Joe Rogan has so much pull, this guy can get anyone on his show. Bernie definitely made the right decision to go on, he&#39;s gonna reach an entirely different audience who would otherwise be stuck on Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder.Other countries like Cuba you fucking communist??I&#39;m not even from the US, but I would say in my honest opinion that most of the issues that Joe asked about, would eventually be solved by a change in the economic system, from corruption, climate change and poverty, to even depression and mass shootings, I mean, the way people live, act and think in US (and in the world since most countries are a product of the US), it&#39;s a direct result from the consumerist economic system. Also I wouldn&#39;t say that we need to take money from the top percent and give it to the others, that&#39;s naive, but a periodic evolution in the system which allows each problem to start solving itself by the previous one, starting on the aim of the economy which is not quality of life. Let&#39;s discuss :)Nothing against Bernie Sanders, but Yang Gang is where it&#39;s atBernies been bought before it can happen again. You do not want a man that can be bought running the country. He should have won the dem elect in 2016. He sold out to fit the agenda. Now healthcare issues yes big pharma is a huge problem i agree also hes dead wrong on his firearms argument. There is still an ugly agenda in the wake of the dem party. Imo tulsi is the best dem bet and actually the most sane idealist to run the country.Joe you have no tough questions your out of touch maybe your star struck maybe you should ask Tim Pool or Ben Shapiro to help youbut were is MY PUDDING!!!I love this guy. The guy still has hope and a heartFUCK YAFREE AIR TIME IN OTHER COUNTRIES <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m30s">2:30</a> // Working for a radio station for 10 years, I know how much candidates pay for commercials. By law they get the lowest rate paid on any broadcast media and they can&#39;t be denied due to clean election laws. I.e if you sell a 30 second commercial form $5 when normally it is $80 that means they (ANY candidate) can buy an equivalent spot for the same price. Basically your inventory is Fucked and your commision check looks pathetic. If the boss catches you low balling during an election year you might as well fire yourself. <br /><br /><br />Also 30 second spots are sold in month packages ranging from $1,000 to $20,000 depending on frequency and time of day.The thing that I love about Joe is that he knows when to just listen.....This podcast is one of your best!  Thanks!What do People not understand about the big wealthy corporations being the reason we live so well in this country.my boy always talking to someone 😂Bernie Sanders is certainly not my candidate. I know that completely because I was able to hear him honestly, calmly, and clearly. I&#39;m glad Joe didn&#39;t really push him. I got genuine conversation. I won&#39;t like everyone, but it&#39;s important to know them as best as possible. Thank you to both Joe and Bernie for giving us this moment.YaaasssWay to let him off the hook on almost everything. Joe didn&#39;t ask any tough questions and didn&#39;t dive deeper on anything. He gave nothing but surface answers that would have caused his platform to fall apart. Or maybe Joe just didn&#39;t feel the need to press because everything he heard already agrees with his belief system. Confirmation bias.He said we all need to help he can’t do<br />It alone but all together that’s how a leader talks! All<br />Helping each other!The ex-tablishment is pushing phony bidenTrump retarded ass would have said I can fix it! Bernie is the real deal and most likely will vote for him✊ However, I also love my guns and will not give them up for shit!Bernie should be President <br />FULL STOP 🛑raising the minimum will naturally raise the expectations of every employee on the payroll.. fast forward, McDonalds replaces disgruntled, old, entry-level / life-long career employees with a giant iPhone kiosk programmed to say thank you. Chik-Fil-a says &quot;its my pleasure&quot;The first add on this was for an anxiety medication ironicWhere was Jamie? Half the shit he said was false!Everyone in here saying “I’m a conservative but”<br /><br />But what? This guy tweets about taking away guns. He supports ridiculous high taxes. I could go on and on. Dudes a big hypocrite too.THATS ALOTA DISLIKES, more than usual....I really like this guy. Not just his policies, which are great, but his no-bullshit attitude and how passionate he is about doing right by the people. He&#39;s not sidestepping questions, he gives specifics, he calls out the corruption that&#39;s running rampant through our system, and he even admits that he can&#39;t actually do anything he wants to do unless he gets some serious backing from the American people. Most politicians will just say &quot;yeah I can fix it&quot; but he&#39;s being real and saying &quot;no, WE need to fix it, because I can&#39;t do it alone.&quot; Dude has my respect and my vote.Hows that free healthcare working out in other countries?? Wonder why Canadians come to the US for surgeries?? The level of care and wait time is shitThis dope seems to forget that the second ammendment was put into place to protect us from our own oppressive government.Foreign policy, education reform and criminal justice reform. End the wars, take government out of the schools and make school cheaper and make drugs legal.Did Bernie just say after Pearl Harbour the US was fighting the Chinese? Um...love you Bernie but brush up on your history...Holy shit. Just holy shitI think Joe should also get more political candidates on both sides so everyone can have a better understanding on what these candidates are pushing forINSULIN PRICES!! PREACH IT BROTHERBERN THE FERN BABY!!!Bernie Sanders doesn&#39;t do eye contact with Joecant wait for trump to win again. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bernie I just talked to a woman Sanders.Insight from Israel: nearly free healthcare is great. No assault weapons for citizens is great. It can be done. Low cost high education is great. It can be done. We have all of those.It&#39;s sad that Gabbard (the only candidate I&#39;d support) isn&#39;t getting attention like the other Democrats.Did anyone else notice how he didn&#39;t answer Joe&#39;s question? &quot;The $69 billion, the resources; how do we stop them?&quot; Sanders isn&#39;t trying to stop him, he&#39;s just the brand new face of their propaganda machine.<br /><br />Because, when millions of people are of one mind, they are much stronger and at the same time much easier to control and manipulate and that&#39;s the one thing the ruling class needs. At this point in the Empire game, whichever ruling class is in place and they know that other revolts is coming Alma they&#39;re smart enough to understand that to resist it means death and the best thing to do is to Rebrand your image and make it seem like you are a part of the new crowd and then simply watch the old dictatorship or oligarchy or whatever image that they may have a, they just need to wait their time and watch it die away. While the whole time they were always in power and they will remain in power until people realize that we don&#39;t need a government to tell us how to live. But people are stupid and they will always succumb to the concept of authorityJoe asked about aliens! Hell yeah, Joe, love it, amazing way to close out this bad ass podcast. This was great. Keep doing your thing, man.So many thumbs down. I’m a conservative but I’m not a snowflake lmao. I just realized there’s a lot of snowflakes on both sides alike.I live in Canada... believe me it is not better here ! You get what you pay for with health care ! ... that&#39;s why alot of us go down there and pay for surgeries!This was amazing, Joe. he&#39;s got my vote &amp; I&#39;m in Tennessee 👏VOTE*BERNIE*2020!!!I feel like this was a politician’s first chance in a long time to be honest with viewers. For the first 16 minutes Mr. Sanders talked about the corruption of the health care industry and what he wants to do with health care in the United States. But at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=16m14s">16:14</a> Joe asked him if he was president what he do to fix it, and instead of giving policy he listed off a bunch of other issues he wants to fix. With only one actual plan to hold a rally in Kentucky if Mitch doesn’t play ball with a higher minimum wage. I am a little disappointed with that.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=32m30s">32:30</a>   i would be lying if i said i had a magical answer😂😂😂     you have a fairytale magic answer for everything elseBernie: “America is corrupt”<br />Joe: “how is that legal?” <br />😂Wwwwwwwwwwwwoooooooooowwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!This needed to happen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>What tiny bit of respect I had for Joe just died. He does still do give a good interview to a point but to much placating. Thinking healthcare is a right is huge fail. All the soft talk in the world doesn&#39;t change the fact that Bernie is a scumbag politician that isn&#39;t against power. He&#39;s just wants the power to push his insane ideology. He&#39;s always saying the government is corrupt but wants to expand it. Joe didn&#39;t push him on anything.The MSM is dead, dead, dead.Hospitals  over charge way to much for carewhy is this comment section just circlejerking that he&#39;s here and not talking about the important shit he&#39;s saying?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h01m15s">1:01:15</a> - It&#39;s LITERALLY come down to. FOSSIL FUELS DIES OR WE ALL DIE. Personally, I say those giant billionaire corps can fuck off &amp; die, since we would still, even if Bernie wins &amp; pushes his plan forward, would have a pretty small chance of survival for most of the human race!!America should regain the respect it deserves by electing a honest and truly caring president like this man or any other true person... Trump is a joke, America has a looooot better to offer as leader of the free world!this guy needs to get gassedHate or love Sanders, we need a president as passionate as him about fixing the issues our country facesLook at the like to dislike ratio, after all the right wing base that Joe built up, still, progressives are on top!!!Bernie &quot;I&#39;ll erase your student loan debt if you turn in your gun&quot; SandersDamn Joe you brought this clown in? Must be a slow week...Raising minimum wage won&#39;t help when 50% of your money goes to taxes to pay for your free health care and your free education lolI wish Bernie had the time to go into personal stories because he has lead an interesting life. Thanks Joe.Have trump onHello my fellow kids, how do you do? <b>rides in on skateboard</b><br /><br />Bernie is a conman, and his fans are too stupid to realize itWhen the number of candidates narrows down, it would be very cool if Joe invited them onto the podcast for a debate/discussion like he&#39;s done with scientists in the past.If we can’t create genius and happy youngsters by the age of 17, then we better re-evaluate our education strategy.If you are older than 18 an still make Min Wage then you are doing something wrong ! and if you are having a family on a min wage job that&#39;s not societies fault !Craig J.

Millionaire Bernie that doesn&#39;t pay his fair share?? DNC Burned Bernie?? And what&#39;s to increase taxes to the middle class Bernie??<br />Praising Communism Bernie???<br />NahhhhhAll he is talking about, is bringing the middle class, down to meet the lower class. Paying $15 an hour to unskilled burgerflipper, isn&#39;t going to force the plumbing business paying their employees an average of $20 an hour now for SKILLED labor, up to $30 an hour. You talk about inflation. This will tank the fucking economy and make the dollar worthless. This isn&#39;t going to work, by simply taxing the fuck out of the 1% either. Do you really think that the fat cats aren&#39;t going to pass those expenses on to the consumer?? You are out of your mind. The only way to reel in big business at this point, is at gunpoint. And that is EXACTLY what Hitler did. It&#39;s called NATIONAL Socialism, not Democratic Socialism.<br />EDIT: Oh, and p.s., he also crashed the stock market about 3 or 4 times in this hour with these ideas.Class war, fuck yeah!I don’t think another candidate would dare to have long form dialogue like this. Conservative or Liberal. Bernie automatically has my respect, maybe a vote too.You should’ve smoked a J with him Joe.This is one of, if not the shortest Joe Rogan podcast ever.Every deadbeat is gonna love this! Free stuff for everyone! What happened to the American Dream, and being self-responsible?

Only candidate who has ZERO donations from billionaire and corporationsBernie &quot;Assault Weapons&quot; SandersBERNIE 2020!! Get the vote out people. Thank you! ❤Every time I hear Bernie Sanders speak uninterrupted, I end up thinking there is still hope for the World. ...Joe &quot;Fuck The Mainstream Media&quot; RoganAndrew Yang 2020!!Impressive Joe, very impressive.The fact that I got to listen to both of you have this discussion tonight has made me so so happy in a way you cant even imagine. Joe asked all the right questions about very hard topics plaguing the minds of millions, maybe even a billion people globally and personally i think Burnie did a wonderful job responding to his questions very thoughtfully. Good job to both of you.Man the Bern makes Murica sound like a hell holeInterviews like this are what&#39;s cementing Joe as one of the best interviewers in modern media.power to the people. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23feeltheBern">#feeltheBern</a>What I took away from this is...<br /><br />Weed for guns 🤷‍♂️Bernie just said three words I&#39;ve never heard a politician say that have won my support, &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. This man is genuine. I hope to vote for him in 2020.Rogan and the communist this is going to be very interestingBernie is the fucking man. Joe, thank you.Excuse me? Who makes the laws again?

Let&#39;s see if he gets a Democrat and a Republican candidate on the show too.I&#39;m not trash talking, he has come out and said he is a socialist.pretty crappy episodeThis should be amazeballs . Spliff ready <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23politricks">#politricks</a> timeOn Medicare for all....so he wants us to trade one master for another.  How about none?  Eliminate import restrictions on pharmaceuticals and eliminate 3rd party payor in routine healthcare and require published pricing.  Make health insurance function like actual insurance... unforeseen events (cancer, heart disease, stroke, broken bones, etc).  Just think, what would auto insurance look like if you mandated it cover all repair and maintenance expenses?<br /><br />For uninsurable, provide a catastrophic plan without exclusion for preexisiting conditions to not distort the underwriting for private health insurance.  Throw in an HSA style account to fund those that truly can&#39;t afford basic healthcare (so they can individually benefit from their thrift) along with that catastrophic plan. <br /><br />I&#39;m sure the ideas could be tweaked quite a bit, but the objective should be to eliminate the black box that insurance companies have created, the restricted competition in Rx, and put more choice back in the hands of patients so that they can actually shop between providers.<br /><br />Bottom line, government being the overlord for healthcare IS radical.  An actual free market with true insurance and a safety net for poor and uninsurable is not.<br /><br />Nobody knows how to answer this complex question because no central committee could possible begin to effectively manage such a system.  It&#39;s amazing how these people see all the wonders that are created wherever a free market exists (or more free I suppose) and then decide that healthcare shouldn&#39;t benefit from this and the experts can top down manage this amazingly complex system.  The arrogance is astounding.🐐 bernie/tulsi 2020 🐐Bernie seemed to be pretty receptive to your input, Joe. Maybe next time throw yourself in there a little more.Guns sre not the problem.This comment section is a dumpster fire of Stockholm Syndrome afflicted muricans.awsome, invite Trump next 👍🏽Holy shit! I can’t wait to watch this!!I&#39;m kinda taken by all the Americans on here saying they&#39;ve never heard Bernie speak.. And the people who say they&#39;re &#39;conservative&#39;, but enjoyed hearing about his platform. With new information, basic intelligence should lead you to change your point of view. No one has to live their whole life sticking to one political party.IDK about you but if 150 million people listen to JRE ..this dude might had just won 2020Bernie thinks he got canada health care figured out sure its nice if you get a emergency surgery you have no bill but god for bid you need a MRI and have to wait 6 months to get one and your cancer becomes terminalWhy is Bernie and all the Bernie fans still ok with the DNC after what they did to him in 2016? 🤔<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m17s">23:17</a> Bernie, have a toke bro. Chill. <br />He&#39;s right thoFinally. A Bernie Podcast.I know some people really want Joe to go hard and challenge the presidential candidates, and that&#39;s would be good too, but I like this format where they are just to to talk. You get to see a different side of them.Bernie 2020Great interview. <br /><br />1. The interview should have been 2 hours minimum .   (Probs Bernie’s fault)<br /><br />2. Joe should have been a tad tougher. What Bernie needs, if he is going to win, is a fair hearing.  <br /><br />Just as Jack Dorsey got.Thank you Joe and thank you Bernie!Amazing episode!Ooohhh shiiitDid Bernie just say that the US fought China after pearl harbour? <br /><br />How do ppl take this guy seriously?love u the showBreadline Bernie!the further you go into right wing ideology, the closer you get to the ultimate boogeyman, the jews. on your way towards that ultimate end goal, you&#39;ll see blame aimed at the negro, the mexican, and the muslim.<br /><br /><br />the further you go to the left, you end up at the billionaire.<br /><br /><br />society is being divided into those who believe the problem are billionaires in society , or jews in society.<br /><br /><br />centrists hold the middle ground for now , but when push comes to shove, youll have some centrists joining one wing or the other.Bernie needs a vacationYep I&#39;m feeling the Bern.<br /><br /> Damn even if you are a republican, please just register as Dem to vote for him in the primary then you can switch back to republican if you want. Because the Dem party hates him so much they will sink to any low to prevent him from winning the Dem nomination.This is a wonderful long form interview with the most important man in America. We need to listen and listen carefully. If you are not worth millions of dollars then this is the guy for whom you should vote.Oh my godAah hell nahDoes Bernie not know what an assault weapon is?Holy shit you got Bernie on your show 👏👏I know most of those dislikes come from the Centrist Democratic Mainstream LeftJoe has only had on 3 of the 20+ candidates in the race. All 3 were Progressives and there is only 5 Progressives running. I would like to see him have some of the others and hold there feet to the fire on the tough issues.But dems are for higher taxes. I’m so confused.Joe, you&#39;ve reached a new low.... You have no idea how economics works.... Nor do you realize the negative impact it will have on future generations, who already are snowflakes, and don&#39;t take personal responsibility (i.e if you borrow money, you have to pay it back. Whether its from an individual or the government. Its called being an adult.)... Giving out handouts, wiping out student loan debt, etc., just puts the needle a little further closer to the breaking point.... All democratic policies are GARBAGE... Just look at all the states/cities these people &quot;govern&quot; and they are the poorest of the poor, both economically and socially.... But maybe thats the elites plan to keep people begging for a little square piece of government cheese every month.... Bernie is a fine example, of what NOT to believe... Hes going on and on about a $15/hr minimum wage for UNSKILLED workers, yet, he couldn&#39;t even pay his own staffers that same wage, and expected them to work overtime for less money (no time in a half-just straight time).... Also, he&#39;s been in congress for 30+ years... Name me one piece of legislation that had a positive impact that this man introduced or eventually got signed into law?! Go ahead, I&#39;ll wait...................................................................................................... Hes a lifelong socialist, who wants to tare down capitalism and replace it with socialism/communism....Hold the corporations that sold the gun accountable. Someone kills with a weapon they sold they pay all the insurance out amd they pay for all the damages...it will end up solving itself really fast...watch and see!!!I’m Canadian and I gotta say in Ontario healthcare isn’t free I had to pay 75 bucks for my room but besides room it’s fine quality is mediocre but honestly Canada is the bestObama, during his presidency, would create this illusion that he was trying really hard to help create healthcare and end wars, but was helpless to take on the system. In reality, he took money from banks for the general in 2008 (after initially promising to only take public funding) and let Citibank select the majority of his cabinet when he started in 2009, and ended up slowly creating a cobbled healthcare act that was built more like a cable company system with companies having ACA monopolies in certain counties. He said that invading Libya was his shame as president. It should be; he knew he gave the order to invade the country because Libya wanted to create its own gold-backed currency. I hope it does eat him away that Libya is a failed state with open slave markets thanks to the administration&#39;s illegal invasion, because it&#39;s not as though he will ever fear even a slap on the wrist. Never trust any candidate who takes super-PAC and lobbyist money. If you want someone who actually will try to help the people, you will get genuine results.i was just hoping joe and bernie would smoke togetherHe looks like he hasn&#39;t much time leftRaise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour? Small business companies will fold and a gallon of milk will cost 7 bucks..  Its all relevant. Wage goes up, products go up.. Explain please..Fckn Fraud Bernie the c0nWe need to get Alex Jones and Bernie Sanders on the podcast at the same timeI dislike this mother fucker but he’s a real one for coming into this podcast.Can you please have somebody on to respond to some of this stuff? He basically answered &quot;money and power&quot; to every question, and he outright avoids giving you the real answer. I know the answer to half of these things and I&#39;m not even running for president. This dude creeps me out a little. I know he knows the answer to these questions.Still don’t agree with his policies but I came away impressed with Saunders. I’d take him(along with Yang and Tulsi) over any of the crazies aka every other Dem candidate.Bernie has had the same platform for over 40 years. Amazing human being who fights for the proletariat.So smart when I’m stoned.Tell Bernie any of these candidates can put there own videos out on YouTube saying what your going to doVote for Bernie, who unlike Trump, is actually consistent (because his beliefs aren&#39;t derived from how they impact his reputation/ego) and he&#39;s not a <b>fake</b> populistThe chicken coop know as the U.S.A. is empty and the fox is already off in the night. The Don will be re-elected in 2020 and there is absolutely nothing Bernie or anyone else can do about it - PERIODBernie Sanders is as real as a politician can be. Joe is undoubtedly one of the most influential guys in the world right now.Joe should host long form debates with the candidatesFucking great job bringing Bernie on your showPreventative medicine will save us so much money on Healthcare our current Healthcare system is not incentivised to do thisAlso, 2A is supported by 10A.FEEL THE BERN!The Government funds research on College Campuses and then the Private sector gets the patent to make a Trillion no breaks for usJoe didn&#39;t ask Bernie about his opinions on chimps, wolves, or DMT. 0/10 podcastGawd no, not this puppet.Listen the real winner might be Burnie but I&#39;m just saying but the deep thoughts like this are wasted on Trump people  because of our gun crazymind set  I&#39;m a right leaning guy but if he says n dose what he says  I&#39;m switching rn cuz I know most people are ok with weapons and we need to fix the stupid shit with our inequality cuz I&#39;m sick off working 70hrs a week for 100 bucks I&#39;m killing my self for the rich I won&#39;t have it anymoreThe DNC royally f*<b>**</b> Bernie in 2016. If that didnt happen he’d be the President at this moment.No concession on the 2nd Amendment.  We&#39;ve already given up too much.  The 2nd Amendment is not for hunting, it&#39;s the last resort to protect all the rest of the Bill of Rights.  They&#39;re not assault weapons.  Assault weapons are automatic weapons, these are not automatic weapons.  They&#39;re .223 cal rifles that look scary.  That&#39;s all.  My hunting rifles shoot much more powerful rounds.I like Bernie, but if you want to make more money you should acquire additional skills. Working for minimum wage sucks. It’s suppose to motivate you to work your way up and not be stuck at that income level your whole life. There’s also regional differences in cost of living that should be taken into account.Lee syatt should moderate the next debate . every canidate takes 50mgs every 30 minuetsInteresting that he didn&#39;t mention the extreme wait times for medical care  experienced by Canadians or the number of Canadians  that travel to the US for decent health care. Socialism doesn&#39;t work.&quot;You can come here and talk uninterrupted for as long as you want &quot; ...... Ad in 3, 2, 1&quot;Everyone&#39;s online today....&quot; I would gladly watch a series of long-form YouTube videos from candidates on their positions, solutions, and implementation strategies.  This seemingly is the easiest thing candidates can do to reach a larger audience.  I&#39;d live with the highly produced and edited versions but I would prefer simple long-form editorials on specific, universal issues.How the fuck are you going to stop someone from doing things on the black market? They couldnt even stop drugs or liqueur.Ive never heard Bernie not yellBeen watching JRE for a while and this is my favorite episode so far. Hope Bernie wins, most genuine guy.I absolutely agree with the money that goes into nuclear weapons. Why the FUCK are we wasting so much money on weapons that will someday kill millions?!?!? Ps. 1941 the enemy to the west was japan not China BernieWatching them discuss the over prescription of pharmaceuticals, then YouTube plays a drug ad.....So much was just objectively false in this. The only thing the guys got right is closing tax loopholes and ending lobbying.FUCK SOCIALISM35ish min mark..... this is a man who has either never bought a gun, or is lying. Anyone who has ever purchased a firearm legally knows how many questions/checks are preformed before you can leave with your firearm. Also the term &quot;assault weapon&quot; is just retarded, it is only used as a trigger word for people who are ignorant of guns in general.                                  (side note) iraqveteran8888 made a great video in response to these shootings that people should watch.Well done by Rogan, got him to answer at least some answers with specifics, like how to pay for free public education.Love Bernie! So glad you had him on for as long as you have, Joe. I agree with everything he said.Our only hope.27 minutes in. Agree with Bernie on the undue influence of lobbyists but not sure he understands how subsidies actually makes things more expensive. No such thing as &#39;free&#39; and taxing the wealthy at even 100% doesn&#39;t cover it.I&#39;m not a Joe Rogan fan but I want to hear Sanders.How can anyone take this fool seriously after praising the Soviet system?But Bernie; none of you explain how you will fix our problems.I’m not proud to admit it but not ashamed to said. I’m not the most politically savvy, or knowledge  person, but DAMN IT, THIS WAS VERY INTERESTING and INFORMATIVE. <br /><br />Gives more insight, and perspective than what you see in the news.Literally zero percent compliance with New Zealand’s gun ban.  Good luck in America 😂Joe &quot;what could be done&quot; roganThanks for this. It proves that we should not vote for this communist. He can rot in Vermont for all I care.Andrew yang was on too!! I would vote for Andrew before this retard.   We already heard his shit 4 years ago nothing new. Raise tax and free healthcare what else??  If you are making 15K a year and between 18 to 25 years old this is your grandpa. And all the grandpa”s out there are voting for Trump.Couldn&#39;t watch more then five minutes of this. I guess Joe likes Bernie.Only 1 hour? You know it&#39;s a shit talk.Wow Tulsi and now Bernie. Great job Joe! Im not a supporter of Democrats myself but Tulsi has caught my attention. And I have to say that your platform is THE PLACE to watch candidates and hear what they have to say without filters and controlled settings by mainstream media and leftist media like Vice, NowTHIS, and the other biased channels.All wages are shit. It&#39;s because the dollar is 98% inflated. <br /><br />Most Americans don&#39;t know what inflation means and that&#39;s done on purpose. Most Millenials are completely clueless to our financial system, and that&#39;s also not their fault, it&#39;s by design. <br /><br />Our money, the US dollar, is called &quot;fiat&quot;. Fiat is a debt based money system. Put simply, when you look at a dollar bill, regardless of amount, it says above the portrait &quot;FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE&quot;. A &quot;Note&quot; is a document of debt. In the 1970&#39;s, Nixon took us off the Gold standard and put us on the fiat Petro-Dollar system. The logic was to create more money through borrowing from the central bank. It&#39;s like having a credit card that the bank says you don&#39;t have to pay back in a timely manner... the problem is that the bank adds interest on the loan our government borrows and this reduces the power and value of the dollar. <br /><br />This may be very confusing, but basically put, our entire financial system is a scam. Our money is worthless because there is nothing backing it. In 1960, minimum wage was 5 quarters made of 90% silver. In today&#39;s value that&#39;s around $26 an hour. Today our coins are made of cheap worthless metals and our paper money is a glorified I.O.U note of debt. Prior to Nixon, you could take a dollar to a bank and exchange it for physical gold. A dollar by definition is a weight in gold. It is a word for the measurement of gold. Today, you can only use a dollar for barter and payment of debts. You cannot go to a bank and exchange the dollar for physical gold. <br /><br />So because our dollar is now a note of debt, the actual value of it is worthless. Thats why our grandparents and great grandparents could buy a hot dog and soda for 5 cents and today you are almost spending $10. And each year the national debt gets higher causing higher dollar inflation, and this causes prices to raise... <br /><br />So unfortunately raising minimum wage will not help. It is the equivalent of giving a heroin addict more and more heroin to help ease the pain of withdrawals. It&#39;s a never ending downward spiral. If the minimum wage is raised, then what will coincide by default is higher cost of living and higher cost of purchasing of items. <br /><br />The only way out of this problem is to get rid of the central banking system, and that most likely isn&#39;t going to happen. What most likely will happen is our debt will get to high and we will have a dollar collapse. This has happened many times in history before and it happened exactly how it is right now i.e. too much debt, too little consumption of goods, loss of faith in the currency. When that happens we go into what&#39;s called hyperinflation. For examples of hyperinflation look up Weimar Germany, Yugoslavia, and any third world nation where they have paper money that say 10,000,000 or more. When hyperinflation occurs, $10,000,000 will have the purchasing power of maybe $20... in other words you can fill your gas tank in your car because the money would be so worthlessSo Bernie picked up a teenage hooker the night before? Talked to a young person who need money desperately.  Sure lolBernie didnt mention nuclear power at all? Dead giveaway that he isn&#39;t serious about climate change.Trump next Joe. ...There’s nothing that this man doesn’t want the government involved in.I found Andrew yang a nice candidate i was all for ben Carson but the dnc always has its “favorite” candidateClimate change is real. Man made climate change is fake.two shillsAll you do when you take that shit away is keep honest people honest. If somebody wants a gun they will get it. Open your fuckin eyesThe main gripe I have is that basically every medical advancement comes from the US.  The reason for that is because finding treatments and cures is insanely profitable, so there&#39;s incentive to do so.  I fear that taking that away would stagnate advancements in our medical system.  All those countries Bernie mentions wait until someone in the US figures something out, then just follows suit.  I&#39;d really like to hear him respond to that question.  That&#39;s my main concern with moving to a single-payer healthcare system.  I have other ones as well, but that&#39;s my main one.Let the thumbs down begin... Aardvark!The JRE has changed the way that media is consumed in the US and probably around the world.  The fucking Fear Factor guy has legitimately changed the way we live day to day.  Love you Joe!Bernie Sanders 2020 president.Joe, invite all the candidates to an actual debate, hosted by you. Let&#39;s make the clown show obsolete.I’m pretty sure he managed to bring up health care in every conversation topic. Politicians are so frustrating and all seem to deflect on anything that strays from their prepared material.Feel the Bern...What I love about Sanders, is that he understands that being President isn&#39;t about just doing everything yourself. It&#39;s about having a vision and picking the right people to help you complete that vision. That is what a true leader does.He speaks in a mild tone to come across as reasonable but if you&#39;re listening to what he&#39;s saying there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s never backed up with anything and a lot of flawed concepts which Joe definitely let him off easy on.<br /><br /><br />While Joe is great I don&#39;t think he&#39;s qualified (as was his interview with Jack Dorsey) to really put politician&#39;s feet to the fire“Hey Bern, you ever try DMT?”Bernie looks deadThis is why I love Rogan; Such a wide variety of guests(Even though being a huge UFC fan, the MMA shows are still my favorite guests. And since he started the separate MMA podcasts, you usually get one of those a week now)!!OHHH MY GAWWD BERNIE!!! ...It&#39;s pathetic how much Liberals love this guys idiotic plans for America. Joe an Bernie how  lameHOLY SHIT NO FUCKING WAYDUDE I can&#39;t believe Bernie smoked a joint with Rogan!You know what I take away from this...radical leftist are retarted weak ass idiots. When Joe has on a right wing guest they scream and cry and demand for people to lose their livelyhood. But Joe has a real liberal all the conservatives are happy and want to hear more honest discussion 🤔I&#39;m conservative and I agree with him about marijuana and green energy.I think you should personally try to take my guns! Fuck you Bernie you commie fuck!Bernie/Trump 2020!Thank you Joe!Don&#39;t let them take your guns Americans!I&#39;m voting for this guy!!!!Ehh lost me at shouldn&#39;t be selling assault rifles..I don&#39;t even own one but the people that do legally own them are not the problem. We are still safer now than any other time in history and beyond that i know how to keep myself out of situations where it could be unsafe, I stay away from schools, politicians, and nite clubs.What about security? Can I have free guns too?Bernie 2020How do I click “like” for the fact that Joe is getting such a diverse and interesting list of people on his show but not seem like I’m showing support for Bernie lol??Let’s put Bernie or Tulsi As Trump’s Vice President and see how the whole country would enjoy the compromiseJoe, a right is not something that the government gives us. A right is something that the  government should not be able to take away. Think about these categories: 1) The right to self expression. 2) The right to self protection. 3) The right to privacy. 4) The right to own property. 5) The right to a fair trial, with a jury of your peers. 6) The right not to be searched or have property seized (without probable cause or due process).<br /><br />Now compare any of those to &quot;access to free products and services&quot; (healthcare). There is a fundamental difference between a natural human right and free products and services.Man. Bernie would come off as much more reasonable if he talked like this instead of yelling like an angry old man from a front porch.Bernie &quot;what does it mean&quot; SandersThis guy scares the shit out of meJoe: But have you tried DMT?&quot;marijuana didn&#39;t do anything for you?  well have you tried DMT?&quot;Legalize weed through executive order: You got my vote!BERNIE BERNIE BERNIE2bh I like Bernie but all i can think about is Tulsi....Thats my president!And (often) the vast majority of the individuals living in despair and squalor have made, and continue to make, horrendous choices in the priorities and responsibility department. Both, personal and to their society.<br /><br /><br />That&#39;s one of the elephants in the room that regulation can not correct, and Socialists and the Democratic party refuse to address. <br /><br /><br />You&#39;re a victim! He made some very good points, however his ideology is misguided and a bit disingenuous..I thought if you buy and sell a stock within a single year you pay 30% tax. So if I make $100 gov gets $30 How is that a small tax? Is that what he plans on raising or is it different?The only politician who has consistently fought for working class for the past 40 years. He has more integrity than all republicans and corporate democrats combined!OMFG!!  Even Bernie is going with the 12 year climate hoax???  You climate people are FREAKS!  At around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m00s">24:00</a> mark, he says that the big corporations don&#39;t want to pay for pollution!!  Now tell me about Global Warming again?????  And last Summer, BY FAR, was a LOT hotter than this year!  Geeeeeze his gun control argument is SO contradictary!  99.9% people are responsible, so you have to give up your guns because of the 0.1%??  Listen to what he said again!Low hanging fruit attacking Trump and trigger words of Russia and Racist I haven&#39;t heard one time 60% of the way through this thing and I&#39;m still listening. Take note. Trump 16 voter still here. Talk about ideas and policy not attacking the other guy. Refreshing! Still haven&#39;t swayed me but I&#39;m listening!My guess is most of the dislikes didn’t actually listen to the podcast.&quot;We&#39;re living in a world where we&#39;re shocked every day by horror.&quot;<br /><br /><br />We&#39;ve been living with this horror since we first became conscious of the U.S. military industrial complex. For some, it was 9/11. For others, it was Abu Ghraib. For still others, it was Collateral Murder.<br /><br /><br />Now it&#39;s daily on liveleak.Giving Bernie a listen. Joe is a respectable interviewer the only backdrop I would watch a Socialist Candidate.Great interview. It just solidified my belief that Bernie Sanders would be the absolute  worst decision America could make for President. Socialists are just communist in disguise . My Grandfather and my Father fought against every thing this man TRULY stands for. Here is a fact for you. He didn&#39;t give you the true intentions he has.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23parentingoveraddys">#parentingoveraddys</a>OY VEY COMMUNISM IS YOUR FRIEND GOY !!That was awesome. ❤Never thought of myself as an anyone supporter but Bernie’s insight of a Presidential candidates’ experience is extremely interesting.this idiot got rid of his staff after they wanted a 15 dollar minimum wage something every socialist fight for what a hypocrite loser if you vote for him do us a favor an dont breed.Idk if I have any more teeth after this. Everything he is proposing is exactly the problem and he is just asking for more of it...Bernie does a great job at listening to Joe&#39;s question and then immediately validating the weight and significance of his question and then follow it up with telling Joe what he knows and admitting what he doesn&#39;t know about that topic. He does this the whole interview. It&#39;s rare for a man his age to have wisdom while maintaining an open mind. I still have a lot of homework to do to see who I want in office though.If any candidate believes in man made climate change then they should be written off. <br /><br />Man made climate change is a hoax and if you believe in it you are an imbecile.I live in despair. Heroin gave me my confidence back though. God Bless America.👍Make a point BernieWhy not have the President on Rogan?hes so wrong on guns and the clementBernie &quot;Against my vote&quot; SandersAll comments are positive but why so many dislikes?They wont let you have your weed Joe, because they own your body through Universal Healthcare. It&#39;s not in THEIR interest.How many women did Bernie speak to last night?! Good luck to the old timer, I hope he wins.Trump supporters will give Blow Job to Billionaires and call them Job creators with a full nut in their mouth!! HaaaI feel odd actually saying this with sincerity and not sarcastically (especially on youtube) but, thank you for keeping it classy comments. I wish more of our modern landscape was people having a fair shake and actually being able to listen to someone you may not agree with.Awesome 👏 Joe. Do Tulsi Gabbard next.Except america has the best doctors and treatments in the world so why do people from all areas of the world come here when its “free” in there countries..Finally some intelligent questions and time to answer them. Sanders doesn&#39;t sound so &quot;crazy&quot; as the media portrays him!I’m a Trumpster, but I gotta admit that Bernie is a likable guy.Go home Bernie, you’re delusional with socialist grandeurI told my father about the podcast he&#39;s a loyal trumpet. Anyway he said it was boring and he didn&#39;t listen for too long. So I listened and had the same thoughts but then I had an epiphany. This is how it should be. Not the circus show we&#39;ve been so longly exposed to as if it were a reflection of normalcy. These topics discussed should be operating fluidly in the background not with a red nose and bow tie on the foreground for shits and giggles.Lobbying is legal briberyHoly shit suck Joe&#39;s dick Gary Johnson you shortsighted idiot! lololololNot a Bern supporter but it&#39;s so awesome that he came on the JRE, this is the best platform for this kind of discussion. It&#39;s almost unbelievable that it has come from being sponsered by flesh lights to this.I am willing to bet that most people that watch Joe Rogan won&#39;t even watch this or start, and leave a nasty comment but won&#39;t care to sit through the whole thing. I dare you Trump-supporting folks to let this man speak and hear what he has to say, I haven&#39;t finished this yet myself but I will. I&#39;ve also listened to Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson, all of them make me completely uncomfortable in their rhetoric but I gave them the whole episode to persuade me and they always come off as standoffish and very close-minded. Are you?I’m all the way right wing and this conversation didn’t change that but it is really sort of encouraging to hear how truly utopian this old slouchy cunt is. To have that level of faith in the DMV to rebuild the country is so beautifully optimistic in much the same way my 5 year old is. God bless bernie. His head is connected to his 4th rib.I really wish there was a Joe Rogan and Stan Lee episodeOther countries this.. and that...Bernie Sanders is a true leader, he inspires hopes in millions of people and he would not only do great things for this country but for the entire world.Have Richard Spencer on already. If nothing else, host a debate between him and Ben Shapiro.Everything that i thought about him is completely true and i can honestly say hes looking in the right places but in the wrong ways, its kind of sadI&#39;m a right leaning guy but i understand a lot of what hes saying , health care and college does sound good BUT he lost me with gun control . Hes speaking about how corrupt our political system is , if everything is so corrupt that seems like a good reason to have an  &quot;AR&quot;.don&#39;t sleep on the fact that mr.krabs sold spongebob&#39;s soul for 67 centsPREACH BERNIE!<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-MP6pXzuc&amp;t=">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-MP6pXzuc&amp;t=</a>BERNIE IS A CUNT.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=36m17s">36:17</a> you lost me right there bernie4.5 billion dollars spent by drug companies in blackmailing politicians. Every American should be aware of this.can we get Donald Trump on JRE next? I know im not the only one that thinks that would be crazy.College debt is not a disease,  you don&#39;t catch it without your own voluntary action.  You know what it costs going in. When you buy a car you know what you owe.  If you can&#39;t afford indoctrination,  don&#39;t go to college.This guy has done zero as a senator in 30+ years. Now he wants the white house 😂THE MAD MAN DID IT. HALLELUJAHJoe: What do you say to the law abiding gun owners that are scared of your talk of banning &quot;assault weapons&quot;?<br /><br />Bernie: They can go fuck themselvesI like Bernie to some extent but he&#39;s just parroting misinformation when they talk about guns and mass shootings. It would not be legal to flip 12 guns in a private sale, duh. The gun show loophole is dramatically misrepresented, every gun show I&#39;ve been to required vendors to have a FFL and an FFL can NOT sell a firearm without perform a background check. Also the &quot;hundreds of mass shootings this year&quot; line is disingenuous at best, as is the &quot;we&#39;re #1 in mass shootings&quot; bit. <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/08/30/america-doesnt-actually-lead-the-world-in-mass-shootings/">https://nypost.com/2018/08/30/america-doesnt-actually-lead-the-world-in-mass-shootings/</a>To everyone using words such as socialism and communism in regards to Bernie: this is the same as stating Trump is a nazi.<br /><br /><br />Please learn a word before you use it, it makes you look really stupid otherwise. Extremely stupid, especially when you state it with such certainty.<br />Then again, US education regarding these terms is fucked cuz of your media and Cold War history and whatnot.<br />But I actually live in Bulgaria that used to be communist. I know what the words mean and what they actually entail in terms of policies. It&#39;s laughable how many US citizens use it. It&#39;s. Laughable.<br /><br /><br />You can research communism online, however I would suspect you might get biased results based on your search history and location so maybe use DuckDuckGo or in case you are too lazy  for that I could write a small wall of text entailing the bulk of what communism was in terms of policies and what defines it as such and separate it from social-democracy. Then again, I&#39;m not a fan of using simple words like communism or libertarianism since the differences between stalinism, maoism, anarcho-libertarianism n so forth are quite apparent and vast. Policies are what really matters in the end, not confusing broad words such as left, right, socialism and such.Listen to this list of problems now vote me in.  that’s all this dudes got second run same as the first.Bernie spent his honeymoon in the USSR  LOL   How many people do you know have done this????Fuck you, you commie fuck!!Joe Rogan is consummate interviewer, he is always asking his guest to expound on their thoughts not letting comments turn into sound bites.Holy fuck amazingJoe Rogan is a fantastic interviewer. His education is well rounded enough that he can ask pointed questions in various areas of debate. I feel he is doing a great service to the world by having these discussions.@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=28m32s">28:32</a> $300,000 in  debt. that was here choice...why should i pay for the debt being forgiven.I don’t doubt Bernie’s sincerity, but he’s also economically illiterate, not that Republicans are any better. He speaks in nothing but platitudes that are easily debunked under even minor scrutiny. None of his proposals can be “free” and paid for at the same time. All the countries he touts as models have significantly higher taxes across the board, not just on the rich both in income taxes and especially in Europe VAT (national sales taxes) as well.As a layman, you don&#39;t often encounter coherent ideologies in todays age.... It&#39;s so compelling to see this (but also somewhat terrifying)Good interview, takes me back to 2015/16 when I really liked Bernie. He&#39;s kind of a rerun candidate now after losing his chance in 2016 and then selling out to Clinton. I wish Joe had asked him about that.Bernie has no idea what he&#39;s talking about. &quot;College used to be virtually free&quot; oh, back when the government wasn&#39;t giving out student loans, maybe we should go back to that then.Why is   Bernie&#39;s head  sinking into his <a href="http://body.is/">body.is</a> He a turtle alien like the snake  alien Alex Jones talks about.How do you know how many guns are in the country??????Come on how can you not like this guy?<br /> big corporations own the government and are using you to stay in power but give nothing in return, meanwhile they keep getting richer even thru recession.God I fucking love hearing politicians just talking about their points rather than fighting over a stage. Doesn&#39;t matter what their stance is, just wanna hear em outGod I hate that ! Not everyone is online, especially older Americans and the poor.1: will this beat out the Alex Jones video?<br />2: Bernie gonna smoke it up?<br /><br /><br />maybe and probably notTRUMP 2020!Great Interview Joe.This was a good conversationShould get somebody like Austin Peterson Or Rand Paul onHoly fucking shit man the mellow man got Bernie mother fucking SandersHow you gonna tell me Joe ain&#39;t a reptile nowLolWe elected a wannabe populist in 2016. Let’s elect the real thing in 2020.1941 the year America went to war with china lol im dyingI recently visited Canada. My friend confirmed that he pays zero out of pocket for medical (except for payroll tax withholding). But he waited ONE YEAR for an MRI that was deemed non emergency.  Good thing it truly was - otherwise cancer could have grown for  year before he got the MRI scan.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BERNIE2020">#BERNIE2020</a>I wish he brought a joint out like he did with ElonThe guy Joe mentions who started hunting down cartel illegal grow operations on public/federal land was just on the Meateater podcastI&#39;m just here to see if they smoke pot together....its sad how things are running. no matter whose &quot;in charge&quot; , if you wanna even call it that, the united states should be running smooth. instread its just a cluster fuck cespoolI&#39;m not a fan of the Berns but I do agree with him on these shady pharmaceutical companies, he might be the best democratic candidate other than Tulsi and Yang&quot;My friend Beto O&#39;Rourke&quot;<br /><br />Jesus christ guy....feel the bern bishesWana know what makes people have mental health I&#39;ll tell you mean growing up in government facilities boys Homes and being beat and beat by grown men everyday and the law doing nothing about you know how many child predators I know that work in child services and group homes many I know and have seen alot people wouldn&#39;t believe and it all happened to me and when your 18 they throw u out in the world after all that pain and abuse and you cant hep but feel envy and wanting to do something about it I battle everyday trying to figure how to take the mfs downnot one mention of war. what are we even doing here?I hope the other republican candidate gets to show too. Nobody knows much about him. I don&#39;t even remember his name.Craaazzy Bernie! (Mic drop sound effect)I disagree with Bernie on a lot of stuff, but a healthy discourse is great for this country which really needs it.Larry King shoulders 🎤Why waste your time with this but when you know he don&#39;t stand a chanceWhile it&#39;s nice and all to give the politicians a platform, it should be in more of a debate form. Not the circus kind of debate you see on tv, but you know, get 2 candidates on there each time, preferrably as opposite as you can (even if it&#39;s restricted to the party, since the talk of the moment is the democrats primaries).<br /><br />I mean, he says whatever the fuck he wants and the only opposition here is w/e joe knows about the subject/his common sense, and not stuff people who are actively going against him know.<br /><br />For instance<br />bernie says &quot;you can buy the same drug in canada cheaper&quot;. Then he attributes that to &quot;single payer healthcare system&quot;<br />Is it? We don&#39;t know.<br /><br />I am brazillian and here you can get drugs super cheap. We also have &quot;medicare for all&quot; (it sucks balls btw). But is that the reason the drugs are cheap? No! It&#39;s because the Govt says Fuck You to patents in medication cases (which i approve tbh). So it&#39;s not a matter of &quot;buying in bulk&quot;, or &quot;single payer&quot;, but of good old market competition.<br /><br />And although I do think patents suck balls and shouldnt exist, their alledged reason for existing is at least somewhat valid: they do increase the gains in case of a specific breakthrough. So while I&#39;m not entirely convinced they do more good than harm, the truth remains that americans are financing pharmaceutical research in a much bigger way than we are. In this way we are benefitting from getting cheap drugs based on research banked by your expensive drugs. <br /><br />IF canada is the same as Brazil, then it would actually suffer a lot if the US tried to do the same as well. In other words, you guys are being leeched and that old dude is telling you to become a leech too, which might not fkn work since there wont be anyone to be leeched left.THE MEATEAH&gt;open YouTube<br />&gt;JRE Bernie Sanders<br />&gt;full erectionThe number of people that are still willing to support comrade Bernie is truly terrifying.this senile old bags voice is atrocious. I hope he chokes to death on a peanut in front of his familyThis was awesome !! I’ve been listening in some form since 2011 when I was delivering pizza. I used to laugh so hard while driving around dropping off pizzas. I would have never expected this. Amazing.The comments on Canadian healthcare are HUGELY oversimplified and Inaccurate. Its not what everyone thinks it is.University of California Tuition: In-state $13,509, Out-of-state $40,191 per yearBut Bernie... Are there aliens? That was too much hahahaReality Tv show? Yang mentioned that the last debate. Bernie mentioned about Amazon not paying anything In Taxes... something Andrew Yang has been advocating for. InterestingPlot twist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m51s">0:51</a> Secret service pounces on Joe, confiscates all of his elk meat, gives his sauna to a local YMCA, seizes all of his muscle cars, strangers now have to live in his homes = Welcome to socialismWas kind of hoping that he&#39;d pull an Elon Musk and smoke a joint with JoeLove you Bernie man, don&#39;t pay attention to any idiots in the comments, Rogan has a right-leaning audience, you&#39;ll never win those fools over. We love you!All those dislikes give me pause about the sincerity of people who claim to be in favor of the &quot;open marketplace of ideas&quot;Joe is the white, male, Italian Oprah!!!!When Joe asked Bernie about gun control: &quot;I wish I had a magical answer, but I don&#39;t.&quot; Andrew Yang does. Guarantee $1000/month income to all Americans. All of our collective stress will be greatly reduced, mental health will improve throughout our society, and fewer violent crimes will be committed.Loved hearing this type of interview with a candidate. Wish it could have gone two more hours and I hope JRE has more candidates on in the future for this type of interview.When joe said: “it seems like we would be able to afford the things you’re talking about if multi billion dollar corporations paid their fair share in taxes...”<br /><br />My tiny liberal dick shot an oyster through my jeans.The whole thing is like people are poor so we need socialism.Bernie is awsome and would do this country good its just a shame they will never let this man get chance too to much profit on how we live rn smhA bunch of Bernie fags will come out of the woodwork now.The year is 2021, and President Bernie Sanders visits for episode 1540 and announces that we have alien technology.  Thank you for all you do, Joe.  The ride may JUST be beginning, friends.Now have on Ted cruz please.Joe. Taking it to the next level. Always!!!Good now bring Mark Levin onto the stage at the same time. Finally heal this country.I got a ad from a pharmaceutical company for This video 😐😐How f!@#$ pathetic. Here comes all the fake commentsThat Vermont Accent though! LolI will proudly vote for this man. Excellent interview.Good get100,000,000 eligible voters didn&#39;t cast a ballot in the 2016 presidential election. According to polls of non-voters, the overwhelming majority are supportive of the type of policies Bernie Sanders advocates--ones that threaten the interests of the exploiters and despoilers that own the American economy and political system. Only Sanders has the platform and strategic acumen to massively expand the electorate and smash Trump.I&#39;m not a Bernie fan at all, but it&#39;s nice seeing him talk calmly here instead of the crazy old coot he is normally portrayed as when the interviews are more focused on getting soundbites.Get that man a cough drop and a waterYou got THE Bernie Sanders to be on your show. The Great St Bernard Sanders! My jaw dropped with excitement!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m42s">0:42</a> Americer&quot;We know how to pay for it&quot;... Never explains how it will be paid for.Bernie”redistribute the wealth” SandersJoe, &quot;Ban assault weapons, but not to military ...&quot;  Bernie, &quot;Right of course&quot;  lol  No regular people need assault weapons and these guys get it.How about just stop leading the world... and focus on problems in your own backyard. It’s the US leadership that is disastrous for the countries around the world.Listen to this idiot talking about Canadian vs American healthcare. I mean I&#39;m no genius, but I took ten seconds to look up both populations and we have about 300 million more people than Canada. Saying they pay half of what we do per year is actually REALLY BAD LOL. GTFOH270 mass shootings?????? lolololol whatTruly, a great interview. I can see Bernie&#39;s appeal.All of these rights Bernie is talking about (15th and 19th) were all passed by the Republicans.  As much as people hate to admit it, the Republicans are more for civil rights than the democrats.We shouldn’t strap the undeveloped 18 year old brain with the decision of school loans, but we’ll let them vote for the leader of the free world. This interview was laughable at best. Joe tossed him softballs. All I heard was free this and free that. Unfortunately there are skulls full of mush on campuses nationwide buying in to all of this bullshit. NOTHING IS FREE people! Someone has to foot the bill, and it won’t be the millionaires,like Bernie himself, doing it. Open a history book, Socialism doesn’t work.If you make less than 200,000 a year and don’t support this man then idk what you’re thinking. This is a working mans president trying to fuck up the super rich. If you think any other candidate has ur back as much as this guy you’re wrong. He wants to bring balance to the force.Great move Bernie! So glad he came on, accept nothing less than greatness guys. Dont accept things cant be done either, manufactured lies to keep you all poor, all is possible!Most Americans have a brain and will never vote in a socialist dirt bag like Bernie, Trump will win again in 2020  fuck you bernieYEESSSSSSS BERNIEEEEEEEEE &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3Glad to see JRE host BernieEnough with the free Medicare in Canada.  It’s a lie 100%. 4 hour line to get a prescription for anything . Corruption left and right.  You need to know people to get anything serious.  If not. What politicians do here ?  Go to private ....   I can’t believe this stupid lie keeps being mentioned.   Canada is NOT a good example of free healthcare.   Maybe Sweden yes .They say 12 years for fossil fuels but every time those year passes it gets upped. Also doesn&#39;t he support 15 a hour wage but it came out he doesn&#39;t pay his staff that.Is this real life?Very good podcast, very interesting, been waiting for this for a long time! He is misinformed about the topic of guns though.I love you Joe, and I love Bernie. May not agree with everything, but I love his enthusiasm, passion, and his apparent care for America <br /><br />I love long format and I hope this is the future and/or the continued future. Or at least has a solid place in information (and even entertainment) consumption <br /><br />For it is the nuance and the tedious details of ideas and conversation that really matters and is actually substantialYou don&#39;t have to press dislike only because you don&#39;t agree, you should dislike what you hate. And if you really hate an old man talking to a bald man there&#39;s something wrong with youThey should&#39;ve gave Bernie some hot tea for his dry throat.Joe Rogan is arguably responsible for the rise in stand-up comedy &amp; certainly podcasts over the last 10 years. He wasn&#39;t the first but he sure was first to show what the true potential of this medium was for comedians. Every one of his friends that made regular appearances in the first couple years are now full-blown headliners, have network specials, huge podcasts... the one common factor is Joe. Stock markets have fluctuated in response to the behavior of guess live on air... It&#39;ll be interesting to see what happens with presidential candidates appearing during election season. The Joe Rogan effect is real.If you can get 2 of the candidates on at same time that be awesomeThe issue with Bernie&#39;s idea of expanding healthcare is simply a mathematical equation. <br /><br />$22 Trillion debt / 329,328,725 (population) = $66,803 per person... <br /><br />You can&#39;t expand anything with each person already owing 67 thousand (rounded).<br />His idea will bankrupt the US. Then you add in cancelling student debt of...  $1.5 Trillion.<br /><br /><br /><br />Minimum wage increases will kill businesses, better yet employers will automate low skilled entry level jobs. Ergo destroy jobs. <br /><br /><br /><br />Okay, health insurance. Get it, if you choose not to have insurance your loss. If you cannot afford insurance either go without luxuries to afford it or search for a higher paying job. <br /><br /><br /><br />Bernie want&#39;s to raise tax on the &quot;1 percent&quot; they will just leave the country, not much of a solution there. They also pay 90% of total tax already. 90% TOTAL. How much more? <br /><br /><br /><br />Gun control, to buy a gun ANYWHERE in the US... YOU NEED TO HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK, or the seller will lose their license. He needs to define his wording of &quot;assault weapons&quot;. <br /><br />The importance of gun ownership is to protect oneself from a tyrannical threat both from overseas and domestically, that and to ensure upkeep of fundamental rights. <br /><br />The 2nd ensures the 1st amendment. Yet the 1st is ranked (in any scale) over the 2nd. Just think about that. <br /><br />Just as an added bonus you&#39;d see a massive increase of stabbings. <br /><br /><br /><br />Incarceration, if you don&#39;t want to go to prison don&#39;t commit crimes. Yes it&#39;s really that simple. <br /><br />Want to make a case for disproportionate incarceration? Change the culture of the community, finish school, don&#39;t have kids out of marriage, stay with the woman/man. The issue is NOT cops going into (typically black/minority communities) and arresting people at random, it is the culture both within the family structure AND the community at large. As an example, pull a Joe Rogan - Marry that woman for the sake of your children.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Re-build rural areas&quot; What, with huge losses to companies with a mandatory wage increase? Really? You&#39;d need to subsidize tax for said companies/areas. To expand on that problem, the first issue I raised. <br /><br /><br /><br />Climate change, tell that to 3rd world countries that NEED fossil fuels to survive. Want to assist them advance? 1st point I made. <br /><br /><br /><br />Poverty, can be best summed up from the world bank &quot;Over the last 25 years, more than a billion people have lifted themselves out of extreme poverty, and the global poverty rate is now lower than it has ever been in recorded history. This is one of the greatest human achievements of our time,&quot; - World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim <br /><br />That&#39;s 1/7th of the worlds population. Unfortunately yes, poverty rates change slowly (so it seems), however this change has occurred rapidly in context to the last 100 years. <br /><br /><br /><br />All in all candidate Bernie is a dreamer.Now have Trump on, please.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m41s">1:04:41</a> war with China ?He&#39;s got a lot of good ideas for sure, but I wish he&#39;d have loosened up and had more of a conversation.  This was a 1hr campaign pitch with specific talking points.I got my wish of having joe speak to a commie SJW....... let&#39;s see how bad he fucks this up.Agree or disagree with his policies, I think he&#39;s a decent dude trying to make a difference for the American people. I&#39;d seriously consider voting for him.Joe Rogan - thank you for being alive!I would have liked a bit more pushback on some things. Not a Bernie fan, but I think it does him a disservice. Then again, Joe isn&#39;t required to do so, he can have any discussion he pleases. Good luck Bernie, I&#39;m a Yang supporter btw. :)Good job JoeBurnt out Bernie lmaoBernie lost almost everyone when he endorsed Hitlerry. Even when the DNC through him under. He just took the money and ran. To make it worse, he doesn&#39;t understand simple economics. Nothing is free, getting taxed 70% you&#39;ll only keep $30 for every $100. Now put that together with higher cost of living, food, fuel, etc. NOTHING IS FREE!!!i have to say: mr sanders makes some appealing arguments. i like that he has no billionaire donorsHe reminds me of Nixon. And he is saying absolutely nothing. But then he&#39;s lying to you. When&#39;s he going to start legislating. No, no no I can&#39;t take it any longer, I gotta go.&quot;Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.&quot; Ben Franklin<br /><br />You wont even get much in the way of temporary safety anyway.Bernie your economic policies are proven to fail. They are dangerous for the freedom of this republic. You do not have my vote.OH I SEE ALL THE COMMENTS. <br />It’s great to see and hear him speak uninterrupted... NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE <br />SILVER TONGUE SERPENT MEANSThings I learned from this:<br />1) Joe negates the need for a limited debate window<br />2) Bernie can spend over an hour and say nothing original.Bernie, why is tuition so high. Answer: federally subsidized student loans. Colleges can raise tuition every year because students  can take out larger and larger students loans. why is the student so high. people that shouldn&#39;t go to college getting loans, poor school choice, using loans for all living expenses.What a get.People have to stop believe one single OLD person will change their countries and their lives. IT&#39;S THEMSELVES WHO WILL CHANGE THINGS. The president is a puppet just like us. It&#39;s a change of consciousness that we  need. About work, education, and culture in general. What are on this beautiful planet for? Most people are low IQ walking zombies. It&#39;s a cycle that is fed by the government and will never change until a real mass change of minds happen. This is what the internet was made for. A mass change of consciousness. It&#39;s up to us not to let the internet be sabotaged. In this time and age, WE NEED EDUCATION ABOVE ALL. We can have machines today to do most heavy work, to free people from nasty jobs that makes miserable the lives of many. OR at least pay more for shitty jobs. The most tiresome and depressing jobs are the ones paid LESS. This is beyond forgiving. No human being should spend their precious time working on shitty jobs.Go BernieStresses climate change is real.. makes a case for global warming lol get your false accusations in order. Nobody has truly felt a minuet difference in climate since you shitbricks started with this angle so how are we supposed too believe in 12 years theirs no turning back. The sad thing is if this stupid argument was true our best bet would most likely be too stop burning fossil fuels publicly so that nasa can get us on mars with mission after mission like the old daysI&#39;m far from a Bernie Sanders supporter but he should have ran against Trump not Hillary. He was robbed then the people who helped Hillary rob him confessed and one even wrote a book but nobody went to prison! Bernie is the last thing this country needs but he&#39;s a legitimate voice with real ideas that he expresses extremely well. The fact that the DNC didn&#39;t throw everything they had behind him proves just how contrary their agenda is to the Democrat voter. I&#39;m disgusted with the state of American politics as are most but Bernie is not the guy. Bernie should have gone out swinging when he found out they were stealing the nomination from him because the victims included everyone who donated money to him, all who supported him on social media and all who believed in him. The fact that he let it slide and drove away in his 100k sports car to the second house he purchased soon after the loss made him look far less like the man of the people he conned people into believing he was.Trump is the next one on11 minutes 30 seconds for the broken record to skip<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=20m20s">20:20</a> Starts yelling...10,000 people are partisan HACKS.Fuck this old annoying JewJoe more of this!!! Im open to hearing conservative candidates as well.How the American people have not put this guy into power already blows my freakin mind. Trump is an evil moron, everything Bernie says makes perfect sense and somehow Trump is calling the shots.fuck this old white man shit fuck every political person.Bernie doesn’t understand that raising minimum wage is just a never ending cycle. Every part of cost of living will go up and nullify any raise in wage.These podcasts are truly revolutionary. Free, unedited, long-form intelligent discussion is the future; no more sound bites. Fuck the MSM.We need uninterrupted long form just like this. Not Sound bites. It&#39;s friggin stupid.I cant wait til Donald Trump is on JRE next weekScum.Bernie is a communist disguised as a socialist piece of shit. You fucktards haven&#39;t heard much more other than this interview. Nor do most of you know his voting track record as you haven&#39;t bothered to research a fucking thing outside of watching/listening to what the controlled media tells you. Most of you are suffering from arrested development and social engineering. You&#39;re so fucking brainwashed and/or stupid that reading this will only cause you to type some childish response. Bernie is a traitor to our Republic. Any politician that refers to the United States as a democracy is either too stupid to be in political office and/or a traitor by default. Period.If Andrew yang can&#39;t pull it off this guy can be my secondInterview Jared Taylor!What&#39;re the chances he gets Trump to come on?Now three of my top 3 democratic candidates have all been on JRE. Andrew yang, bernie and tulsi. WowwI&#39;m not a fan of either party. I do think we should have a similar healthcare system to Canada. Somehow they make it work there and the income tax rates are on par with ours.I gotta hand it to Joe. He is an equal opportunity interviewer. He might just be the next Larry King.Hey im a human and i liked this!Trump. Gotta have him. After 3 democrats this year.<br />So coolbthe ufc guy the dude from news radio having the the most important discussions with some of the most influential people politically. Let alone every thing else you talk bout. <br />Positive lifeAs someone who voted for trump,  and looks like I might do it again.  It was nice to hear out Bernie. I still can&#39;t bring myself to vote for the guy. I would love to see a 3 person podcast with joe, crowder, and Bernie.It’s refreshing how authentic this conversation/interview was. JRE should be the new political format. Come on here and lay out your ideas. Great job, Joe.If he could he should bring on every candidate willing to speak uninterrupted so people get a better picture on who theyre voting forThis is will be the most commented video on this channel.  Aug, 6, 2019 - time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=20m11s">20:11</a> 8:11 PM - 476,052 views / 24,533 Comments. What is it at now? Upvote.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=29m00s">29:00</a> - And when student dept is canceled do I get the money back that I used to pay off mine last year? I was responsible with my money and lucky enough to pay what I owed. Should I not have payed off my student loans for the money I borrowed?Bernie tells you what the corporate elite don’t want you to hear. He fights for the people against profits and crony capitalism. He truly cares for the American people and wants to improve our standard of living. He understands the inequities and corruption in our society and wants to fix it with common sense populist policies. They will fight him every step of the way because he’s one of the few people that will fundamentally change the system to be for the people. 🇺🇸Regardless of who you support but we can agree that this type of forum uninterrupted helps you to know the candidate more than the antics. I mean, am yet to see a two hour Biden video explaining his ideas...we need more of thisShit I could have listened for a 3hr podcast. <br /><br />Who wouldn&#39;t support his platform? I didn&#39;t hear a single radical thing.. <br /><br />I wish the USA was smart enough to elect BernieThis is what i love about Joe Rogan. He gives everyone a platform, regardless of their politics. I&#39;m by no means a fan of Bernie, but i see the value of what Joe seems to be doing. We need to close this political divide, and we need more people like Joe doing this if we&#39;ve got a chance of establishing common ground.Joe &quot;I think if you smoke weed and take DMT you&#39;ll look at that issue differently&quot; Rogan.<br /><br />Great discussion btw . . Well worth a watch .Welcome to the new media. <br />All in praise of the free form of this interview, I agree. However to think that these platforms (YT,FB,IG etc) do not have leanings and levels of algorithmically supported “nudges” of political perspective for what the smart owners “know” are best is not only a joke, but dangerous. Welcome to the age of instantly accessible manipulation in which the weight of words can carry on their power as the past has shown for nearly all politics, with those true to the people mysteriously dying or being assassinated, and those who sell lies continuing on. Of course Sanders echoes what you all have been saying in your heads through his points, he needs your votes hence sitting in that chair across from a new outlet you’ve now come to trust on what feels as a personal level. All this on a platform that garners great value from your eyes and attention. Read (or listen) to more books on histories ups and downs to understand how and why socialism will fail, as well as read why our nation is failing now from the one sidededness of government in bed with Ultra big business while true American wealth for the common man declines. Neither side is right, only freedom in speech and liberty is. Be ready for the upcoming ride America no matter who, because justblike the economic machine, our nation is driven by money, and the manipulation money has seen in the last 10 years has fed the political beast on all sides.Far more information than cnn&#39;s &quot;15 seconds to cover a major issue&quot; formatJoe Rogan PropagandacastJoe don&#39;t fall for this everybodys rights shit.....they mean flood America with illegals were everything for free and watch it fall equallyGood stuff Bernie!I hope this goes viral.Joe Rogan evolving on breaking down our echo chambers from left and right?  This interview marks the pinnacle of that.  Bravo to both Sanders and Rogan for making this possible for the American public!Joe you never challenged Sanders fake stats and ridiculous assertions particularly on how &quot;easy&quot; implementation of Medicare for all would be. Bad job Joe. Worse than the interview with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Someone there could&#39;ve prepared some hard questions for the purveyor of such an evil ideology (Socialism).If all candidates could undertake long unedited interviews like this, I truly think everyone would benefit and conversations could be much more productive.I wish Joe would host Dr.Thomas Sowell.The most consistent and honest presidential candidate! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23feelthebern">#feelthebern</a>Joe needs to host a debate between Bernie and Yang. Yang is really a more up to date Bernie.Bernie is Americans under dog we need to give him a chance at office he&#39;ll be better than trumpBernie acts all sad about a few mass shooting, yet he is an apologist for an ideology that killed at least 200 million people. We don&#39;t need fucking backround checks, if there is anything in your background that should prohibit you from getting a gun, you should not be free to buy anything in the first place. If you cannot be trusted to carry, you cannot be trusted to be free at all. Keep violent people in prison and keep insane people in asylums. Almost all these shooters were on mind bending drugs, if you need such drugs to be functional, it should be the confines of an asylum.Bernie is good at pointing out the problems, but his solutions are ridiculous.Looks like I’ll have to vote for BernieAs a Libertarian, this is a side of Bernie I&#39;ve never seen before. Thanks so much for providing a platform for people to speak. Get as many other candidates on as possible. I want to hear all their thoughts. Please keep up the amazing work.12 years later, yea we&#39;re still alive.Rogan: so what&#39;s the hurdal? A doctor answers: because this is my business...do I not have a right to my own business?get this man a book on basic economicsCommenting for algorithmNow we need to see Biden on this show. News Flash: He ain&#39;t coming. Can you imagine him answering real questions for an hour. How about Warren, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s ever been on. I don&#39;t think she would come. Bernie 2020!How you were awesome!Why are there so many dislikes?Bernie is for Disclosure. WOOHOO!   I&#39;d ask you all to vote for him but I&#39;m Canadian and I don&#39;t want to influence your vote.  I heard that&#39;s illegal.Healthcare for all and Free higher Education aren&#39;t some special reward for being wealthy or a luxury...they are necessities for civilization to flourish today.This old dirt bag is too interested in getting into everyone else’s pockets. Fuck socialists.Even if Bernies ideology works and can be sustained long term it isn&#39;t going to work in a country that doesn&#39;t have a homogeneous population. With diversity there is no unity, with no unity there is no community and without those things there is no hope for any form of Socialism.WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE!Come Goys and Girls! Come witness the New York Communist Jew who wants to be the President of the United States!Joe Rogan: Fuuuuuuck, that’s wild man. I remember we were smoking DMT laced pcp— mixed with lsd laced cocoa leaves, smoking with a bunch of Chechen warlords and guerillas, blew. My. Mind. You know we hitchhiked with some Belarusian sheep herders after, we had to stay in the back with the sheep, was fucking nuts bro. <br /><br />Bernie: woa, that’s nuts broJoe - 20 Candidates - 20 Hours. Nuff said. Or give them 2 hours each. That&#39;s only 40 <a href="http://hours.one/">hours.One</a> work week. I think it&#39;s your duty.Assault weapon are for mass destruction lmao . What the fuck does that even meanAssualt weapons are fully automatic firearms which are not acquired easily. It&#39;s important to distinguish the difference because legal language and definitions are important.Over $100 trillion to pay for alllll this magic bullshit over a decade&quot;s time (and thats a low estimate) I hope all you open border fucks enjoy the downfall of this society because if this communist clown gets into power its fucking over for EVERYONE in this country. EVERYONE. Socialism doesnt fucking work. Dont piss on our collective heads and tell us its raining, Americans are too smart to fall for this crap, and if you Demi Socialists think doing all this shit is going to fix the fundamental issues in this society than I want whatever youre smoking cuz that must be some good shit. FoH with this old fuck. He has THREE FUCKING MANSIONS, doesnt house any refugees but wants allllll of America to be a wide open Hotel for everyone in the world to come in and do whatever the fuck they want. Fuck this dude. His bullshit ideas have been dis-proven hundreds and hundreds of times and you fools still buy it. Unbelievable.So if he gets elected does he tax the 1%first?? Or close tax loopholes on the 1% first. He wont be able to close tax loopholes with the democrat and republican establishement in Washington. So if he wants a quarter of his ideas then the middle-class losses.i&#39;m guessing Bernie didn&#39;t take a pic with the flamethrower?I&#39;m from the UK. I knew nothing about Bernie Sanders prior to watching this other than people make fun of him for being a &#39;socialist&#39;. All I got from this is that he seems like a person who genuinely cares about fixing the issues that America faces, which is more than I can say for the current US administration. He also doesn&#39;t seem to be ashamed of not knowing the answer to questions which is a rare ability from a politician.Thank you Mr Rogan for 60 minutes of sanity.- Bernie talks about the benefits of Medicare for all, doesn&#39;t bring up the cost (or who will be forced at gunpoint to pay for it)<br />- Bernie talks about the cost of healthcare in Canada, doesn&#39;t bring up the lousy service (2-3 times as long waiting for life saving procedures. Your heart surgery is only free if you live that long)<br />- Bernie talks about the huge REVENUES of drug/insurance companies, but glosses over their insane COSTS and tries to lead the listener to conclude they therefore must be making insane profits. Their profits are large &quot;numbers&quot;, but the margin (the percentage of profit from revenue) is not. Billions in profit is nothing when you have trillions in costs. Yet that&#39;s where the savings is supposed to come from, we&#39;re supposed to pretend that a $6k bill for a broken bone is because of drug company profits. WRONG.<br />- Bernie talks about the high US healthcare bills, but ignores the real reason for it; Your bill is high because you&#39;re paying for the three people in front of you who didn&#39;t pay their bill. That&#39;s socialism, we already have socialism. Our healthcare is broken BECAUSE of socialism, it won&#39;t be saved with more of it, but less.<br />- Bernie gushes over Scandinavian systems, but doesn&#39;t note their 40-50% effective tax rates for normal wage earning citizens, or how their systems only solvent because of US subsidization; The US pays 2-3x the cost for drugs that they do. If the US paid less for drugs, the rest of the world would have to pay more to make up the difference, and if the Scandinavian countries and Britain had to pay more (their fair share), their systems would go bankrupt.<br /><br />------------<br />Socialism in a nutshell: &quot;This sure does sound nice doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />Socialism is what you desperately WANT to be the solution, but it isn&#39;t.<br /><br />Socialism only works when you still have other people&#39;s money to spend, and for now, the rest of the world only gets to socialize their healthcare using US money subsidizing their care.<br /><br /><br />The real fix is simply removing what broke it; the soft-socialism of today. <br /><br />We don&#39;t socialize the grocery store, yet no one goes hungry. But the moment you make it so that someone can load their cart up, not pay, and get a free pass out the door, the cost of bread will rise to $7, and milk $12 as stores seek to recoup their losses on the remaining paying customers. As a result of those rising costs, more and more &quot;can&#39;t pay the high food costs&quot;, which only raises costs even further. A death spiral of rising costs, just like healthcare now. Thanks soft-socialism. (everyone LOVES socialism when it&#39;s someone ELSE paying the bill)<br /><br /><br /><br />We need to end those practices in healthcare as well, and watch costs drop back down to normal as a result. No one will die, and no one will go untreated when we revert back to normal market principles, just like how now one starves today; because when you only have to pay for YOURSELF, nearly all Americans can afford insurance. And when nearly all can, nearly all will, leaving only a few remaining who <i>genuinely</i> can&#39;t, who can again be serviced by small government support programs, as with food.<br /><br /><br />We don&#39;t need the government to do things for us, we need government to get out of the way and quit breaking things that were working fine before. Food isn&#39;t a right, housing isn&#39;t a right, and healthcare isn&#39;t a right. And if one is, they all are, and congratulations now you have communism, which has failed every time it was tried, because you always run out of someone else&#39;s money. And when money runs out, you appropriate labor, by force. Welcome to the gulag comrade.12 years my ass! Lies! Bullshit. If the environment was a decade away from destruction,  YOU WOULD KNOW IT! Not because the media says so, but you would be barely surviving right now.  They&#39;ve been lying about the environment for 30 years.  The ocean was supposed to rise like 50 feet since 1990. Has it? No. Not one inch. Bullshit.He wasn&#39;t even paying his own campaign workers $15.00/hr ffs. <br /><br />Everyone sounds great when they offer gift at the expense of someone else.<br /><br />Corporate profits are taxed twice so even if the corporation doesn&#39;t pay the tax, that money is passed onto the shareholder who pays capital gains. Overall, it might be a lille less tax income the money IS being taxed.I appreciate the long form discussion very much. However, while sincere, Bernie demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of labor value or demand in the minimum wage segment as well as the amazon income tax issue. Amazon isn&#39;t stashing their cash in tax havens, they are reinvesting all of it into infrastructure and growth protocol. Does Bernie believe businesses should have a limit on how much they can be allowed to reinvest into themselves? Does he believe businesses should be tax and gross income instead of net (while forcing them to pay $15.  Joe Rogan does a great job of being so friendly with every guest he has on his show, regardless of their ideology, but I am disappointed that he does not push back on any of these issues when he should certainly know better.Bernie “socialist with our money Capitalist with his” SandersVote for Bernie 🙌<b>Americans are getting FLEECED for healthcare and they will come here and downvote this video. AMAZING.</b>Burn one Bernie!!!Money buys drugs just follow the moneyYou expect me to listen to guy who says &quot; assault weapons&quot; and UBCs and the old favorite &quot;gun show loophole&quot; myth. Its getting tiresome. And its really funny that he mentions only 2 of the shootings. Doesn&#39;t even mention chicago. Its almost as if it&#39;d look bad on his party because they don&#39;t know how to run a damn cityI heard this guy is advocating for a nation wide minimum wage of 15.00 per hour but doesn&#39;t even pay his own staff that amount.Joe thank you for this. A truly well done interview.Can you imagine if Bernie went on Crowder? He would get smoked in an open forum discussion. This is straight softball Joe Fucking Rogan, where you can see he’s just a meathead.., government force, tens of trillions of dollars in healthcare program. Sounds great to him...He actually is sounding really reasonable and pragmatic <br /><br />Very surprising for a politicianLet&#39;s get Trump Next lol 🇺🇲I remember the day minimum wages was raised in our state I was excited cause I was making minimum wage in a pizza joint.  Then I Walked out to the dining area and saw my boss changing all the prices and they weren&#39;t going down.  I remember thinking to my self I can&#39;t afford to eat here anymore.Changing what has worked is WEEEEEETARDED just like bernies fantasies of booCOCKEE life.  Phukk this CUCKLet&#39;s have Trump on next!Sanders NEVER talks about personal responsibility he does make vaid points but the way he fixes things makes no sense.Now if Bernie gets elected and I get a notification for a Bernie episode in 2020 I&#39;m clicking that button so damn fast.Ross Perot was genius.  We would have been better off and further along with Ross Perot in the oval office.Why are we not talking about the industry of private prisons in some states, and the control they have?The fucking Clintons screwed you out of the Presidency, sorry  Bernie ,all the smart people love you and have the utmost respect for you. Now with the whole health care situation im on the fence,  i dont wont too wait a month to see a doctor that specializes in something  when working my ass off every day for health care and too help keep this country strong by paying taxes, and someone that doesn&#39;t pay taxes and or sits on there asses at home ,everyone should have a job and pay taxes other wise there not helping make this country great why keep them going . If your car doesn&#39;t work you get rid of it right?Bernie will never beat Trump not even in a Mandela effected version you socialist cock sucking dirt baggoddamn I forgot how satisfying it is to listen to a politician who is intelligent and respectable.Brilliant Joe! Cheers...No fucking way4 years too late but oh wellat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m40s">34:40</a> it just sounds like bernie let out a huge burp lol. good talk thoThe other Democrats candidate reading the positive comments 👀👀👀 Blowing Joe&#39;s phone up trying to get booked for the next podcast ... 😅😂Holy fuck he’s right. China does have fewer people in prison than the United States. Not per capita, but in total. <br /><br />US: 2.1 million people in prison.<br /><br />China: 1.5 millionIt&#39;s not cause we don&#39;t have enough government. It&#39;s that we leave it to the government to think about. Most people don&#39;t take the time to think about their own lives.This dude talks out his asss. His shoulder above his head 🤡 he talks about specific issues that no one can relate too fohRefreshing interview. 👍Loved it, America this is your last hope before your democracy crumbles into oligarchy. Save your stupid selves. Elect this man.When <b>BERNIE</b> becomes president we will finally have a democracy that works for the people and the greedy corporations will lose money and power. Right now under the neo liberal Dems and psychotic conservatives we have a Corporatocracy, Kelptocracy and Crony Capitalism. That&#39;s why all of the cable news channels besmirch Bernie&#39;s good name and try and propagandize the masses against Sanders.I had a dream that Trump  was on last night.  Holy shitDid Eddie Bravo ask you to ask that last question? lmaoThese podcasts are the begining of the end for cnn and foxnewsBernie president for life.Bernie does not want a format in which he can debate, he wants longer uninterrupted time to tell you what&#39;s whatBernie looks so happyI&#39;m glad he did this podcast but a little push back would be nice. A 4 year old Austrian economist could poke more holes in this interview than a pin cushionI wish he would just answer HOW he is going to do this... you asked him and I appreciate it but its just the same talking points, where is the explanation, the plan, the method, the legislature.Always been a Labeling issue. <br />Social Democrat not Democratic SocialistYes, not a great nation, only a big nation. Is right.Why not cancel college and make high school half of your job education. A lot of what you learn in high school has nothing to do with a career.... Let&#39;s make part of it about taxes job placement and life education. And then for the people who need to go to higher education a 2 year or 6 year (depending on the severity of the trade) Education.Bernie your a clean up cuk! Go shit in ur hand!So good to read all these civil, intelligent comments. Very cool.At no point during his rambling, incoherent statements did I gather any truth. I award you no points.is Bernie Sanders a psychiatrist? How the hell does he know all those people that conveniently tell him what he needs to hear to further his agenda?Hes a marxist communist no matter how much he bull shits his narritive...Bernie is too woke to win 😣I love Bernie, but I absolutely do not agree with his supposed tax on Wall St., How is that fair? This was not dove into enough; especially about how he plans on executing the tax and at wich level of investor would be effected, and for what percent. This shit matters. From the smallest fish to the biggest sharkBackground checks don’t work. Criminals will just buy illegal guns. Guns are easier to get across the boarder than drugsIm a gun loving America and have my share of weapons. Im with you on the background checks and gun show BS that goes on down south, “ i live in Jersey and they go up your ass” But why a ban on any weapons, as long as the people who own them have passed the background checks and have no mental instabilities all weapons should be available. They are tools used for hunting and marksmanship not weapons of mass destruction. There are those of us who love sport shooting and hunting as hobby and way of life, why should we be restricted for the few shit birds in the world that have a few screws lose. And lets not get into shooting fatalities, annually the majority are suicides.Joe “try to keep this sucker right there, yeah that’s it” roganI thought joe rogan runs his ads at the front of his podcasts cause he doesnt like obnoxious ads popping up in the middle??I really think Joe was throwing softballs, especially when he was talking about a gun banThis is awesome Rogan having Bernie on!!! Too bad there&#39;s so many pencil dick pseudo tough guys trying to shit all over it. It&#39;s not &quot;tough&quot; to care about people&#39;s health, or to fight for an all inclusive society where corporations are responsible for their employees, the community they reside and pay fair taxes without loopholes and cheating and lobbying. &quot;Tough&quot; guys work 60 hours a week shoveling rocks for 200 bucks a week and get insurance for another 200 a week and the insurance has a 1000 dollar deductable for well visits while the owner of their company, who inherited it, never worked a minute, and cooked the books so it didn&#39;t show any profit during record profit years, sails the carribean while collecting hundreds of millions off of his workers backs. That&#39;s what real tough guys want for their tough guy lives. LolJust looked at the comments and let me tell ya. W’shidnnt.GET MARIANNE WILLIAMSON ONno Bernard, health care is not a human right. Health care is a service and you have the right to access that service. You cant force someone to work for you.unless there&#39;s weed involved i&#39;m not interested in this podcast.Bernie 2020 baby7.3K people do not want to know about aliens :/Noooooooo way financial transaction tax of half a percent raises 2.4 trillion.How could 8000+ people dislike this video? He is talking about real issues and real solutions that are good for everybody. Not one faction or another but EVERYBODY.Just got an ad for Trantelix lol for depression and anxiety as Bernie and Joe are talking about mental health . Wtf YTBernie, giving people free coverage/ care and not controlling the costs is the most idiotic thing i have ever heard. If you want to control costs and i am unaware of that than i apologize. You know who wants this setup? Hospitals and doctorsAs someone who vehemently disagrees with Bernie Sanders&#39; worldview I think we can all agree that the debate formats are absurd. In this day and age there is no reason we shouldn&#39;t have presidential candidates doing long form interviews like this instead of entertainment spectacles like the current debates that mirror low brow, reality TV style bickering, insults, and soundbites.1941 war with China? 🤣🤣<br /><br />Other than that, great podcast. You go BernieCommunists suck...Welcome joe rogan the the brotherhood of bernardIf it sounds too good to be true it’s bullshitI agree with Bernie on the issues, just not the solutions.PLEASE JOE, KEEP DOING THESE FOR ALL THE CANDIDATESHe seems like a nice guy, but he should probably make less promises. Even one of these issues would take years to fix and cost a large percentage of GDP. Trumps promises were less grandiose and he still hasn’t made big progress on ‘the wall’ due to opposition lawsuits etc. the Democratic Party might need to compromise a little if they ever want to achieve real change.It would be nice to see Donald Trump on the show... that would be the show of all shows..     even maybe Alex Jones as a guest appearance.. and have Eddie Bravo there too.. and both Alex and Eddie can say whatever they want.Trying to reach the young voters Bernie. hahahait wasn&#39;t undone by republicans the assault weapons ban had a sunset clause of 10 years.Anyone with a brain turned this off around 20 minutes in. Bernie&#39;s good points are followed by false answers.Great podcast, except for the part where he didn’t offer any real, feasible, specific solutions to anything that he has proposed. The dude needs to incorporate some actual math into his proposed policies.This is the sort of format that can actually change peoples opinions, Bernie made a very smart move here.G thanks for having him on Joe LOL we are all little more stupid. I award you no pointsIf only Bernie had decided NOT to support Hillary and not state &quot;&quot;When you’re white, you don’t know what it’s like to be living in a ghetto. You don’t know what it’s like to be poor.&quot;, I&#39;d have given him a legitimate consideration.  However, Bernie greatly compromised his morals.  I didn&#39;t like Sanders financial platform but I considered him a morally centered man.  After those two statements, he lost the morally centered, he&#39;s simply a politician that can be bought and paid for.  So Fuck him.Yee doggieOnly watching to see if Bernie smokes a blunt with JoeTaxation is theft.. still tho this is one of the best podcasts Iv seen in a while..Bernie&#39;s solution to every problem in society at every level is more government involvement, including in areas where government is already involved and isn&#39;t very effective. That&#39;s why I like Yang, and find him much more credible - he looks at every problem in its own terms and looks at the details with an open mind. When asked about college education, Yang replied that we need to look into why tuition fees have more than doubled in real terms since 2000. Bernie&#39;s answer: government needs to spend more money. Yang also promised to set out clearly the aims of every policy, and then report back annually on whether those aims have been achieved. <br /><br />I think Bernie is well intentioned, but he&#39;s a one trick pony ideologue who believes the answer to every question is Spend! Spend! Spend! And when the impact is zero or negligible, he will ask to spend more.<br /><br />Another minor point about Bernie is he got himself mixed up several times during this interview (for example, saying that during WW2 America was at war with China, rather than Japan). He&#39;&#39;s showing his age. Imagine what he&#39;s going to be like in four years!Vote for Bernie for president in 2020. Enough bullshit already.Socialist Freak ShowBERNIEEEEEThe next president needs to show we can pay down our debt before we start buying more shit, people tryna buy unicorns with pay day loans and shitBernie’s 6ft tall and somehow joes “5’8” frame towers over him in the thumbnail! Wtf is going on Joe?! Lololol<br />Edit: and don’t give me that “Bernie has terrible posture” bs. Joe’s self conscious about his height. Btw I’m a fan of Brogan.It really doesn’t matter what your politics are, these discussions are so important. He should have more candidatesBernie, you need to come to Canada and see how our health care actually works. We pay for dental, hearing, sight, drug, mental health out of pocket.  Yes it still better than the us but it really is not very good.Awesome interview, was hoping for this because I believe joe always keeps it real. Only thing I wish is he would of brought up the DNC debacle last electionwish bernie gave and answer and didnt dance around the question of illegal production of drugs in america. Joe even tried to come back around and ask the same question twice. Either than that, solid interview. excited to see what mr yang has to say on the h3h3 podcast tomorrow.Not one, “fuck”.Is Sanders really Tony CliftonI wonder how high they got before this like I&#39;m pretty sure they both took like 3 hours of just blazing before this!!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h00m44s">1:00:44</a> &quot;Chiner and Russier&quot; excellent for foreign relations.If Bernie Sanders just started calling himself a Social Democrat.  Instead of Democratic Socialist.  <br />Turrible Labeling.1. You can’t make minimum wage $15 an hour.  You’ll wreck the economy. Gas. Food. Etc will all go up. That’s idiotic. <br />2. You’re not taking my guns away. I’m okay with more invasive and more robust background checks. But you’re not taking my guns away.<b><i>THE MEDIA IS TO BLAME FOR THE NUMBER OF MASS SHOOTINGS BECAUSE THEY GIVE THE SHOOTERS NAME RECOGNITION AND FAME AFTER EVERY SHOOTING</i></b>Bernie is great at pointing out problems however, none of his solutions will work if you analyze them with very basic math and economics.  He has zero awareness of the collateral damage caused by these policies.Me: I think that word ends with an &quot;A&quot; bruh<br />Bernie: No, that word definitely ends in an &quot;R&quot; brur!!!!Jesus Christ, Bernie.  Can you please look at the person you&#39;re speaking to.This is why Bernie will win. He is going out to earn every single vote possible bevause he actually bwlieves what hes saying. Bernie isn&#39;t even President and transformed the Democratic Party more than Obama did in 8 years.hey f...rs how about lower my income taxes, they take a third of  MY MONEY. My money not your money. and stop printing money, no more war for oil reasons.Bernie is a good guy just trying to do the right thing. You can easily get a sense of that. Good episode.BATTLE OF THE SHINY HEADSFuck yaBernie (because I know you&#39;re listening:), I love most of your ideas and support your candidacy, but your so-called &quot;Wall St. speculation tax&quot; will adversely impact many ordinary, middle-class people, like me, who happen to trade stocks. If you implement such a tax you should make sure it exempts people making low- or middle-class incomes. Otherwise you&#39;re just contributing to the economic hardships on working-class people you&#39;ve spent the last 40 years fighting against!Bold move B E R N A R DClimate change is real, but its not caused by humans..I love Bernie....just wish he didn&#39;t take that giant payoff from Hillary to drop out of the race.Great interview. Bernie really brought it.With all due respect bernie, you&#39;re a fucktard. But good on ya for being a fucktard on Joe Rogan.Hope all you Americans (who can vote) vote. I’m not American and I wish I could vote in the the election. Lol I don’t even care for my country’s election that much.Joe you should use your show wisely and promote the Independent party, I think you are owned as well and play a good game.I love how he called out CNN on those commercials! Rogan should host the debates on his show, so people could finish a sentenceGo Bernie! ✊👏🇺🇸THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGH COLLEGE DISCUSSION!!!<br />It&#39;s about time I don&#39;t have to chain myself with thousands in debt, in order to be able to live in the current area I live in, when I move out, and neither should anyone have to file bankruptcy over a hard worked diploma!Listen to Bernie talk about those billionaires! Wooooo he sure sounds envious, doesn&#39;t he? You can hear it clearly.Awesome is all I have to say.  Hindsight 20/20.  lolI think it makes sense to have a higher asset inheritance/ passed down wealth tax on any gains from disposal. I dont like people who inherit power and haven’t earned it. But income tax rates definitely need to be lowered. That is earned wealth, that is not right imo to tax people for the net benefits they EARNED and worked at uneven rates. We should encourage business activities , not discourage.Raise money I mean tax. Hahahah we got enough taxes bro. Look at what’s happening to the states that keep increasing taxes. People leave because it’s too much.Best episode ever. Feel the Bern!Fraiser Institute: average wait time to see doctor in Canada is 26 weeks. Look it up. Canadians come to USA for cancer treatment.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23KAG">#KAG</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JobsNotMobs">#JobsNotMobs</a>Brings up minimum wage and mentions the most mundane argument for it.  How about the efficacy of forcing small business owners to pay more while expecting them to stay open when larger companies can just eat the cost?  It would push small businesses out of the market because they&#39;d be forced to raise prices, while large companies can just wait them out and take their slice of the marketshare.I don’t need an AR-15 to protect myself from criminals. I need it to protect myself from the government and politicians like Bernie Sanders. <br /><br />Joe stops anyone else when they say bullshit but all he did was toss Bernie underhanded pitches and didn’t interrupt and cal bullshit when he knew Bernie was spitting out lies like the gun show loophole.&quot;Cutting back on high frequency trading&quot;<br />Yeah, because everyone know making goods illiquid has a positive impact on price discovery. What a fucking moron.Is Joe Rogan still considered a gateway to the alt-right at this point?Sanders can calmly and slowly say here what he loudly and erratically says on stage, it still doesn&#39;t make it economically viable.  <br />just sayinI&#39;m writing in Bernie in 2020Go off on privatized healthcare kingBernie socialism SandersUh, did no one notice thats Bernie Sanders says America fought China in WW2? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m30s">1:04:30</a>Go go jo! Well done I enjoyed this one ...props to youWait...the U.S. Citizens having more rifles than the military is bad? It&#39;s literally the basis behind the 2nd amendment. To be able to possess and own armory sufficient in the situation the government goes nuts and we have to go 2-0 and give Europe some Vietnam flashbacksCorey Booker blocked Bernies bill to lower drug prices but you will never hear Bernie or democrats criticize Booker.Two things.<br /><br /><br />1. Screw Marxism and all its proponents and followers.<br />2. Thank you, Joe, for interviewing a Marxist and giving him a fair platform to share his views in a public forum.YouTube not letting this video appear on trending 🤦‍♂️this is the smartest move bernie has made. million will watch this instead of that bull shit show debateThe reason we don’t have the Healthcare, is because we have so many fat fucks. We end up suffering more preventable diseases, and we either need to go on Slimfast, or cull the herdBernie - you&#39;ve got my vote!  Keep up the good fight!Not a Bernie fan, center right leaning, but great to hear him actually sit down and have a casual interview, thanks Joe.&quot;yea, they have problems, everyone has problems&quot;  Yea, BUT THOSE ARE SOME BIG ASS PROBLEMS.. he just brushes them off.Great show Joe like a lot of them but this one actually can means something I hate politics and politicians in general but people have to wake up and listen to a man who is sincere and telling the truthMan I wish people would listen to what he is saying.  He is saying the tuition cost is high because we are letting them increase it.  It increased because the government started to subsidize it.This for sure will get lost in the shuffle but damn Joe I never thought you would have Bernie on your show... Thank you sincerely Joe, thank youYOU GOT FUCKING BERNIE SANDERS ON HERE?I love Bernie and will be voting for him in the primary and general but even if you don’t agree with some of the things he says you gotta respect him. He’s been termed the “amendment king” over 30 years in congress and always is a no bullshit, honest guy. Look in to what Bernie believes before you hit him with bs labelsLegendaryThe way Bernie talks throughout this interview, his tone, his relaxed and quiet voice, he fucking cares about people. And he&#39;s spent his whole life fighting for working people. You can hear the compassion in his voice.Why doesn&#39;t Bernie pay his campaign staff $15/hr?8 thousand + don&#39;t like ordinary people and want big corp to f them!Bernie 2020 all the way. I’m not completely liberal and I have some questions about a few of his ideas but nobody comes close to him in terms of honesty, transparency and compassion. That’s what we need in America in 2019 post Trump. Remember that half the Democrats in this race are people Bernie and his campaign built up and got funding for in 2016. Nobody knew who Tulsi Gabbard and Kamala Harris were before Bernie.Can we have Joe Rogan the official moderator of the presidential debates?you know TN passed free tuition in 2014- and recently expanded it to include 4 yr schools without raising a single tax dollar- its thru the TN state Lottery which is owned by the state.Fuck that old socialist scum bag and fuck you to Rogan you little washed up not funny liberal cock suckerI held my breath scrolling the comments.  Glad people received Bernie well.300k in debt for med school <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=28m25s">28:25</a> , here in Canada they go to med school on the taxpayers dime then say: oh, the pay is too low here for MDs- I&#39;m headin&#39; south....m*****f***ers!!!Not a Bernie guy but respect for coming on the showHate Joe, love Joe ... that last question is just some GOAT behavior.I almost choked when I saw this let&#39;s hope bernie doesnt do that eitherAnd I thought MY hairline was receding.3 minutes in and hes already talkin bout free shit.. smhOMFG BERNIE!!The parking ramps at the Mayo clinic are full of cars with Canadian plates, it can&#39;t be that great.Proud to have voted Bernie in 2016! I lean more toward Tulsi Gabbard this time around though.BERNIE STOLE YANG’S WORDS!!The irony/confirmation just got an ad while watching this podcast from trintellix...Andrew Yang 2020I came here to trigger Libtards and shitpost.... I&#39;m all out of shitpost. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23walkaway">#walkaway</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23runaway">#runaway</a>You are not entitled to my earnings, ass hat.Bernie Sanders is a snake in the grass. Imagine going to the Soviet Union for your honeymoon in 1964.<br /><br />The f<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cking">#cking</a> guy is a millionaire himself! He&#39;s a coward and a hypocrite.<br /><br />Changes under &quot;President Bernie&quot; will be unpleasant. Like your good old truck? Forget it, you&#39;re getting a Prius. Think it&#39;s insane that healthy but confused 13 year old girls (who think they&#39;re boys) are having radical mastectomies? Too bad, it&#39;s the new normal. Enjoy freedom of speech? Sucks to be you - if anyone could possibly get hurt feelings from your words, Antifa will call you a N<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23zi">#zi</a> and beat you up; and &quot;President Bernie&quot; will smile.Absolutely love this long format. Thanks for doing this, Joe and Bernie! &lt;3Bernie is not a dictator, but the system he would put in place would put one on deckBernie For PRESIDENT !!! We need to protect this guy .. He&#39;s an enemy to big Pharma .. We need Bernie !!!say/type/think what you want..but Trump could not hang with the honesty of this platform..This was fucking great!Not to shit on the format, but these interviews aren’t any more useful than the debates when you’re not willing or able to push on the points, Joe.Don’t forget that if you’re in a closed primary state, that you need to switch your voter affiliation to Democratic months before your state’s primary in order to vote for Bernie!I was really hoping for some talk on the immigration crisis. I want to know what when we are going to get all these illegals immigrants out of here and move our funds and resources to the people who use our legal system.Can’t wait for higher minimum wage to speed up automation !Summary: I don&#39;t have the answer to that and I don&#39;t know. That will get you votes buddy.He keeps giving open answers to the real questions and kept going back to taking ppls money no bueno&quot;We will pay for &#39;free&#39; tuition by taxing wall street speculation&quot;<br />Brilliant, so not only will they have a definitionally worthless education; there won&#39;t be any well funded businesses around to hire them.thank you joe this is so eye opening for meTulsi for 2020Continues to just say what you want to hear. Wake up peopleI wonder if Donald Trump would come on? That would be sick AF.I love Bernie. I dont understand why anybody wouldnt want him as president. He literally wants to make everything easier and cheaper for the people. He wants free healthcare, who doesn&#39;t want free healthcare? He wants America to be Morally right. He is a saint. Also, as for somebody like me who is 27, a single father caring for my son, while working 50 hour weeks making 13$ an hour as a manager and I can hardly afford a 1 bedroom apt. If my truck breaks down I am totally screwed and will fall behind. Forget about school I can&#39;t even imagine affording that right now. I need dental work done, I cant get done because I cant afford it, even with my insurance. So if any medical bills arise I automatically go in debt and will end up in collections.Why even you speak in Bullshitese, Bernie. :) &quot;If I understand what you&#39;re saying&quot; - and then not answering the question.<br /><br />Eh. I guess shouldn&#39;t expect anything less.Well, he&#39;s got my vote.Joe has people on and makes them look like the nervous guest no matter how famous they are. Like the cunt could have some alien that killed all of civilization and itll be hesitant to speak<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=41m00s">41:00</a> banning certain guns aren&#39;t the issue. More education should be required to own a weapon. Not just background check. But a class or session about gun ownership and safety. It would create a whole new industry of gun education also. Probably help alot of ex military get jobs too.Make this nigga presidentFuck trump!Bernie is based and redpilled<br /><br /><br />&quot;elites&quot; &quot;the 1 percent&quot; &quot;(((they make the laws)))&quot; chad bernielol @ the dislikes. I have a feeling those same people treat what Alex Jones has to say seriously. Probably the type to fall for the drug company propaganda as well.Why doesn&#39;t he ask him about being a fucking commieYou know the value of you currency is what you place it at. Not how much you have.  A dollar is still a dollar the importance is how far it goes and how to stop inflationsI waited the whole time for Joe to bring up aliens, glad he snuck it into the endBernies answer is education. But education isn&#39;t for everyone. I&#39;ve got a lot of friends who dropped out of society and they aren&#39;t ever going to go to school and they never were. Education isn&#39;t the answer.I cant imagine our president having a conversation like this.all these cases have been made...over and over... we missed the lead the world boat. imho. maybe stop American military aggression.<br />Heal our homeland.Bernie is whispering as if Trump is in the other room waiting to pouncei live in canada and this isnt completly true we pay for lots of medical shitBernie Sanders 202025 mins in and all I’ve heard is talking points repeated over and over. So why does he need more than 45 secs in a debate?  I was really encouraged with the start but Joe has given him many opportunities to expand on complicated matters and Bernie just reverts back to trump is bad, corporations are evil, we will Rally.He just stole Yang&#39;s line about it being a reality tv show LOL. Fuck these politicians. YANG 2020.Bernie thank you for standing up for the people of our country.Not that this is the most important thing or anything but this is the quietest Bernie Sanders interview ever.I&#39;m still searching for the time I can waste to watch this.Let people with Diabetes and Cancer die (stop treating them), and lets see what happens.All I could think about was all of the jokes Joe has made about Bernie and his fucked up posture...Joe I don&#39;t agree with some of the stuff he says, but I appreciate you let him speak. Maybe one hour wasn&#39;t enough.I voted trump. love the man..<br /><br />America IS an oligarchy bernie really the truth. &quot;Working Men of All Countries, Unite!&quot;HAHAHAHAHA!!!! That last question about aliens 😆😆😆Blah blah blah, blah,  blah blah, blah blahI thought Joe knew the difference between literal meaning of mass shooting to what everyone thinks of when you say the word mass shooting.<br />Would of been a great chance to educate a leftist politician.Good dude.Disagree on 90% of what Bernie was saying, but man it was refreshing to hear someone from a different viewpoint be able to just talk.Finally.Dang, was hoping for some new Bernie info. If I got these questions before hand and was told I had an hour and seven minutes to answer them as if I was Bernie, I could’ve almost gone word for word.  How can somebody that complains so much about shitty coverage use a full hour on such a huge platform to talk about the same things we’ve heard him talk about for years?It is funny that Bernie complains of all the bad things of the “government”. He is the freaking government. How many years has he been in the “government”.Tax Churches.Donald Trump is nextIts odd that what Bernie is saying is what most high functioning European countries have done for decades already. People took a chance on trump but weren&#39;t willing to take a chance on Bernie to deliver on much needed improvements in quality of life across the board for the whole country?<br /><br />I mean if given a chance to deliver even on half of his promises I think it would be worth the gamble.Oh it&#39;s that guy who will never be presidentQuality here in Canada is NOT as good as the USAVery good ideals but no plans on how to implement them other than torches and pitchforks.Have on Trump!!!i was anti bernie before this and now neutral, as he&#39;s still a politician but....<br />thats how you do it mainstream media...Someone reach out to Tim, Jocko and Andy please.  We need to put a team together  to cover security for Joe.    ( half joking...)it&#39;s hard to spin that bernie is legit. he is a player in a 2 bit dog and pony show, he is owned like the rest. you should not encourage this bad behavior of the media gulag clown.A good number of Centrists and Right leaners are for stricter gun laws, but as soon as you talk about an “ all out ban “ we tend stop listening. Just FYI.In canada you&#39;ll die waiting for that free heart surgery....we have the best healthcare in the world. Go take your BS to the communist countries.I wonder if Bernie is taking 70 percent of the revenue?What sort of demented mind &#39;loves guns&#39;? That should be considered a mental illness. The fetishing of weapons is disgusting. Every gun owner, by definition, supports gun manufacturers and the NRA, because that&#39;s where the money goes. America, grow the fuck up and put down your death toys.You need to close loopholes on big business make everyone that does business in America pay taxes.&quot;The men the American people admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars; the men they detest most violently are those who try to tell them the truth.&quot;avowed communist who vacationed in the soviet union in the 80s is going on about gun grabbing. &quot;I&#39;m not radical&quot;BERNIE &quot;A high school degree is no good anymore&quot; lmao. Im a plumber,  making 200k a year. Because I work hard. As anyone else would if they work hard amd dont take on massive loans. GtfohDid he say “Brave people “?BERNIE SANDERS IS MY PRESIDENT!!!If healthcare is to be framed as a human right because it&#39;s so important, then why shouldn&#39;t food be a human right? Water? Sanitation?I&#39;m a huge Bernie fan, so I am biased.  I felt, however, that he gave great answers to Joe&#39;s tough questions.  Great podcast Mr. Rogan :).Complete nuts, but entertaining!I thought Bernie was wonderful and of course we&#39;re going to vote for him and TulsiFuck socialist sanders and everything that falls out his mouthbernie is senileDid he say “Brave people “?Medicare is not free. You become a slave to the government. Essentially your property and and all wealth passed on to child will be reduced to the amount paid by government for medical bills that accumulated in your lifetime. It’s absolute theft, do not be fooled. Bernie is a wolf in sheep’s costume.What Bernie won&#39;t say is they&#39;ve ran the numbers and found that even if we taxed the 1% at 100% of their income, we still couldn&#39;t pay for one entitlement program for more than 6 months. We&#39;ve also found that if you taxed the corporations at 100%, our government expenditures still exceed the revenue we bring in. The issue is cutting spending and Bernie won&#39;t dare do that.<br /><br />The difference between Bernie and his conservative counterparts is that Bernie focuses on how to divide the pie, conservatives focus on how to grow the pie for everyone. Much respect for Joe having him on though!To be fair, Canada has in insane issue with queuing for medical procedures. A medicare for all system needs to have some sort of solution for this.Joe, thank you for hosting Senator Sanders on your show and for not asking asinine questions like the mainstream media does!  Bernie Sanders is the only candidate for POTUS who is not beholden to corporate lobbyists and wealthy donor&#39;s interests!  He&#39;s the real deal!Fuck yeah, BTV represent Bernie!Bernie is by far the best candidate for 2020. Anyone who says otherwise just simply doesn&#39;t have their head on straight.I like him but this is 2019 and he will get assassinated by a drone strikeMy country is the best in the world ( For me ) Portugal.Hes got my voteNative-born Vermonter here- we (MANY of us) love Bernie. I vote for him every time ❤❤❤I feel bad for anyone who believes this career politician. He literally started off this podcast &quot;oh the DNC is trying to give everyone a fair shot!&quot; Except last election the DNC admitted in court (duckduckgo the transcripts) they can pick their candidate behind closed doors. The DNC will pick their deep state goon candidate and Tusli, Bernie, ect will all tell you to vote for the establishment pick.I like Bernie Sanders alot, but I just cannot get behind Socialism. It would be the beginning of the end for the USA.If you raise the minimum wage do the prices of goods go up? So what&#39;s the point of making $15 an hour minimum wage if groceries and gas cost more? It&#39;ll be the same thing it was beforeCmon joe, you gotta push back on some of the bullshit. Jack dorsey level of softballs.Bernie blows baby chunks...loony old cluckCanadas medicine is no longer free. And good luck getting apointment scheduled in a timely manor!Bernie Sanders seems like a nice guy, with attractive ideas, but he is wildly uneducated about human psychology. Like all utopians, Bernie hasn’t realized he just hates how people behave when they are free. He’d much prefer they behave how he thinks they should.Imagine if Alex Jones appeared out of nowhere 😂Bernie is good but yang is better <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi would fight Bernie on these issues every step of the way; they represent the same people as Mitch McConnell and agree with him much more than they do with Berniejoe hogan got all da clout<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>I used to be a fan until the fool rolled over for Hillary and joined the &quot;Trump is a racist, misogynist, Homophobe&quot; bandwagon.Jamie give the man a damn glass of water.I just want to see a Steven Crowder parody of this 😂😂😂<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m17s">23:17</a> <br />When Bernie gets tired of explaining the same thing to people who ask obvious questionsJoes gonna help pay for all the inefficient, permanent, unelected, unaccountable 4th branch of government- the administrative state.So exactly how are you going to pay for literally ANY of the plans he has without wrecking the economy and bankrupting the country. Truly musings of a man who has never had to make a payroll or a budget in his entire life.Just another piece of shit politician.But you wait in Canada.I know I live there.Bernie, jobs like taking orders at McDonald’s keep minds small! Adults raising kids don’t need to be paid more money for doing the least skilled tasks! They need incentives to get out in the real world. Then they’ll be paying their childcare workers decently and creating better value in society.Congratulations and kudos to you Joe for having Senator Sanders on your program. I would love to see the day when your program becomes a must-stop for all candidates running for office. This is how we should do the election process. Candidates one on one, being able to take the time to elaborate on their policies.Bernie AND bustRaise the minimum wage to 15 an hour and you’re right about all businesses will have to pay it. Seems like an even playing field until you realize that these corporations he seems to despise will be able to adjust while the small business owner can’t compete. Bernie’s problem is that he is so concerned with everyone else’s money. <br /><br />What is a fair share of someone else’s wealth? Is it so hard to understand that the richest person in the world isn’t preventing anyone from making their own fortune? Also I feel no pity for someone who racks up 100k in student loan debt pursing a degree with no practical application. Funny how the plumber, electrician, or someone pursing a STEM degree doesn’t suffer the same financial strain as a gender studies student.Omg I clicked on this so fast mainly because I thought it was a joke lolCant wait to watch this episode, but I&#39;m currently re-watching breaking bad. Hank just put 2 and 2 together while sitting on the shitter. I&#39;ll be back...show never gets oldThe US needs to lock Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul in a room to solve almost all political issues 😁 Get it done DanaYeeees!Joe is so scared of his precious little guns will be taken away. 🤣🤣🤣Hey Joe thanks a lot for That interview was very insightful makes more sense to hear him explain out his ideas. I agree his ideas are not radical and I get a sense that he really gives a shit about people.Whenever there is this much positivity in the COMMENTS section...you know something went rightBernie can go one hour and seven minutes without using the bathroom and taking a nap. Also he thinks starvation is funnyThe DNC is definitely being fishy with polls and pushing Biden. I haven’t met a single Biden Supporter but plenty of Yang, Sanders and Tulsi G supporters.I like Bernie, but I feel like all his did here was recite a list of issues without really explaining much.  For instance, a new tax of .5% on stock sales?  Huh?  How does this compare to the 15% to 20% capital gain tax already in place?  Sounds kinda ridiculous that he expects this would pay for all student loan debt.  Didn&#39;t even provide an estimate of what this tax might amount to.  Didn&#39;t explain it at all and seemed like he wanted to move on real quick.  Also, Joe did ZERO to challenge Bernie on literally anything he said.  This interview did not help me understand Bernie&#39;s positions any better.Bernandos net worth 2.9 mill plus. Rest in Cayman islands like the other millionaires hes talling about....probablyBernie 2020Joe you are a great listener and the unbiased uncensorship of different idesas is what I and others love to see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stopcencorship">#stopcencorship</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freespeechiswhatsup">#freespeechiswhatsup</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23aggreetodisagree">#aggreetodisagree</a> # <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%231st">#1st</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%232nd">#2nd</a> ect...Great, would love to see more candidates on here. BUT....... I would also love to see some form of fact checking on some of these points.Remember when Bernie was too old to be president? And yet he sounds 100x more presidential on a podcast with Joe Rogan than Trump has at any point in his life.Bernie “Did you beat up your wife?” SandersPhony couldn’t stand up to corruption when it went after him and you expect him to stand up for you? You must be a sucker9,000 people and counting triggered by the mere idea of a long form discussion w/ Bernie Sanders. How many actually listened?Somewhere out there Been Shitpiro, Candace Owens &amp; Donald Trump are crying cuckservative tears......<a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/100871/download">https://www.atf.gov/file/100871/download</a> Here is the official document by the ATF on selling guns during gun shows. It clearly states that you need a license to sell guns for profit and if you are licensed, you MUST conduct a background check. The gunshow loophole does not exist as a loophole because anyone who sold a gun for profit at a gunshow and was unlicensed broke the law. Therefore &quot;closing the gunshow loophole&quot; would be redundant policy. Determining if someone is mentally ill on a red flag based system is a better answer than sweeping gun control reform. Let people close to someone who is at risk determine if they are a risk to themselves or society and &quot;red flag&quot; and be heard before a court as to why they should not possess a gun.Canadians come to America to get better healthcare all the time everydayAwwww sheeeitIs this real life?  Rogan has the #2 Dem candidate on his podcast?  Legacy media pissing down their leg.  9.2 million people watched the second debate.  3.4 million have watched Rogan&#39;s interview with my boy Andrew Yang on youtube alone, a guy polling at 2%.  You&#39;re dying CNN.  You&#39;re dying FOX.Stupid ass Bernie Sanders your run-of-the-mill goblin.😂Joe this interview was fantastic to watch. Even though Bernie isn&#39;t my first choice, the platform he was given in this hour was incredible. Please bring on other candidates, I would love to see Warren come on.Bernie sounds like Joey Diaz if he lost his Cuban roots and became extremely white.2 old pplI always wondered if Bernia had tried DMTFuck I wish Joey was there that would have been crazy&quot;Virtually free&quot;<br />Nothing is free, virtual or otherwise.I’m hear to give everyone free stuff.   It’s all free.    Free everything.    Fine print.   You will pay 70% taxThis guy is too old to become Prez. We dont need another geriatric as commander in chief. He would be a great VP to Tulsi thoWhen he talks about expanding background checks to check for mental health and domestic violence its already ask you that on the form.  He&#39;s also wrong about gun shows not doing background checks.Welp, you know who to vote for now.  Fuck the big field and fuck trump.  Bernie all the way baby.Hearing a candidate being able to voice his or hers ideas and policies is a nice change of pace, thanks for this, we need more platforms like this. <br /><br />Not a big Bernie fan or Democrat persay, but he’s not as crazy as the media makes him out to be, thanks again joe.I LOVE YOU, BERNIE &lt;3<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Peace and Love for all ~Still think a Rogan Administration would be bestPeople think they need their guns to protect themselves from the government. News flash, the government has nuclear weapons. You have what amounts diddly squat. You and everyone else will be vaporized in a matter of seconds.Fuck you Bernie, you Socialist but nice podcast.Why didn&#39;t Joe ask why Bernie doesn&#39;t pay his campaign workers $15/hr?Did Bernie just say he loves dictatorships?Bernie needs to debate ben ShapiroI wish that could&#39;ve went on for 5+ hours. <br />Bernie 2020🔥🔥🔥Bernie 2020Watching for Bernie, not Joe...Joe can suck goat scrotsmust have been weird to have been Joe in this interview and hardly ever have Bernie look at him while him was talkingGot past the part about mental health and the drugs people are taking (around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=43m00s">43:00</a>) and instantly got an add for trintellix - a depression medication. Unreal. Just unreal.Public execution and humiliation are the only way to stop this problem. The death penalty isn’t enough to deter this crime. I want to own a gun to defend myself period. I would absolutely never ever use on anybody for any reason unless someone attacked me. It’s not fair for people like me that losers and bums shoot people and i have to give away my right to defend myself??? If you attempt to shoot anyone or are succesful automatic death sentence in public. I’m tired of this. Everyone wants to talk about mental health but no one even knows what that means or has a solution. It doesn’t take a psychologist to know that men are shooting people because they lack power and are lashing out in an unacceptable way to get it. The proper response for anyone who feels very bad and painful angry jealous etc is not violence. It’s called get a education work hard stop going out stop talking to girls get some money and you will get rid of your pain and if you don’t at least you tried honorably. Deep response to a deep problem.Drugs, again here they are Legal!!!!!! The is a minimum amount to transport and have it whit you to consume it. Some times I think America is so advanced in some think and and to much retarded in another ones. No good.Bernie, IN MY OPINION, will do all that he can for the American people, if he were elected POTUS.Bernie Sanders is dead wrongYOUMIN!Joe... you consistently do amazing things. But allowing this man, The Great and Powerful Bernie Sanders, to speak his mind honest and free is truly amazing. I will be sharing this with everyone I can, this needs to be heard. I hope others will do the same.&quot;A high school education is not good enouph any more, expand that through colledge&quot;<br />Yeah that&#39;s the ticket, kids are worthless, can&#39;t earn a &quot;living wage&quot; after 12 years of government indoctrination, lets extend that so they are worthless after sixteen, not enough extend it to birth 22+ years of completely worthless indoctrination. What a genius this Bernie is.Good interview. Invite Trump on next!I’m a huge trump supporter but I’m glad Bernie has a chance to speak without being censored and the game rigged against himEducation certainly is fucked, but I really <b>DON&#39;T</b> want Bernie fucking it any more. If you went to school in the 00&#39;s and you thought the lefty attempts to indoctrinate children were inappropriate... Imagine getting detention (re-education) for disagreeing.Bernie’s not my #1 but these things need to be out in the open for the average person to hear.  He’s been staying on message for literally decades however I think the solutions he’s putting forward can be updated and better delivered by other candidates. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a>Great job joe. Former presidents will be nice especially if we ask them with the alien questions lolHoly shitThis man would take over half of Rogans wealth and redistribute it in a heart beat, what a snakeGet trump onLove the passion that Bernie speaks with. It truly shows the authenticity of the purpose he&#39;s living with. Thanks for this interview Joe. Well doneKeep it up Joe , bring more people together rather than splitting them up.Who would you trust more to babysit your children ? Trump or Bernie ?I dont get why someone needs a weapon whose base design is to literally kill people as fast as possible in war.... shotguns cool handguns cool hunting rifles cool.... why you need an ak47 or tec9 or uzi or AR?......<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m46s">34:46</a> we have some of the most extensive background checks in the world regarding guns. The only thing lift would be to allow only former military to own weapons because they received extensive government training regarding firearms, but that impedes the 2nd amendment and it shall not be infringed. Every mass shooting we&#39;ve had over the last five years still happened because every shooter passed every background check we had. We need to address mental health and reaffirm our values for humans and calling for violence and death against political rivals spits in the face of that.I appreciate the shit out of Bernie and Joe for doing this.<br />I&#39;m so impressed by how this man has remained consistent in his values. He really cares about making life better for most Americans. He&#39;s fighting for a world/vision that he might not even live to see fully materialize. I really wish there were more elders like this man.Good job Bernie Sanders.  You already have the Senate.  Do it thru the Senate but since you flipped on second amendment I&#39;m gonna have to vote Trump again.  I was a huuuge Bernie supporter but he should never have joined the democratic party.  He should have stayed independent.  Also he should have fought back against Clinton.   I don&#39;t trust anyone who wants to destroy the second amendment.  I&#39;m voting Trump again.  Wake up people.Bernie&#39;s ideas are so garbage... why do people think this guy is intelligent?A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.Joe you fucking didn&#39;t have that crazy bastard answer any hard questions!

Thanks, Joseph!This was a really fantastic interview, Joe. I watched this with my parents and we all loved it. Just, honesty. That’s all people want, whatever you believe. We don’t see it often, anymore. Thanks for this. ❤️No more CORPORATE WELFARE!Just die already.Bernie is the OG of American politics 💙REALLY<br />CLIMATE CHANGE<br />REALLY <br />12 YEAR<br />OH BOIS<br />CHINESE WILL LOVE TO OCCUPY THOSE ISLANDS IN THE NEXT 12 YEAR<br />WHY TF US CARE ABOUT THOSE ISLAND ANYWAY<br />THEY ARE ALL UNDERWATER.<br />I CANT STAND ITBernie “ I just talk to someone last night..” SandersAmazing interview, great awesome job joe.This episode is freaking me out and I&#39;m Canadian... Can&#39;t imagine how you guys feel down thereAnd this is where I unsubscribe.AHHHH OMG YES! AMERICAS DAD IS ON JOE ROGAN 😭😭😭Lotta respect for you for doing this interview with Bernie, Joe Rogan. Honestly, this is the type of intimate interview that every Presidential candidate deserves. The Dem Debate was a real shitshow. A mess! (although &quot;I wrote the damn bill&quot; frikkin slayed me) 10 candidates trying to discuss/debate this country&#39;s major issues,  explain/defend their platforms, etc. in little 10, 15, 30 second clips?! Its just a really piss poor way of doing things. Something as important to all our futures as a Presidential election should NOT feel like a poorly-directed Reality TV show lol.Never clicked on anything fasterTrump 2020Alex Jones and Bernie podcast lets goI’m a libertarian, and I thank you for having Bernie Sanders on the podcast Joe RoganThis episode is short af, did he die at the end or something?Bernie, <br />“In the best of all possible worlds...” <br />no one would need an “assault” weapon.Good on you for having Bernie on. But for someone that&#39;s literally a career politician, I was really hoping he&#39;d talk honestly about how many officials today put their party and their dogma before their country or constituents. It&#39;s a serious problem, and Bernie has contributed to it. If a president of the opposite party tries to tackle an issue, the other party will stop them anyway they can. Effectively hurting the American people all because they cannot allow the other party to do anything good, in case it hurts their party. That&#39;s modern day politics for both sides, and Bernie is as guilty as anyone.Do trump nextlol.. alot of falst shit being spewed here.I may not agree with everything Bernie had to say but he earned a lot of respect from me from  actually hearing the guy talk for an hour!What dont presidential candidates just have there own you tube channels. Then we vote.Old Communist fart. I hate that Bernie guyyo wtfI&#39;m pretty sure we were at war with Japan in ww2Can this be Joe #1 viewed video??? 🤔Bernie works for the bad guys. Why else do you think he wants to ban rifles? You can mass murder with a ridiculous number of weapons. The only reason they want rifles taken away, is bad guys wanna do somethin bad and harmful to large amounts of people, and everyone having proper rifles, would be a problem for them. Hitler didnt want anyone to have guns either...Need Peter Schiff Bernie sanders on same episodeBernie would destroy our economy FIRST in attempting to &quot;lead&quot; the world.Why isn’t this 3 hours or moreIm not a fan of Donald trump but ..... please Donald Trump on JRE!!!We’ll never be socialists. Sounds great doesn’t work. This is not a never looked into socialism person as i am/was open to it but stack the facts up from every failed experiment in socialism for the last 100 years and its real grim with no promised utopia. People have a hard time controlling their lesser instincts in a free democracyWhy don’t politicians start podcasts? That way I can get a better idea of the policies and the message they bringBernie also said that people lining up for food was a “good thing”. <br /><br />C’mon people. The guy, like most socialists, is a nut.Why isn&#39;t Joe asking how Bernie would balance the fucking budget?! How does he pay for this?!Ok but is J.R going to allow any other candidate to clarify their agendas on this platform 🤔 not like if any of theirs are worth listening to 😂 nicely done, Joe. You’re directing the  millennials to the smart guysI’m personally a Bernie supporter and tbh I’ve never been able to fully listen to Bernie’s (almost) entire policy direction at one time elaborately. Every but of information has had to be pieced together due to how little coverage our candidates get in mainstream. It’s wild that the only place where I could’ve gotten this info is on his Instagram page.. til now 😹Bernie is an evil person who wants to steal people&#39;s money at gunpoint. F*** him.Joe you are awesome, great platform for these candidates, get as many as you can on both sides.Joe thanks for having Bernie on - Great, but YOU have to take a deeper dive into climate change - it is happening but not the way it’s being scammed on us. Climate change PREDICTION is BIG MONEY!  In 2018 the GOA published that the US government has spent $154B on PREDICTIONS since 1993 with $0.0 approachable results. Climate change is happening but not to the extent as advertised!  Please have Green Peace founder Patrick Moore on to talk about the “REALITY “ of Climate Change!Lost my vote!You wanna really know what&#39;s going on in America just ask the kids imagine what teenagers think about what&#39;s going on right now.Therapy - Family/Couple Counseling, Ect... Need&#39;s to be included in Healthcare for all. We need serious help.You don&#39;t have my vote.Shame that the environment isn’t getting more attention in the developing election. Especially the nexus of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23climatecrisis">#climatecrisis</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23transition">#transition</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nuclear">#nuclear</a> , and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23circulareconomy">#circulareconomy</a>Bernie is dead right on the issues and causes. Pay close attention to his proposed solutions, because he even knows they wont work.Sanders explanations are still unrealistic , full of holes and couldn&#39;t stand up to debate from an informed high school studentOmg joe u got Bernie😂😂.... i’ll give Bernie one thing for his age he has a lot of energy but he will not win the nomination and any of those  Democrats has 0 chance of beating Trump. Those are just facts  peopleSoap Box Derby are my favorite kind of race because all you need is a Box some wheels and some way they get down the Hill what a push . Amazingso its a fact all politicians lie or they have money behind them telling them what the talking points are... How much of this was talking points.... Joe why didn&#39;t u ask him how he felt about Clinton campaign interfering with his 2016 run and how he feels about running under the same party again.     A matter of self respect if it was me.     He says we have to do something ... even if we do it ... maybe in 5 years or 10 its doesn&#39;t change anything ... now let me guess he wants even more.. should have also asked him about taxes - what his plan... guessing raise all taxes to support his government funded programs and lifting all wages across the board.   If he is genuine i would be with him but you see, i don&#39;t trust any politician.... and he is a career politician - never held a private job....Hey joe just a quick thought you gotta get TARANTINO on your show!!!! His new movie is great.I wish you grilled him as hard as you grilled Larry Sharpe.I think Bernie is one of the most genuine politicians around, however I think his policy proposals are pretty terrible. He’s right healthcare is broken, but it’s broken because the marketplace is broken, not capitalist greed. Government involvement might improve things, but it will still be broken.Bummer that such a promising candidate is tied to banning gunsThe tobacco industry lied.. the pharmaceutical companies lie.. the banking cartels lie.   Who are the largest contributors to congressional campaigns.? Again Bernie I&#39;s a joke and hypocrite.Love Bernie!Should of been more than just an hourGet Bernie and Ben Shaprio together. We&#39;ll see if fast talking Ben can keep up with this old dude.Very good interview, let’s see all the candidates on here! And give people that anti gravity machine to end fossil fuels! LolAfter watching this, I dislike Bernie less and disagree with him more.From Canada, this guy doesn’t have a fucking clue. What is my tax rate?... 47% our health care sucks, 8 month wait for an mri or cat scan. I had to wait for my surgeries a year and a half. Why are my friends and family traveling to the United States for cancer treatments?Oh, so you mean that that out of control capitalism is the problem?  I am not a socialist... I just think they&#39;re a lot of loopholes in the regulation of businesses.Hell yeah! Feel the Bern! 🔥great show! wow joe is just getting bigger, better, and more influential.  well deserved, he does media likes its truly meant to be doneim canadian i live 30 mins from the states boarder i have family that go to the states to get major surgeries done. the wait times are very long and guess what when you get to finally see a doctor they try to get you out as fast as possible because there is so many people that are comming in for things that shouldn&#39;t be coming in for.Boooooo joe. If you wouldn&#39;t give airtime to a Nazi you shouldn&#39;t give air time to a communist. Every word out of his mouth is unsubstantiated trash.<b>Shit wait Bernie is Littlefinger from Game of Thrones :O :O</b> if u vote democrat it&#39;s like Edard Stark trusting Petyr Baelish and climate change (especially hypotheticak methane farts) is different from pollution and HAARP etci may disagree with almost everything bernie sanders says, but god damn it hes the only honest person on the democratic side and i appreciate that shit out of that.Joe, why do you think fixing the shitty neighbourhoods will solve anything ? Do you think those neighbourhoods weren&#39;t nice to start with ? If fixed what&#39;s stopping them from going back to the way they were ? Fathers walking out on their families &amp; out of wed lock pregnancy need to change before anything else. You have to get to the root of the problem. It starts with the family.There aren&#39;t going to be single answers for the mass shootings because it&#39;s intertwined with so many issues. To answer the mass shootings we have to answer how to improve our awareness and treatment of mental and physical health, we need to address automation replacing jobs, we need to address how we scapegoat our financial issues on racial decisions, we need to figure out how to educate Americans on credit and debt, and we need to figure out how reduce the ways in which people obtain any weapon that can cause mass death in the matter of seconds. All these issues( and more) are what add up to people going fucking nuts. Just tackling one aspect might slow it down for a bit but it doesn&#39;t address the issueJoe Rogan you have stooped!bernie killed it. man that dude makes a lot of sense rnHow is the youth of America ever going to succeed if this around the buy criminals.  We need more jails we need to build more jails.  Get rid of a bad seeds so the baby seeds can grow up without the bad seeds influence what am i saying that I mean look at what the youth I don&#39;t cAre if you are in  white black Asian Mexican are listening to the crap it&#39;s pump down their throats.  . Is so hard to listen to him talk cuz he&#39;s like in a perfect is utopia.Amazon and Disney are completely different from a franchise most franchise these days are barley staying alive they cant afford this new cost of 15$ an hourThis is the platform that politics needs today great work joeJoe: so about such and such<br />Bernie: well I talked to so and so<br />Joe: ok so how do you fix this<br />Bernie: well if you look back to the 60s.<br />Joe I&#39;m glad you interviewed this man. I&#39;m still exercising my right to vote by not voting. I wanted to like bernie but he gave me nothing more than a politicians awnserI disagree with just about everything that Bernie stands for but it’s nice to have him given a platform for long form discussion. I do wish he would have pressed him harder on the minimum wage issue considering what is going on within his own campaign.&quot;I went through public education&quot;<br />Maybe that would explain why you never earned an honest dollar in your life, got rich through political welfare, Bernie.The question about the aliens would make Bernie think either Joe is stupid or the followers of the podcast are stupid.This is going to be a fun one to debunk for conservatives and libertarians. Cool interview though.💝👏👏👏This man will be the greatest President since FDR.Give free education to people studying math, science and engineering.  Students studying social justice (who&#39;ll never get a job) need to pay their own way.I always think about joe eating a cockroachDoes that mean I won’t need health insurance? I sell insurance so that makes me nervous for my JOB<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=21m20s">21:20</a> - &quot;I dont think its asking our employers too much to pay a $15 min wage&quot; That is over double the current min, that is A LOT to ask for Bernie.    Walmart, double your pay for your employees who do entry level unskilled labor.Have a Podcast with the top 5 candidates and make it 5+ hours long. It will be a great service to this country!Almost 10k dislikes... I guess there’s a lot people who are mad about their Brain’s being in recovery mode from taking in so many high level important ideas.I find it kind of odd he said, &quot;we are getting to the end of your hour here&quot;<br /><br />Since when is this an hour only show lol?Instead of the debates each candidate should come on JREIts not a radical idea its a nonsensical idea. Go out into the middle of the woods by yourself and declare you have a right to healthcare, see if the healthcare fairy pops up and treats you.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m27s">2:27</a> Ross who?? can&#39;t figure out the nameJoe Rogan is the new Walter Cronkite..... He may be the only unbiased interviewer in America. Watch out Joe it’s only a matter of time before the news media takes aim at you . They don’t like their power and monopoly on news messed with.This was the funniest interview you’ve ever done! Bahahahaha Bernie!🤘🏽🤘🏽“Jesus Christ Joe”.... Steve Rinella“assault weapons”YOU-man rights or human rights ? 🤦🏽‍♂️MAGA 2020fuck bernieYou&#39;ve grown on me Joe ! Subbed !From Larry Sharpe to Bernie Sanders, Joe is truly a legendNow you need President Trump on.Am I the only one on this thread concerned about every one of his solutions involving something that’s “free?”Jesus lord Bernie Sanders on Joe showThey should have someone else other than the mainstream running the debates. Where is the rule that says CNN or Fox News get to run the debates?I lose brain cells when I listen to BernieI’m a conservative but found this discussion interesting I really liked the part where Bernie talks about how European candidates get interviewed uninterrupted and how we should incorporate thatBernie reminds me of magicians that do the dropping head trick. LolThank you Joe Hogan for letting Mr. Sanders speak!Plz be the president berdawgThanks for this hour. I look at things some different now.  Bernie is a serious person that has some great ideas.Did Bernie just announce he&#39;s going to take his clothes off at the next debate?Joe, you appeal to a broad range of people, and I appreciate you giving these politicians a chance to come on and get time to dig I to issues. TV isn’t suited for this and you are, please keep it up and open the doors to anyone brave enough to sit across from you.The mental health crisis in america  is   shown in the  number of  people  who still vote  for  the  socialist democrats ...Bernie is a slippery one. It&#39;s all sunshine and rainbows.... until everyone is getting taxed 70% and cant pay rent. Who cares if you are making even a 20 dollar minimum wage when your take home after taxes is 6 dollars an hour. Its smoke and mirrors to be more authoritarian and have more control.couldn&#39;t be further from the facts on &#39;assault weapons&#39; jesus its a semi auto period. not a NFA class 3.All he&#39;s gonna do is give his delegates to Kamala. I&#39;m tired of socialist politicians thinking they know what&#39;s best for my family. And let&#39;s say the DNC actually nominates him? He would destroy the country overnight!I’m glad Hillary fucked youI’m a conservative as well and I got to say, Bernie doesn’t seem too radical as I thought he was. Very interesting topics and discussion. Respect to both.15/hr = less food stamps, less social benefit programs etc and higher tax revenue for the government...There are 1/10 the number of Canadians as Americans and i see how horrible the service is for free healthcare there. It’s horrible here for for-profit healthcare.  TOO MANY PEOPLE. Kill off 80-85% of Americans and I’ll support medicare for all.  Meanwhile you all go crazy if 20 people are shot at Walmart!I would vote for Bernie over Trump if they&#39;d just make him the front runner.I still love Bernie, but I gotta call him out the first 30 seconds in! <br /><br />Bernie on the debates: &quot;What they are are reality t.v. shows&quot; Getting influenced by Yang I see ;)I was left questioning reality for a few moments. Holy shit.What he fails to mention it takes anbinsanely long timebto get subpar care in CanadaSure the climate might change and all humans will probably go extinct but the Earth itself will be fine.I love this format. We need an hour and a half sit down no audience type conversation like this with him and biden. And have it broadcasted EVERYEHERE so people can finally see the CLEAR differences between the two.You need to get Andrew Yang back on the podcast!!Only have one question about raising the minimum wage to $15... What keeps the landlords, restaurants, clothing stores, and other goods to raise their prices?? Bernie states that the cost of living is high...Never give up your gunsAwesome interview, you did a great job in asking all of the right questions Joe. Can’t praise you enough, one of my favorites so far.damn Im a jags and devils fan... this is the first sell out I have seen in over a yearThis is our next president and a new era of American prosperity!Whaaaaaaaaat this happened.Bernie was junking some questions like Barry Sanders. He some good ideas. In theory.I see a lot of praise for Bernie doing this (format of) interview. I do think it is kinda cool for Bernie to come the JRE however, despite similar topics from the debate being brought up: 2nd amendment, Healthcare, the Border he wasn&#39;t  presented these issues in the same format we see here. Joe Rogan is an excellent interviewer and what we&#39;re watching is an interview. Not direct, hard pressed questions. Early in the video Sanders complains that he doesn&#39;t like the quick 40 seconds allotted time he is given for responses at the debate. I think he knows those 40 seconds are a blessing not a curse.All socialists are rotten commies. That said everybody should be able to express their ideas (even Berine as much as i hate his politics) without a fake news spin. Rogan is great in this regard.Joe...great interview! Your podcast is at a higher level than anything on t.v.. Much praise to how you ask questions and LISTEN to your guest. Your the best.First show I&#39;ve ever watched thru start to finish in one sitting. 10/10HOLY SHIT IT HAPPENEDYang pointed out that the debates are a reality TV show. Where&#39;s his sound byte?Bernie slipping in an Alex Jones gimmick of ripping off his clothes and yelling like an idiot.Imagine if he actually got elected 🤔 and actually did everything he wanted to do , it would be literally make America great againi dont have cable so this is how im watching the other sides opinion. I support Trump but you have to know all the arguments or else you dont have an honest opinion.Look 👀 up Panama 🇵🇦 papers it will tell you everything corrupt in the world 🌍Thanks for the awesome interview Bernie! Excellent job!Reselling gums that you bought to criminals is a felony!Good one 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏Government shouldn&#39;t be involved in literally anything.No one: <br /><br />Literally no one:<br /><br />Seriously not a soul: <br /><br />Bernie: “AgEnDeR”I want to like Bernie... but he needs to either do actual research or stop embracing anti gun dogma. The blanket term of “assault weapons” with no actual definition is concerning. Simple solution is link firearms with a drivers license. You want CDL? Drive a motorcycle? You want own an AR-15? Just another check mark.These are as far as the government should go. These are similar responsibilities... if you are allowed to operate a vehicle then you should be able to own a firearm.Simplicity is typically a better approach.Nuclear energy is the only proven route to eliminating carbon emissions. Maybe let&#39;s look at why France is beating Germany at producing emission-free energy.The 2nd amendment has nothing to do with hunting in Vermont ya old fuck. <br /><br />And when 99.9% of people would never do any harm to another (VIA YOUR DAMN MOUTH BERN!) THEN WE DO NOT LET THE .1% RULE THE FUCKING 99.9%. <br /><br />This is why your list of &quot;free&quot; shit will never work as well.No worse than nuclear attack drills. Get over it. Teach those kids trigger discipline and focus.Help Us Bernie Wan Kenobi, you&#39;re our only hope ...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=37m35s">37:35</a> bernie dosent understand the second amendmenthey Joe can you make sure you get a pro Counter-Strike player on episode 1337? It&#39;s importantYou can watch Bernie and see he really cares about the average american person and he dose want the best for our country. That&#39;s what ppl need to see and realize it dosent matter if their a repub or dem. I wish that was the way we voted. I might not vote for Bernie bit if he won id feel like our country was in good hands. Sadly thats not the case with all the ppl running for president, but somee ppl dont care their just gonna vote for the dem or repub because thats the side their on. They act like its a football game, just want their side to win they dont care about the issue&#39;sBernie &quot;I don&#39;t have any magical answers&quot; SandersYES YES YES!! What a breathe of fresh air to hear this man speak.GET MITCH ON THE SHOWHoly shit! Good job Joe!Noam Chomsky next 👀Omfg Joe gag lol did you bring him some pudding cupsSo when you want &#39;free healthcare&#39; all you&#39;re doing is giving more power to the central banks by asking them to steal from you more using inflation (taxation is completely irrelevant, it&#39;s just to confuse you and blind you to reality, give you something to think about). They simply print more money to cover the &#39;cost&#39; of your healthcare. This means you&#39;re paying for your healthcare your entire life by the erosion of your currency&#39;s value. This means you steal from everyone else and every future person ever to exist in your nation when you get &#39;free healthcare service&#39;. But because YOU don&#39;t have to pay for it, you feel good, even though you&#39;re a dirty disgusting thief. You just don&#39;t understand how it works, so your ignorance allows you to feel good about yourself when instead you literally stole a small amount of value from everyone around you.<br />The main point is Bitcoin eliminates all this and achieves what you want. You want nations to serve citizens, and I agree. In doing so they will have to give up the stealing of labor. This means giving up all &#39;free&#39; services too. Because instead of offering &#39;free healthcare&#39; with Bitcoin, they&#39;d literally have to require people to send in payments to cover healthcare costs, because they couldn&#39;t steal the labor over a long period of time using inflation to fool everyone into ignoring the fact that they&#39;re paying for the healthcare their entire life.<br /><br />Every time the central bank prints money, they keep some for themselves. This means it&#39;s costing you more over your entire life to receive your &#39;free healthcare&#39; that you think is so good. Because it&#39;s not only costing you the price, but also the inflation value, plus the fee the central bank takes every time they print money for you.<br />^This is just as copy &amp; paste- I don&#39;t advocate relying on bitcoin.

Listen to this guy. He&#39;s not a crony, we finally have a politician who actually will fight for all Americans rights. Let&#39;s do our part!

I&#39;d give up the ability to buy a AK or an AR15 for free healthcare.  ;).  Before him i was a Ron Paul republican, but the system has to change and Bernie is the man to change it.I&#39;d give Bernie a shot...LOL get this communist clown outta hereThe 10k downvotes are from butthurt Trumpanzees ahahaha you can&#39;t stop democratic socialism you fucksBernie sanders nakedIt would be awesome if he could get the top 5 dem. candidates on the podcast for an epic long form debate!I was a Trump guy but was saddened to see not much of a change in the opioid crisis or the healthcare of the US in recent years. Maybe, if it&#39;s Bernie or an anti-corporate democrat in presidency, he&#39;ll do something different, though I&#39;m not sure.Bernie: &quot;50 years ago do you know how much the university of California costs? Virtually free.&quot;<br /><br />Joe: &quot;what is it now&quot;<br /><br />Bernie: &quot;I dont know.&quot;<br /><br />I wont disagree that college is more expensive but come on man. At least try and back up your claim. What is virtually free? What is that number adjusted for inflation?<b><i>I HATE TO SPOIL IT FOR EVERYONE, BUT AT THE </i></b><b><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=45m32s">45:32</a></i></b><b><i> MARK, BLACK LIVES MATTER ENDS UP TAKING OVER BERNIE&#39;S MICROPHONE.</i></b>Bernie Sanders only knows how to speak in slogans. He can’t explain any of his policy proposals even in a forum like Joe’s show where he has as much time as he wants. All slogans and no realistic proposals.Great show! We’re so lucky to have this podcast. Rarely got to hear this level of depth last election.He didn’t want to pay his employees the minimum wage he suggested then when he caught heat for it he gave to them but cut their hours drasticallyBernie 2020 ❤✊🏽Dislikes are people who think he’s a nazi socialist. PlebsThe last question was greatBernie is just blowin smoke. He&#39;s not doing anything for anybody. This is all for himself.I’ve heard a lot of things about Bernie but never got to hear him speak on a platform like this and I have to say I’m very impressedBernie is dumber than i thought...  he actually believes his nonsense that has and will never work.Same ol same ol like the republican same ol same ol and all the gubment ‘fo’s same ol same ol. Don’t vote. Come up with something newClimate change isn’t just the USA look at humanity! people keep populating the world it’s going to get warmer! come on it’s bigger than just emissions and fossil fuelsHere in Brazil, we have this system that he mentioned in the beginning, where all networks have to give a certain time of the day to politicians to run their campaigns for free... Nobody watches that shit. They shut down the TV and go online instead... it doesn&#39;t work and just pisses people off...If Joe gets the opportunity he would interviewed satan. The next day God.Bernie: so the thing about the DNC is<br /><br />Joe: wait, you do DMT?Most of this I agree with but most of the gun reform I am not sure about ,most people who legally buy a gun isnt gonna use it for bad considering the serial number can track back to them ....the illegal distribution of weapons and modified weapon made accessible by some parts of say the dark web ,if we happen to change the laws radically towards only giving pistols persay ,bad people we just order their assault rifles online where as the good law abiding citizens have handguns for protection......everything other standpoint he has I mainly agree with but the crack down on the illegal distribution of weapons is a bigger concern especially one of criminal activity ,school should have security that is trained to use nonlethal and lethal force when permissible, of course increases in cameras and servalience, and many other things ,we cant just stop it with one thing .....there are many problems in the area of arms (and of course more training for cops dealing with mental disorders and conditions)Let&#39;s not forget the 33 billion dollars the U.S. promised to give Israel over the next 10 years.I wanna break his face .... his voice is annoying as hell ...17 peeps killed in Chicago last weekend. <br />No news coverageAlot of people on the right keep saying Bernie is a communist man eater or something like that.<br />Like, I hate generalizations like that but I replied to like, 20 comments about this same talking point.<br />I have only seen a few well thought out arguments even opposing Bernie. Like, either on left or right.<br />What the fuck internet?<br />Also, nice podcast. Bernie stole it. No idea where the comments came from. Probably just people too biased to listen to another argument.He still doesn&#39;t say how all this will be paid for and that&#39;s by taxing every American to the point where we have less money than we do nowJoe Rogan does an incredible job interviewing his guests for one reason and one reason only. He has no agenda. He asks questions with curiosity and a desire to understand his guests views. Joe just keeps it real. Bernie needs to be the next president. He will make the US a better place to live. Period.Part 2: Bernie and Alex Jones talk about aliensBernie 2020. He&#39;s really the only chance for working class and the middle class to balance what the wealth class has taken for too long.Voted for him in 2016 and I will most certainly vote for him in 2020.Ive heard america is heading to more of a oligarchy government?Got a advertisement from a drug company yo haha fuck!Love you Bernie but keep your clothes on.President Rogan has a nice ring to it. VP Sanders to guide the transition to automated direct democracy.BERNIE 2020 WE CAN DO THIS!!Although I don’t agree with Bernie I don’t feel like his intentions are bad. I don’t think it’s going to work realistically but i don’t think anybody would complain about free college, healthcare etcjoe rogan 2020I wish Joe would have asked Bernie about his 3 houses, 2 in Vermont and 1 in DC and how he amassed 1.5 million in 2016. I wonder if those 3 houses are solar?  Like Al Gore who’s carbon footprint is 50 times that as mine it’s hard to take him seriously.  I like people that walk the talk. Every single American rich or poor has to do their part to fix this earth. It starts with the person running our country.Interview Adam 22!!!! On boys!Love you Bernie! Voice of the peopleis joe gonna be the first mma president ? hmmmmmm hehe :)Look, Joe Rogan is no Bill Maher. And that&#39;s a good thing.America fought Germany and China in WWII?  Japan and ItalyBernie! Bernie! Bernie!Bernie got litttt around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m26s">23:26</a>  why yell so intensely...Joe&#39;s just asking.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=30m00s">30:00</a> I need to give a counter argument to Bernie&#39;s views here. Bernie doesn&#39;t want to tax just billionaires on Wall Street. He wants to tax traders. There are thousands of average family people who trade the stock market for a living. And guess what? 90% of them lose money EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Bernie get a grip you are taxing people who are already at a loss when you buy a stock what gives you the idea you&#39;re guaranteed to make money off of it? Over 50% of stocks go DOWN not up every year even in bull markets. I believe that Bernie means well but he&#39;s not educated enough on finance to understand the ramifications of this bill, one of which by the way is it would oh I don&#39;t know CRASH the stock market causing another recession.FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!Even though I’m a conservative, it was very nice seeing Bernie get a chance to speak freely. I wish this was what each candidate got to do.The Bernie fans just came out of the woodworks. Cringe.Other countries do not pay for the medications the U.S. hasAll that he says makes sense minus him praising democrats who have been off the hinge lately. My biggest concern is why did he endorse someone who (factually) cheated him in the last presidential democratic primaries? Why does he never bring it up?Lets get this man into office! A man of the people🇺🇸Im a conservative but i love this so much it gives u a chance to really understand where the other side is coming from and why they think the way they do i really wish every candidate could have this opportunity very interestingThe comments are far more pleasant than I anticipatedPlease Bernie!!! We need a batshit crazy, senile communist to save us all from too much freedom! Help help!As far as guns go, the problem is the constitution was signed in 1789. At this time they were using muskets, muzzle loaders, and bayonets. 100 years later they created the first style gatling gun called a mitrailleuse that fired 100 rounds a minute. That&#39;s not what they were referring to with the right to bare arms. If you argue that, you&#39;re a bottom feeder at heart.What a nice sensible rational discussion...there is hopeBernie doesn&#39;t need a teleprompter or written speech to fill an hour, the man speaks from his heart about the issues he&#39;s been fighting for basically his entire life. Even if you don&#39;t agree on every single aspect, he has the interest of the bottom 99% of Americans as his priority. The future he&#39;s proposing is bright, and he has the most logical way to pay for it - stop and reverse the corruption that is breaking our country. No politician makes more sense when you actually listen to what he&#39;s saying.HE FUCKING DID IT. BERNIE FUCKING DID IT. And look at that like-dislike ratio. Looks like the conservatives aren&#39;t so rampant here after all.Joe:You can&#39;t get uninterrupted time on TV because they show an ad every 15 minutes.<br />Video: Has 2 ads at the start and 6 ads throughout<b>Hercule from DBZ = Bernie Sanders if Hercule was more like Frieza lol</b>I&#39;m so fed up with legislators who simply ignore everyone except those giving them payoffs called lobbying.  I&#39;m embarrassed by the nonstop wars, the cost of health care and drugs, etc.As long as money is debt not much will change. I don&#39;t think the banking cartel has a problem with Bernie other than their subsidiary companies that may have to pay higher taxes.Bernie is the man common sense solutions for real problemsMost people dont even see the enormous headphones! I cant ignore it and it drives me nuts after being a bit comical.  Now you live with it!!That was incredible. Easily the best interview of Bernie Sanders I have seen. Joe, you did an amazing job.So boring😴The 2nd Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting, BernieBernie is an idiot when it comes to 2ASince most TV outlets are severely biased, Joe should invite all the candidate and give them an hour like this. This was awesome, I got to learn more about Bernie&#39;s vision<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=22m18s">22:18</a>. That’s because the top 1% accounted for 37% of all taxes paid in the US. That’s more than the bottom 90% combined. Now yes, that’s cause they make the money to be taxed. But we can’t tax these people an unlimited amount. They pay the vast majority of the the taxes in this country and we’re STILL 20 trillion dollars in debt. We could literally take all their money, and it wouldn’t pay for a 1/10th of all free healthcare / college in the US.I think the main contributor to mass shootings is something that no one ever seems to talk about; our egocentric culture.  We are a nation of individualists who all want to be special, and at the same time, are comparing ourselves to false versions of people who nobody can live up to.  The very way we think is self-centered, along with materialism, ego is synonymous with America; just ask anyone from other countries.You have no right to other peoples goods and services.All you morons that are buying Bernie’s bs, you should castrate yourselves.Bernie/Tulsi #2020 would whoop Donald Trump&#39;s ass. Before you start hating on this and calling me lib or whatever..I voted Trump. I didnt like Hillary, and wanted a good economy. But hes a fucking bozo, and people like me (that instantly regretted hitting that button on voting day, then hoped for the best) wont make that mistake again.Go vegan save the environment and animals. Takes a lot to feed sixty billion animals annually.EAT THE RICH.Good job there&#39;s a stand because that mic would&#39;ve been dropped, dropped, dropped, dropped dropp...Forget about both parties! A pox on both their houses! Income inequality is a verifiable issue.JRE should take over the political debates. Have actual conversations instead of yelling matches.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=18m50s">18:50</a> - &quot;Every idea I have is supported by a majority of the american people, these are not radical ideas&quot;.  No they are not supported. People who cant afford things might like the idea of getting a bunch of stuff for free but just about everyone else that pays their own way dont agree. If you raise the min wage for entry level unskilled labor jobs it means some people are getting fired, replaced by robots, or the cost of the product will raise to account for the cost.All the dislikes are NPCs losers and Trump fanboys.Joe needs to have Trump on.... It&#39;d break the internet.Alex Jones fans and Fox News addicts saw  &quot;Bernie Sanders&quot; in the title, and immediately hit that dislike button. Joe has never pandered to one particular side of the political spectrum. Plus, many of Joe&#39;s comedian friends support Sanders to a certain degree. This invite was inevitable.120 years of gun lawsBernie is rational proponent of many good things, like raising minimum wage....but when it comes to his own pocket, his own staff complains about him underpaying them. Wheres my extra two bucks Bernie? Let me see any of these socialists run a business first, or donate 2/3 of their own wealth to their community.  Lead by example 👻🧁I honestly be concerned for my dude Bernie...He’s a straight-up G...He knows and understands that he can’t do it by himself and that the power for change is through “the people”. 👊🏾✊🏾🚀<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=37m56s">37:56</a> You asked so I&#39;ll answer. I thought about it. You can&#39;t define the term &quot;assault weapon&quot; but are prepared to ban them. You mention hunting in the same breath as the 2A you claim to believe in as if they have ANYTHING to do with one another. You brush off self-defense as a legitimate use case without making an argument against it. Based on this interview, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re well versed enough on this topic to have an opinion therefor no solutions you&#39;re prepared to offer are worth my time considering. You seem to be towing a line without thinking it through. We have enough of that in DC already. Hard pass.At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m40s">1:04:40</a> did he think the US fought China in WW2????Joe &quot;I forgot how to call people out on their bullshit &quot; RoganThanks Joe for these videos!!Never hit so fast on JRE episode as this time.It&#39;s not a greed issue, it&#39;s a regulation issue. If people could buy insulin at 1 tenth the price from canada they would. We need more freedom in the healthcare marketplace. Suppliers with low prices have been removed from the marketplace.&quot;All this can be yours for a low low price of 75% of your income.&quot; Good lord! This is the same government that couldn&#39;t get a website up and running. The same government that told you your insurance cost would go down. The same government that said there are weapons of mass destruction all over Iraq. The same government that gave Epstein a slap on the wrist after he molested children. Bernie is no hero and all of you that buy this are not thinking clearly. The world is not ending in 12 years. You absolutely cannot get rid of fossil fuels. All of your phones are made of plastic. Your houses are furnished with it. Your house is heated by it. I know why he is popular. He promises big things and it all sounds great. But when the price of food doubles and you are paying more than half your income to these spend happy degenerates you will know why the other half of the country voted against it. Trump is not the most well spoken man we have ever had in the office but he is a realist. He knows none of these policies are sustainable. As for guns... if you think going after assault rifles is a good idea then you are sadly mistaken. That&#39;s how you start a civil war. If someone would have raised their kids right mass shootings would not happen. It&#39;s not a gun problem it&#39;s a dumb fuck problem. There was no where near enough pushback on Bernie in this interview. His pie in the sky ideas would buckle the knees of this entire country and would change this world forever. Please do your research and get the other side of the story before you vote for your own demise. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.This moron is the reason trump is the president..splitting dems votesDamn, Bernie actually has an inside voice.. maybe he should use it more oftenSit every candidate for in a debate in a room full of cameras and a table like this podcast with a mediotor and no audience. And they can debate each other televised no audienceNow Bernie’s got me routing for him in the primary but I’m still going for DT in the generalShannon have dual citizenship and be able though run for senate that&#39;s insaneLooking forward to the Alien announcement on JRE 😂even 12 yrs is a conservative estimate on irreversible climate change which is a disastrous change leading to extinction of lifeNot a fan of Bernie politically, but I’m really glad Joe had him on. It’s great to see that these politicians are real people with opinions just like all of usThe Dems are right about corporations. The Republicans are right about the state. Bernie&#39;s solution is always legislation. Legislation is held in place by threat of force from whichever group happens to have a monopoly on violence in that particular area, the American Government in this case. I challenge anyone to name a piece of legislation that hasn&#39;t expanded the size of the Government and ,either ,created new problems that are worse than the original problem, or made the original problem worse. Everyone of this, albeit well intentioned, guy&#39;s solutions involve expanding the corrupt government. So how do we cripple the unethical corporations in an immediate way? Simple, you vote with your money every single day. But that takes research and discipline. It&#39;s easier to ask our daddy the Government to do it for us, which has disastrous consequences 100% of the time.All of the stuff he&#39;s talking about is simplistic and offering no actual way out.Bernie “full of shit” SandersGreat interview.   Joe Rogan at his best.for fuck sake Joe, Push back on his bull shit gun talk. Assult weapons are illegal, the AR-15 (ArmaLite ) is a SEMI AUTOMATIC rifle. Bernie says punish me a law abiding citizen for owning a weapon because some crazy (not me) takes a weapon and kills others. so why not Arm many so that if someone tries to kill someone, others will save them when the average 911 response time is 20-25 min.2 of my favorite white guys<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=52m19s">52:19</a>. &quot;&quot;classic Bernie air-quotes&quot;&quot;Medicare for all &quot;free&quot;Really nice that you had bernie on joe his ideas are still shit but very nice having him on.What? Deregulating a corporation, dosnt pollute the water... U cant poisen another persons property. The govt was allowing corporations to pollute public and resedial propertys in the 20th century. Bernie full of shit. He loves govt power so much not relizing its the source of the problemI can&#39;t stand that trump is up Israel&#39;s ass and I doubly can vote for Jew Jews have been destroying America is real has a wall around their country but the Jews here don&#39;t wanna build a wall weirdBernie Sanders is very reasonable.I literally never clicked on anything faster in my entire life.Rogan devolves into giving demented, psychopathic parasites a platform. What a shame.Nice try, Bernie. You&#39;re still not going to win because the type of people who watch JRE are the type of people who don&#39;t vote.Bernie 2020!!!No lie. This is seriously the best interview I’ve ever seen Bernie in. Super pleased with Joe for asking questions that matter to everyday people, questions that shed light on the egregious read and corruption in government, and questions that elucidate the socioeconomic conditions that perpetuate poverty and inequality plaguing urban cities.Wow im actually really surprised joe got bernie on.I like Joe but he did not ask one single hardball question. Like &quot;What about all the countries you mentioned having 75% effective tax rates, Bernie?&quot;Once you start taxing the big corporations they will just move they&#39;re  operating out of the US . And then the working people will be stuck with the bill and that&#39;s how the economy will collapse.  NY 15 dollars hour is not working people getting fired and businesses cutting hours and rising pricesWho TF downvotes this? Are these people simpletons? Russian trolls? <br /><br />Or is this just another example of America becoming so tribalist that it doesn’t matter what the other sides says?please have a podcast with airsoftfattyJoe Rogan for president 2020!LMFAO fuck you (((Joe Rogan)))It&#39;s sad to think a man who&#39;s 189 can still believe the bullshit that comes out of his mouth. Maybe at 190 years old he&#39;ll come back to reality.......Legalization, paying for student loans, making public colleges free for students, stopping wars and giving people healthcare. The rich, domestic and foreign super rich, that own huge chunks of the economy and the corporations involved, want to paint these ideas and the people that support them, from the &quot;left&quot; AND &quot;right&quot;, as badly and poorly as they can.Joe, thanks for the platform. I kind of went into this blind. Honestly I knew very little about Bernie not all of what he says is wacko but he didn’t do it for me. He’s a no go here.This man will never be president.Joe !!!! This Podcast FUCKING MADE IT BRO !!!!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=40m55s">40:55</a> “I don’t think they’re gonna have the FBI knocking on people’s doors and taking their guns, that’s not what we do in America” the FBI is knocking down people’s doors for a PLANT.  That is EXACTLY what we do in America.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m00s">27:00</a> if a high school degree not cut it, then maybe think to fix the public education system lol. Wtf?!Bernie is so desperate now he’s going on joe roganAn antidepressant ad ran when they were talking about drugsExactly how does the wealthy  people manipulate the politicians and who is involved? Just ask Bernie. Oh. He is not saying....., He knows but he aint tellin. Typical. Just another snow job.Bernie is fucking clueless.. esp on guns... and minimum wage 15$ ? yeah right ...Thank you Joe. Seriously. By giving light to these politicians and outlining the serious issues you are, I believe, transforming politics in the most positive way! You can be as humble as you need to be but really Joe, your an American hero. I really feel involved in the conversation and have gained more perspective on these issues than the news.Wow<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=28m12s">28:12</a> what about instead of free college for all, we revamp the education system as it is? Our cirriculums are sp fucking archaic and ass backwards today, the skills they try to teach kids have become absolutely obsolete given how exponentially technology is growing. Not everyone wants to go to college and the state shouldn&#39;t mandate everyone does, however it does mandate kids go through k-12 so why not focus on where the state already is and make the base education better first before college?Canadians come down to America to get major surgeries because they’d die waiting in CanadaGREAT SOFTBALL QUESTIONS JOE... 🤦‍♂️the obvious choice to beat trump. lets not fuck it up again america. biden cannot do what bernie can do<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=32m30s">32:30</a> - THE SOLUTION IS OBVIOUS &amp; HAS CONTINUED TO BE STOPPED &amp; HELD BACK IN GOVT BY THE CORRUPT BLOATED SKINBAG CORPSE MITCH MCCONNELL!! GUN CONTROL &amp; REGULATION. PERIOD.Andrew Yang, Brother West, than Bernie. Is Joe Rogan starting to love progressive ideas ?Bernie is the only person i will vote for over trump.So happy to finally see Bernie on here! Bernie/ Tulsi 2020!!!Greedy network corporations hubble up abunch of candidates to see who talks the loudest for 30 seconds while we have a bald ass elk hunter letting these same candidates speak with about the whole run time of a panel on news networksWhile I agree with Bernie on almost all of these issues, I don&#39;t believe he will be able to win the presidency with his attitude towards assault weapons, he needs to do better then a &quot;ban on all assault weapons&quot;. There are far to many people in this country that will vote against him for this reason, we need a solution that is better then this. Making it harder to get guns will be acceptable to some but I don&#39;t see anyone who is on the fence about supporting Bernie changing their minds while he is using the word ban.But a higher mandatory minimum wage would mean that big companies would be able to take the hit a lot better than small businesses. Not against it but just sayinI enjoyed this... It was nice to hear Bernie, casual and in depth. I believe that he thinks he knows whats best and thinks his ideas will work.... I simply think he&#39;s wrong.Get Trump on !He doesn&#39;t get into the nitty gritty of issues. &quot;They have all the power&quot;, bruh elaborate!!@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m10s">35:10</a> Burnie Lies about there being NO background checks from private sellers at gun shows known as the &quot;Gun show loophole&quot;<br />This is why the Main Stream Media and big Tech are trying to ban Steven Crowder, because he thoroughly debunked this Democrat LIE!<br />Here&#39;s the link to Crowders&#39; Gun show loophole video<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHsstZUcD94">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHsstZUcD94</a>So I busted my ass working and going to school. Got an affordable apartment the dorms were more expensive. Ate cheap food and budgeted for years in college. Paid most of my tuition, books,  etc in cash from working, and paid my 20k in student loans within two years of graduating. Is Bernie going to force the government to pay me all that money I had to pay for my loans, or just paying off the loans of people who said fuck it and racked up the loans without working for it ? There is a better way to do healthcare, education, and what not. However, nothing worth anything is free. Also, the 2nd amendment is to prevent the uprise of a tyrannical government...don’t touch my guns 😊Great podcast. Should have been 3 hours long. Now get Eddie Murphy on JRE.Joe Rogan to Bernie Sanders is your wife a UFO nutPLEASE BRING TRUMP&#39;Wealthiest country in the history of the world&#39;   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=53m35s">53:35</a> - let&#39;s test that.  If you have a friend that has $230,000 worth of credit card debt, owns no assets i..e. rents the sheets they sleep on and brings home $40,000 per year would you consider that person wealthy?   The USA currently  $23 trillion in debt and rising bringing in $4 trillion a year.  I greatly applaud  Joe&#39;s efforts to try to get some specificity from any politician.  Almost impossible as politicians have NO desire to do root cause analysis of what is driving a given problem..  Politics -(regardless of party) is where the people who want the least amount of accountability for their job go to get a paycheck.  Keep trying Joe, maybe you will get someone who actually can articulate a deep understanding of even one problem and I will keep watching every show to witness that very rare event.If healthcare is a human right, and healthcare is provided by other people, you are simply saying, these people must treat you. Last time I recall when some one is coerced into doing something they don’t want to do, it was called slavery. By making healthcare a right, you will enslave doctors and cripple the best healthcare providers in the entire world.I am feeling the burn but where is the jamie, check that!?So...Trump next?I won’t vote for him but super interesting. Probably go with Biden at this pointPoor ole Bernie - just starting to sound desperate now..Hey, friendly reminder that healthcare and college isn’t “free”.<br />Higher income taxes will only hurt everyone.Hate how this is so short! &amp; Joe is incredible! But we all know he could really go into more questions on so much of what Bernie said! Yet he chooses to be lite. Its okay though Joe we know what you&#39;re doing! Hopefully next time!“<br />We have more criminals in jail than communist countries... yeah bc they punish their criminals more severely and practice capital punishmentHahaha the last question was gold.Love this interview with Bernie. How can people have a negative view of Bernie. He’s legit fighting for everyday working people. He has my vote and I donated!Option, sorry bad signal.Bernie has my vote!👍🇺🇸Bernie is a fucking idiotFor gods sake, Bernie please take your pills 💊 “pills are gooood”🤪2 Democratic candidates?Wants long form debates. Does one of JRE’s shortest castsDidn&#39;t pay for public school? Lol, he is either lying or too lost in his own bs to realize how wrong he is30 minutes in. Does Bernie ever once bring up concrete numbers? These are major proposals. Where are the numbers? You can&#39;t make such grand promises without explaining how you&#39;re going to pay for them.I was hoping for a deep philosophical discussion, but no rebuttals from Joe  😕Do most americans really not realize that all of their politicians except a few like Bernie are just puppets controlled by big money?Get Richard Wolff on next!The US has more incarcerated people than communist China?10/10 podcastMuch respect to Joe for hosting Bernie and giving different people a fair shotBernie is trying to implement a gun policy knowing nothing about guns.  Bernie let me explain that military rifles are different than civilian rifles by law.  A military rifle will often have have a full auto mode where you pull the trigger a the rifle will shoot multiple rounds.  A civilian rifle is illegal to have a full auto mode, and only allowed to have a semi auto.  One round for each pull of a trigger.  Hunting rifles are often semi auto.  The ammunition used by hunting rifles is often the same.  So basically a hunting rifle and a civilian assault rifle are the same except the civilian version will often look like the military version, even though it does not operate like one by law.  So you want to ban it because the way it looks?Bernie Sanders:  Presidential candidates should have several hours, commercial free to explain their positions<br />Also Bernie:  only does one hour on RoganGod bless the gun showIt&#39;s nice that Joe had Bernie on. However, Bernie is a commie bastard.Great questions Joe!Bernie 2020Is there a public.Joe, if you have the chance, tell Bernie he is a genius.  Tax stock trades and directly funnel the proceeds directly into education for all American Citizens.  What an excellent idea.Background checks already existTrump won not because he didn’t have to run against a serious candidate.Yang sanders collab admin??Tried to get in before the cuckservatives started spamming SoCiAliSt. Too lateYou&#39;re killin it, Joe. Most relevant media in America. Maybe if you were both crying while putting lipstick on each other&#39;s assholes with dubstep blaring in the background, it could make the trending tab. Call it a &quot;Minecraft Challenge&quot; or some shit. I don&#39;t know how the world works anymore.Thank you for making this podcast happenGuns only for hunting. Here in Europe to have a gun for hunting you have to pass a test like knowing the birds the seasons wen you can hunt them an so on, if you don’t pass the test you don’t deserve to have a license to have a gun. If you want to do shooting you only have access to .22 caliber and you have to be in a sport club to have license and use it. And in the transport the gun have to be in a special case locked.He almost sounds logical fair and compassionate.Yang 2020Mitch McConnell raise the minimum wage in Kentucky. Now✊✊✊Would have loved to see him debate Milton FriedmanComplain endlessly about people that have and how they obviously stole it from the have nots 🙄 summed it up for youSocialism, the gateway drug to communism.<a href="https://youtu.be/mHkLDX8uoCI">https://youtu.be/mHkLDX8uoCI</a>I’m not a Bernie fan, but I can say it was really good to see him a forum like this.  I’d love it if Joe could get all of the candidates on and let this kind of natural conversation happen.  I think it would do a world of good for them, rather than giving us the circus of the debates.OMG!!! SO MUCH TRUTH MY HEADS GOING TO EXPLODE!!!! Thank You Mr. Rogan for having Bernie Sanders on the podcast. By far the best political podcast I have ever seen!!!! I&#39;m feelin the BERN BIGTIME Now!!!! I LOVE IT!!!Love joe rogan... Wished Joe asked Bernie about &quot;social justice&quot; communism (although he did refer to Chinese communism and authoritarianism with disdain) etc. I want to see bernies position on extreme and dangerous extreme left/left wing radicalism/terrorism... The Danger of this communist identitarian faction, their growing number, and the historical danger set by stalin and mao, in what even today is communist dictatorship etc...... I want to see how bernie deals with it.GET MITCH MCCONNEL ON THE SHOW!The assault weapons ban was bullshit Bernie , here’s a solution to the problem, Family, and education. Promote and reimburse people for it and the country will change overnight .Why do I feel like this podcast is going to go down in history as a huge media turning point?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=55m30s">55:30</a> Bernie: when we...<br />All black people: FUUUCCKKKKone question i have is, what stops these politicians from taking their money, and just not doing what they wanted?This and the Elon Musk ones are pretty much historic...Joe give him some water!Have Trump on.BERNIE BERNIE BERNIE. THE ONLY MAN THAT CAN SAVE THE USA. I wish I was American to vote him ❤️❤️❤️Lets raise minimum wage and give free health care and school for all so lazy stagnant pieces of shit can live off tax payer dollars while they wash windows at subway... fuck off with this bullshitGod bless those gunsI would rather be free with crime and dangerBernie may finally be worth a million bucks but he still buys his shirts off the rack. 👍👍😁😁🙌✌️❤️<br />Bernie is the man, he got so screwed last time, and had 2 choices... Walk away, or concede knowing he will be allowed a platform to come back harder next cycle. If he complained, he&#39;d never be able to run again.Jesus joe, throwing softballs much? Being respectful is one thing but taxing amazon doesnt pay for trillion dollar spending plans... you know better.Shoulda done 3 hours! Let’s go bernie<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m24s">0:24</a> Shoutouts to Andrew Yang for saying this first and DURING THE DEBATE. Bernie should have given credit here, it&#39;s a bad look.Lazy fucks make less money therefore can&#39;t afford healthcare.  Nuff said, apply yourself. Don&#39;t be a lazy fuck and expect things to be handed to you. Already do severe background checks on gun sale. He doesn&#39;t even know what and &quot;assault wepon&quot; is . Yea take our guns so we can&#39;t kill those psychos shooting people. Uneducated....Our Mental Health system is quick to prescribe...very little talk therapy out here or cooping skills being taught.  Here a pill...have a great day.  That pill becomes their cooping skill.Damn what i would have paid to have this be a trifecta with Alex Jones on the cast.Bernie says health care is a human right. No it&#39;s not. That idea equates to indentured servitude of the few who posses the skills to provide health care. Forcing a Doctor provide health services to all is a form of slavery enforced by the government. Period.Your for Bernie or not, I think we can all agree, a format like this for a candidate is the best.  So bull that corporate msm control the debates, so instead of giving a thorough thoughtful honest answer, they have to scream and shout and make their 30 second answer sound bite worthy.  I think we can all agree we need more forum like this and less corporate debate control.If you can&#39;t stand fake news and can&#39;t stand the bullshit propaganda from every single t.v. network then spread this info to anybody you can. If you tired of hearing or watching short spirts of info that explain absolutly Fucking nothing for hours and days and weeks and months on end then spread this info. This is how a candidate is suppose to explain everything he can do for our country. FUCK THE DEBATES. If you have already made up your mind on who  you are voting for just by simply watching the DEBATES, then you are A FUCKING IDIOT. If anything every single candidate should get on this PODCAST to want to explain  there case that way the American people can be fully informed on which candidate is good for the country.  HAVING 1 CANDIDATE on this PODCAST A DAY IS MORE THAN ENOUGH THAN CHEESY COMERCIALS AND UN-REALISTIC DEBATES. IF IT TAKES A WEEK OR EVEN A MONTH IT&#39;LL GIVES US THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A CLEARER VIEW ON WHO WE SHOULD VOTE FOR. Spread this to everybody you know even if they don&#39;t care, send it to them anyways. Emails, instagram, facebook, twitter, whatever just spread this info.Joe&#39;s drinking the koolaid. Bernie is seemingly honest  but he&#39;s completely disingenuous about the cost of his policies. You can tax the top 50% and it will still not pay for free healthcare, college etc. Bernie&#39;s a bullshitter. Not to mention, why should fucking McDonald&#39;s be forced to subsidize retards! If your an adult trying to manage a family at McDonald&#39;s, you are a fucking invalid, THAT IS NOT MCDONALD&#39;S FUCKING PROBLEM! Furthermore, if you are dumb enough to take on a worthless student loan, why should tax payers be responsible...stop telling kids  AFROM K-12 &quot;YOU HAVE TO GO TO COLLEGE&quot;JRE Jan 2021<br />Joe: So...?<br />Bernie: Affimative<br /><br />End of podcastI like himI disagree with pretty much everything Bernie stands for but I appreciate this long form, reasonable discourse. Good ep, Joe.Bernie sounds like a “good” guy, but either he’s a professional lier or very naive. The 1% have all this money because the central banks created it, and unlike regular “Joe”, this Rich guys  skill is attracting money, so naturally the money goes to the hands of this clever financial experts.<br />Then they have the wealth, but Sanders is wrong about the power, they don’t have the power, the government has gained power trying to control healthcare, education, everything, and the 1% has the money to buy the power from the government, if government didn’t try to control everything, there is no power to buy, so lobbyists are useless in that case. and there isn’t any power to buy.12 yrs and we’re doomed cuz of climate change?  I thought we were supposed to be doomed from it when I was in elementary school 20 yrs ago.Diseases of despair?? Doctors are Gaslighting Infections that progress to organ failure etc.? And it get worse? Lol Bernie is such a gaslighting shill lol rofl, it&#39;s like a movie so bad it&#39;s good, a liar so bad and full of shit it&#39;s hilarious, rofl serious who dies he work for corrupt healthcare, billionaire hegelian dialect, treasonous secret societies idk this is funny though, Trump is amazing, these clowns were all that were present before him Rofl go Trump lol, he&#39;d be laughing his ass off of he saw this?Get Trump on3%,Joe ask him how much he’s worth,a lot more than 90% of us,ask him free healthcare for illegals ?Compare this to the shit show that is the mainstream media. The difference is night and dayJOE!<br /><br /> FUCK THE DEBATES! <br /><br />KEEP DOING THIS!Great podcast. Just goes to show how cool Joe is that he can talk to all sorts of people from crazy ass Eddie Bravo when they just effin around to having meaningful and educational characters Neil Degrasse Tyson to giving a huge platform for presidential candidates to speak their mind without interrupting them every 5 seconds. GREAT JOB!Joe is the man! <br />Even though I don&#39;t like The Bernie Burner, I think its great that Joe is having these types of folks on to speak. <br />America needs to hear both sides.I&#39;m pretty conservative, but I tip my hat to Joe Hogan for this podcastSo many ❄️ conservatives disliking the video and can’t even watch it 😂the ONE TIME eddie bravo doesn&#39;t randomly show up...Bernie did a pretty good job explaining his shitty ideas. Sounds so good until math....Bernie is a fake and an idiotBernie’s the only president I trust! He’s the only one I think will actually fight the big corporations so we can have health care and fight climate change! We don’t have a lot of time left to combat climate change either! The clock is ticking!Tax the Rich and do the Best we can do.It would be better if he had on mainstream candidates on both right and left for their individual episodes. Then a more debate format across right and left. Because ultimately that&#39;s what matters. Not just expanding on the ideas that Joe personally finds interesting.This made me smileUC tuition: in state 11k. Out of state 23.5 k. That’s not including books room and board.  Much more than when my dumb fuck dad was available to go to college. It was free for him now he wonders why we can’t pay for it. Lmao.You should have Ben Shapiro or someone equally educated to give the other side of the story. No hard data makes all of his crazy socialistic plans sound good.I love you Bernie. You and Tulsi. It’s you and Tulsi, or the apocalypse and cannibalism. <br /><br />You are our only chance. Please win.Hope you make it Bernie, plz keep this man safe.. Greetings from EuropeThe MSM is never going to support Sanders with his policies. Taxing the rich and supporting programs for equality will only cut into their bottom line. It&#39;s a shame his common sense policies will probably never see the light of day with lobbied obstructionists in the senate.44% of college graduate are under employed in jobs that do not require a degree..... So free school without first figuring out the jobs thing, and new industries.... Seems kind of like a bad idea<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m40s">35:40</a> , false, those are straw purchases and are illegal.For being a Jew, Bernie is pretty retarded on how raising minimum wage will only force the companies to raise their prices and then the consumers are the ones paying the billWtfif he is not the next president , the world really is going to the shithouse ...After 9/11 we gave up our rights and now after mass shootings the government wants more of our rights. My boy Bennjy Franklin once said any1 who gives up freedom for safety dont deserve freedom at all.Hey Bernie. Want to see a country where owning a gun is illegal? My home country of Mexico. Now only the crooked cops and the gangsters have guns and decent people can&#39;t protect themselves.<br /><br />By the way, what Bernie is talking about, keeping guns out of the hands of &#39;criminals&#39;... if your ex wife lies about you, you lose your ability to protect yourself. If the police lie about you. No more protecting yourself. If a neighbor wants to steal from you, they file a false police report, no more protecting yourself....Fuck Bernie Sanders this the guy who praised Communist dictators who commit democide(&quot;the intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by government agents acting in their authoritative capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command &quot;.)against their people. Plus he has said himself that bread lines are goods. I&#39;m not falling for the cult of personality and ad hominems. I don&#39;t want socialism the term democrat socialism came from Vladimir Lenin to sell Communism. And Bernie doesn&#39;t speak for me on the 2nd amendment any change to the U.S. Constitution is illegal Title 18, U.S.C., Section 242 - Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law <br />This statute makes it a crime for any person acting under color of law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom to willfully deprive or cause to be deprived from any person those rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution and laws of the U.S. The criminals and the cartels will not give two shits about your gun control laws.Bernie&quot;Somebody else&#39;s money&quot; SandersI never doubted him being genuine. I just know socialism is stupid and would never vote for himEliminating all fossil fuels from the world, will do wonders for the stability in the notoriously stable middle east.Ron Paul was right and Bernie Sanders is wrong.I swear to God if he could I bet Joe Rogan would bring the ghost of JFK on his podcast. This man can bring anyoneJoe sure throws a mean softball...Fuck the old socialist piece of shit@berniesanders the OG with these humanist ideas.  America thought it was BROKE and couldn&#39;t afford anything for the people....  Then Bernie2016 came and blew the cap off that shit!  Now everyone, EVERYONE is talking about the ideas that he brought forth.  Bern baby Bern!!!All of you love that he can get a platform to speak on - he has an obligation to call out Bernie’s rhetoric. He should’ve been prepared- letting Bernie sit there and spew spin and rhetoric doesn’t help any voter. Questioning his ideas - digging deeper underneath the surface is a beneficial interview. This was nothing more than a political platform for Bernie to stand onBernie Sanders!!!!!!He has no chance.If these people honestly believe the U.S. is the greatest country on earth, surely they can get medicare for all. If all of these &quot;lesser&quot; countries can do it, surely... THE GREATEST COUNTRY CAN. <b>&quot;great, huge, surround be huge water... ocean water&quot;</b>Bernie: thank God cops (good guys with guns) were there to end dayton shooting quickly.....<br />Yet wants stricter background checks for law abiding citizens who could of just as well stopped the shooter. Criminals don&#39;t care about background checks. Chicago just had 40 shot dead in a gun free area. Start talking about banning all sales of fentinal and opioids which kills more Americans per year than guns Bernie Sanders an you have my vote sir.Bernie saying “I talked to a young woman the other night” blah blah... it is so fake.<br /><br />Hey Bernie, you are talking to a cool dude that just wants to have a real conversation...Bernie is ok. He may win.. but I&#39;m for Yang.I feel like joe just did his first interview, Bernie is such a fuckin SCHMUCK that joe couldn&#39;t even have a conversation like his normal show, he literally had to interview this fuckin loser. So ashamed hes from my state.Love ya BernieOkay so he’s gotta win... I need to know them Alien secrets.A. His healthcare ideas comes with greatly increase taxes.<br />B. Countries with socialized medicine have significantly worse medical service and higher death rates in hospitals.<br />C. Bernie’s heart is in the right place but the consequences of this idea is what his non-supporters fear.Welp, this guy has my vote!Love all the brain washed Fox News dummies coming here with their bad faith arguments and tired, false talking points.I need some of that &quot;magic solution&quot;Waaaa!!!Nowhere near long enough should’ve been 2 and half hours minimum<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m32s">47:32</a> BUY OUR MARINARAWhy just 1 hour?It&#39;s interesting that Bernie points out how bought off the government is.  He even sights how he refused to vote for most legislation because it was handwritten by the oligarchs. YET, Bernie&#39;s solutions to all of these major problems is to give more control and money to government and disarm citizens to boot.Now the tangerine turd please joe.Raising min to 15 is too high. It will only make larger Corporations bigger since they only ones who can afford. Raising to 10 is far more reasonable. And it will allow a quicker implementation.This episode is brought to you by : The Democratic PartyThe only way to really get to know a candidate.. glad Bernie took time to do this, 1 hr was still too short.I’m in the Yang Gang, but Bernie is a very close second option for me. He and President Obama inspired me to be an engaged citizen.Bernie talked to A LOT of women last night!Wah wah wah wah waaaaahhhhhKanye?Well Bernie there is always going to be those kind of &quot;brave&quot; people unfortunately....Lmao Bernie Sanders supports children being physically mutilated based off delusions. He doesn&#39;t get to use children too push his narrative. Notice how he mentioned that it was a Republican AG who reversed the unconstitutional gun ban. Yet didn&#39;t mention that gun related statistics were more or less not effected by doing such. See, scum liberals like to use &quot;military&quot; grade rifles. As a talking point about why guns need to be banned. And why, when white men do it the whole of us are racist. Yet they NEVER bring up the astronomical gun related homicides. Committed by minorities, too minorities and everyone else. In their liberally ran cities with the stricest gun control in the country. Statistics tell the entire story. You got a problem with gun violence. Ho after minority communities. You won&#39;t, because you rely on appeasing their victim mentality to get votes.Wow great conversationWhat a fantastic podcast. Thanks for getting Bernie on the show Joe<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m16s">23:16</a> <br />Joe: &quot;why is that legal?&quot;<br />Bernie: &quot;JOE IT IS LEGAL BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS!&quot;<br />Joe: &quot;right 😐&quot;This guy is forcing government on people in the first 5 minutes he’s talking... Jesus Christ....so when are you interviewing Trump?Who gave those jobs to China Bernie?  Congress?  How long have you been in Congress.  You the Clintons..NAFTA..tpp... you are a fucking joke.  Stop funding  for Israel.  Term limits.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=17m20s">17:20</a> - The market controls cost Bernie. If people dont want the dept they choose a different school. If enough people dont go to a school that school will either lower its rates or shut down. Everyone is not entitled to the same thing.America’s already in debt Bernie- give free shit to everyone without working. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23maga">#maga</a>if JRE took over the presidential debates, we would all have a clear idea on who these people really are.AN AR-15 IS A SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPON NOT A  ASSAULT WEAPON! Bernie your an idiot Trump is real deal!A quick trip to Waterland I mean Greenland should convince themGet kamala harris onJoe you are the 🐐🐐🐐🐐Very cool of Bernie to do this.When Bernie takes office I would love to prosecute all these corporate so called news anchors (Maddow, Hannity) for pushing false narritives and needlessly sending our children to die halfway across the country only to protect mega corporations, like our troops are some mercenary squad only here to serve the wealthy... <br />it&#39;s disgusting, we really do need Bernie Sanders to bring US back to realityThat&#39;s exactly what you are going to do Bernie,  leave the oil riggers and coal miners in the cold...A person that wants to make a change doesn&#39;t sit around finding people to blame. A person with character takes ownership of their lives and their shortcomings.<br /><br />Joe does great interviews. But Bernie needs a punch in the gut.I clicked on this shit so fastIf I hate Bernie but I&#39;m glad about having him on, do I dislike or like the video? Kinda torn here 😅UFO announcement from the president on THE podcast??? &#39;Merica ! LolMore people are killed by hammers and clubs than by &quot;Assault Weapons&quot;.  More people are killed by the use of hands and feet, than by &quot;Assault Weapons&quot;.  Only about 3% of homicides are committed with rifles of any kind, with &quot;Assault Rifles&quot; being an even smaller subset of that number.  That makes you wonder why so many are calling for them to be taken from us.TRUMP 2020I was a YUGE Bernie fan in 2015 and when the DNC screwed him over I ended up voting for Trump. Listening to him talk feels nostalgic. I honestly love this guy, not for his policies, but his passion. Too bad he’ll never make it to the White House.An al·go·rithm that red flags personal attacks or name calling on social media as well as a person who dominates, incites arguments or bullies other commentators. Green light those commentators that add to the conversation in a manner that invites solutions &amp; inclusiveness.Before I dive in to this, I&#39;m sure the comment section will be reasonable, sane, and well thought out.Would never vote for this man but every candidate should do jreAssault weapons, assault weapons, assault weapons.  I want to agree with you, I really do.  I think big pharma and wall street have way too much power, but you keep spouting off this bullshit about firearms and I just CANNOT vote for you.  You don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about, therefore, you&#39;re not qualified to make legislation about it.Yeah crush the private insurance cabal ! And regulate the profits of the pharmaceutical companies health care would be solved with those two steps we need an elected federal health care insurance regulatory commission and nationalize it and let it be non profit .<br />We also need term limits where you won’t have career politicians, and end superpacs and lobbying .... it’s really simple to fix our government .<br />We have to get rid of the crooks and the incentive for politics  be a money grab . It should be a donation of one’s own time for the betterment of there country and only be able to be done by someone who could live there life responsibly enough to donate 4 years of there life without making income. <br />I like what Bernie says but after 2016 I’m certain he is just in there to get more money on his way out the door , he should of destroyed the Democratic Party after how they cheated him openly and then Russia baited for last 2 and a half years while using the intel and federal police to spy and harass a elected president and try a obstruction scheme , if American people from both party’s aren’t disgusted by losing 3/4 of the term of a elected president due to the un elected officials stone walling and legally harassing them ... of course they killed Kennedy in front of our faces , they shot and wounded Regan so he played ball,  they got Nixon same way there trying to get Trump, but there sellout CIA assets Bush sr., Clinton, Bush W , Obama ... they had a free ride to allow the sellout of our country and weakening of our military with the complete unregulated military industrial complex.<br />Remember they had to admit the pentagon couldn’t account for 6 trillion dollars then the next morning was sept 11th 2001 ,,,<br />This is a big party going on at the top and the fact that there has been Bernie whos been senators longer than I’ve been alive and he hasn’t been against them but only when he knows it won’t tip the boat and never actually apply any change, he is pimping to the poor and middle class talking “how bout we worry about you guys having a extra couple grand a year “<br />This country needs real change from top down and this simple minded hey make life a lil easier for the poorest as we slide over the edge of no return, this country will end up just like the rest of South America as if it’s the plan with the population replacement that’s been happened the last 3 decades and even voted against can’t be stopped , <br />The poor black American population is being attacked so heavily by the leftist corporate democratic and corporate republican party’s open invasion,replacement,incarceration,abortion, and poverty increases ... the black led democratic leadership in every area of the country are literally selling out there own people . <br />That Cornell west guy who was on the podcast literally mentioned race in every sentence he spoke to where I and others raking with me thought it was a joke , have never listened to the guy but I believe he is to focused on race baiting and playing it up no different than al sharpton,are Jessie Jackson, ... it’s amazing they never talk about are have any answers of how to fix the actual real problems within the black American population.<br />So far Kim kardashian asking trump to release prisoners and reform prison system has gotten more done for the black community than literally any of the others in last decade ...<br />I’m tired of the dividers who are only in it for self enrichment it’s time to start making it uncomfortable for them people , they should be screamed at and told who they are to there face every second they leave there houses. That goes for almost every cable news employee, race pimps, senators , and congressmen , they should be scared to cross the American people for there own greed.I knew Joe would ask him about aliens. It just took longer than I thought it would.I think he may have forgotten to remove the coat hanger from his shirt... 👘 😲This was clearly setup. Joe was paid a lot of money to ask these specific questions. Hopefully nobody buys any of this nonsense.I’m wait for Joe to say, “this all kind of reminds me of my experience with DMT.”Currently I make $15 an hour working as a janitor and I plan to trade stocks full time soon. Bernie’s plan is to make my climb to $15 an hour over 6 years, worthless, and make trading far less profitable. That right there really builds up my incentive to work!Minimum wage the move people make in America the more they spend. It&#39;s a circle business if good business will sell more to make moreJoe ask him who will pay for it,how much will it cost,can I keep my doctor or do I have to go to a Government doctor.Bernie Sanders = America’s Dad.Badass. I was wondering when this would happen.I used to be on the fence, but after this interview, I am beginning to really like Bernie! The dude is eloquent, smart, thoughtful, and just seems like a very nice person that wants to change America for the better. I don&#39;t normally vote Democrat, but he has my vote in this primary!Bernies campaign staff complained because they wanted 15 $ an hour and he was like shittt, and gave it to them but cut their hours proportionately. He couldn&#39;t defend that policy at all...Breadline Bernie is a political hack. He has been his entire career. Fuck socialism. Fuck Bernie. Fuck you if you don&#39;t like it.No.StrangeWhat Bernie Sanders and his supporters don&#39;t realizeis the government created the problems that we see today and the only by removal of government from the equation can the problems be fixed.<br /><br />Just look at government-backed student loans and Medicare and Medicaid. College tuition and healthcare costs were low before government intervened. When government intervenes it only creates the problem it&#39;s supposed to be there to fix.its great to hear ideas unfiltered, but my god how about a LITTLE pushback. for example: How will you pay for everything?😴... He gots my vote.Look I’m a conservative and I did enjoyed this podcast. But what is the best vehicle that’s gonna get free healthcare? We have a bad taste in our mouths dude to Obamacare. Also lobbying should be illegal.Joe jitzu 101The Burn Man. Wow!I’m conservative but I like and agree with what some Bernie is saying. I’m more open to hear what he has to say. <br /><br />I think this interview being a environment that doesn’t have every other statement talking down about Trump makes it easier to watch and tolerate.Whoooooo!!Bernie 2020!!! Trumps a whiny little bitchOh boy this guy is off his rocking chairBernie let me down with the assault weapons..Can some one please explain to me how raising the minimum wage to $15 will effect me when I currently make $20. Will I see no benefit from the cost of living increase? What happens if prices all of a sudden double to accommodate the higher wages. How will I be able to afford groceries if all the prices increase but my pay doesn’t increase. Do I essentially have to take one for the team? I have worked for almost 10 years since I was 15. Worked my way up from $5 an hour at a summer job. I am currently going to school for a trade. I don’t have any school debt because I am managing my money and time. I agree with the large drug companies and schools being greedy but raising the minimum wage is stopping me from voting for any democratic nominee. I don’t want to be financially ruined because every one but me gets a massive pay increase causing me to go bust and make the last ten years worthless. Also on a side note I don’t believe in gun control I would rather like to see an educational class and vetting process before some one can buy a gun. Similarly to how you would get a conceal carry permit. That would dissuade many wackos and all law abiding citizens would be better educated which is always good.I wont even give this pr prison , pro war, antimale dipshit a watch, just a thumbs down.Fuck all politicians, they are all lying pieces of shit. They are the problem. There is no solution in politics. Only political gain for profit as the ultimate goal. Fuck this old fart.Bernie is coocoo for coco puffs,  but here&#39;s an idea mr. Free healthcare.  Maybe instead of changing the healthcare system in what meds cost and doctors visits cost.... since healthcare is NOT a right and you can&#39;t MAKE doctors treat people,  just offer free medical school.  Flood the market with doctors and competition.  Then remove the drug company patents or lower them to less years and pop up some more drug companies and make cheaper drugs.  The money is still there for insurance companies and incentives still there for doctors.  More competition = less demand = lower cost.This is the guy! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23feelthebern">#feelthebern</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23crapitalism">#crapitalism</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernietulsi2020">#bernietulsi2020</a>Joe Rogan is expanding his podcast so much. Comparing his first videos at his home with his pals from 6 years ago. And now, what an accomplishment!! Every year his show expands further in all aspects. Great job Joe!6 minutes in and Bernie has already lied about HealthCareI think everyone would love if more politicians came on the show and actually discuss in-depth their plans for America.Sorry burnie. There is literally no advantage an ar 15 in a mass shooting. Pistols and rifles shoot at the same speed — the right ones. Also, you ban assault rifles. Crazy people use illegally made and obtained ones. Why is this so hard??????Who&#39;s disliking this video?<br /><br />I&#39;m willing to bet it&#39;s gun nuts.I donated 20 bucks to Bernies campaign 4 times already and could only do that much... But I believe in him that much, I AM the person he is fighting for. No medical coverage, working 40 hard labor hours and can barely cover basics if that, go to sleep hungry more often than not... He IS the real deal!!&quot;Myth is that I love dictatorship&quot; Dude u went to Soviet Union at the brink of its collapse, was shown beautiful facade went back and started telling people how awesome communism is. cmon thats not even seriousHow many houses did he buy againg with his &quot;huge piles of money&quot;? Hes a politician, why is he so rich?Bernie “you’re taking us to a whole new area” sandersMost if not all of Bernie&#39;s proposals are very feasible to the American people. The US will be saving over 5 trillion dollars over a ten-year span under a single-payer healthcare system. In particular,  the average American will be saving hundreds if not thousands of dollars annually paying for healthcare as Medicare-For-All will eliminate premiums and deductibles. Furthermore, these systems would be mostly supplemented by securities transactions at a rate of 0.02 percent (your average exchanges in stocks and bonds) and a 6.7 percent employer payroll tax. As for free college, his theories on how to tackle the payment would be matching what he claims in this video, specific taxes on Wall Street speculation which would lead to some lucrative returns, coming in the form of a 0.5 percent tax on hedge funds, stock trades and more, all the way down to 0.005 percent fee on derivatives. These minuscule numbers would result in a system that moves billions of dollars into the federal treasury. The wealth of 1,000 of the top billionaires is equal to 3.5 billion of the poorest individuals. I implore you to look into the wretched actions taken by Wall Street and big banks against the people of the United States, they are despicable in so many conceivable ways and own a majority of the property in the United States. ALL of these policies are being introduced or have been established for decades in almost every Western nation, and we have the audacity to call these ideas radical.I&#39;m sorry Bernie but i don&#39;t give a shit about rich college kids being in debt. How you are going to help hard working poor people. Fuck the middle and upper class.Bernie loves to waste everyones money but his ownBOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!  you missed your chance Bernie, you should have gone on JRE before you sold us all down the river and didn&#39;t call out the election fraud that allowed Hillary to be the nominee...Canada spent half of what the USA spent on health care.  sounds good till you do the math.  Canada has 37m people, USA has 372m people  10x more people in the USA than Canada.  if we did the same universal health care like they do in Canada we would be spending 5x more than we currently do.  spending 5x more than we currently do sounds freaking stupid right?Bernie is a joke and will never be President. Take your socialism and get the Fuck outta hereI&#39;d love for the Bern to win, but money abysmally owns politians, so the DNC will almost certainly fuck over Bern again. I&#39;m sticking with my conscience though, and voting for him.Education gets enough $ from the taxpayers, it’s the do nothing administrators that suck up all the money and fuck over the teachers and students.I&#39;d be curious to see if any of the major republican candidates would be up for coming onto this show, because given his open mindedness I can almost guarantee that if one of them wanted to Joe would have them. Let&#39;s get candidates to speak their mind, either to change our minds or to give them enough rope to hang themselves.You are actually genuine, I think Bernie is not as nuanced as I’d like but HE is go Genuine. <br /><br />Like the price of insulin is different in each state and area.<br /><br />Lower military spending, and you will have to raise taxes<br /><br />Don’t ban private insurance<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a>Well now you NEED to interview the other party candidates. BE THE MAKESHIFT PLATFORM WE NEEDNot a fan of Bernie but glad Joe had him on.Send Bernie 27 bucks ...... its  the average donation of a Bernie voterI really like Bernie, but I don&#39;t understand why he&#39;s been coming down in the polls. I think he was level with Warren last I looked.As a rail roader Bernie needs to give me a better promise than we won&#39;t leave you behind.I agree with the regulation of the drug companys but when he was asked questions on HOW to actually resolve the issues he had no other solution other then &quot;Rally the American people &amp; complain&quot;. All he&#39;s doing is pushing the complaining nerve of the american people but he will never get anything accomplished. His stance on college, the minimum wage &amp; bailing out students and doubling down on a broken college system that doesn&#39;t work anymore made me cringe &amp; is a first class ticket to collapsing the economy &amp; financial markets for good. AND YOU WANT ME TO PAY MORE TAX ON TOP OF THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX WE ALREADY PAY FOR TRADING EQUITIES?!?!?! Bro I really gave him a chance with open ears &amp; mind on the podcast but he is %100 not fit to be president. SORRY GUYSFor all you morons who don’t know the history of the United States and how labor was treated before the government regulated it...<br />Kids worked (only poor kids of course) many died in the conditions. There wasn’t a weekend, you like those weekend deer hunts and drunken nights, none of that....<br /><br />You all like police, libraries, firefighters? Those are socialist programs. <br /><br />A 40hr work week? <br /><br />Just look back and realize, people are living off starvation wages while the government (through our tax dollars) supplement the starvation wages because there is not a living wage. It was decided when they put the min wage in that it was for people to be able to work any job in the country for 40hrs a week and live off of it. <br /><br />Maybe, just maybe...you morons haven’t done shit worth of research. <br /><br />But, sure, let’s use old Red Scare tactics, it’s how we fucking got here in the first place where they’ve brainfucked you into thinking that regulation on mob bosses will lead to less freedom for the regular citizen. <br /><br />Having a strong feeling against a person due to your own lack of education is just a sign that the propaganda has gotten to you fools and you’re not thinking for yourselves but like sheep.<b>Joe hello Bernie Rogan</b>Holy shit what a surprise jre has come a long waysShould make a law when turning 18 you get a gun &amp; an oxy prescriptionThis guy is absolutely passionate and devoted to helping Americans. And has been consistent for decades. He needs to be our next president.7 mins and I’m done this shits so boring Gd.With I the first 4 minutes. Pass legislation to force tv companies to give free air time. This guy has a one track mind , every free. 🤣I take care of mine,work hard defend what&#39;s yoursWho he get red over ufo questionJoe, as a proud republican, you did America a great service by allowing a candidate to speak from his position in a way that no other media outlet has done in years. thank you sir. I may disagree with some of Senator Sanders policies, but i do appreciate his honest efforts. Joe please continue to be an example for the rest of the media world.Bernie&#39;s gonna let us clap them alien cheeks, he&#39;s my president!<b>DO NOT LOOK UP!!</b> Justina Pelletier, Maryanne Godboldo, Rebecca Riley r.i.p. passed at only 2 years old on psychiatric drugs, <b>DO NOT LOOK UP, DO NOT TELL FRIENDS AND FAMILY!!!!</b> vote Bernie and Andrew Yang, Vermont is smart and loves the US sending this guy <b>DO NOT LOOK UP MENTAL HEALTHCARE BANKRUPTING YOUR TAX DOLLARS</b>  not a Trojan HorseThe American people are getting sick and tired of hearing of your damn emailsJOE ROGAN just hit the f*ing STRATOSPHERE with this one! Hell yea Joe Rogan! You&#39;re truly the best platform for real people to speak on their issues and their actual view points. Only you could get Bernie Sanders. And im a Trump supporter, but was a Bernie supporter before Hillary used her political power to rule him out.Here&#39;s how you explain health care quickly: Emergency medical bills is the number one reason for the bankruptcy of families. Combining buying power leverages large numbers of people to lower cost ; this is what insurance is. Now imagine leveraging the buying power of the entire country, that&#39;s what the ama was. Now for all you right wingers tired of people &quot;getting a free ride&quot; well that&#39;s what the mandate solved. Also for you right wingers, you&#39;re going to get taxed, don&#39;t you want something to show for it at least? Then support anything that&#39;ll get us toward universal health. It&#39;s supported by health care workers and fought against by insurance companies. Which side do you trust? Follow the money and you&#39;ll see republican politicians are funded by these same insurance companies. Do the math.<br />Pretty sure that&#39;s under 45 seconds.Release the hounds!!!!!!!I like this man. He is out there fighting and campaigning for 99%. Keep going Bernie, you got my support and vote.<br /><br />Thank you Bernie for speaking directly to the fans of the Joe Rogan show.I wouldn&#39;t vote for Bernie Sanders, but I do admire his vigor. One thing I have seen with him is that he&#39;s consistent, and that he truly believes he is doing right for the American people, whether you agree with his politics or not he at the very least comes off as one who genuinely cares.Bernie is certifiably insane, he should not be allowed near any weapon.Uhg Bernie Sanders is just a commie,,, doushbagI try to stay objective but this guy is full redtardNever trust a man, that will not look you in the eyes while he is talking to you.Can Joe ask at least one hard question? Or challenge at least one view or idea. <br />Such a softball teeing up interview.This makes realise how lucky I am not to live in America. God bless the rest of the world!Joe acts like a professional the whole time and then with less than a minute left he blows it lmaoThis is a great interview. I’m still voting for Trump-Pence 🇺🇸 If it’s not broken...Next: Shapiro, Sanders and Rogan discuss implementation of DMT into a regular healthcare plan.I bet bernie didnt get paid 15 a hour for that interview.In Canada you’re 9 hours waiting in the  emergency because we don’t have enough doctor’s. Because all the good ones left Canada it’s supposed to be 3 1/2 hour minimum wait but you’re there for the day. Its not free they charge MCP’s for it witch our high tax pay it. <br /><br />My Family doctor has me come back every two weeks to see me for one minute of every two weeks to fill out a prescription but tells me I can’t do it monthly but it’s only because he gets a charge my MCP twice so if you’re going to bring up Canada be real about our Universal healthcare. <br /><br />And our Scription drugs being cheap didn’t help when we got an epidemic of prescription drug abuse across our country doctors just throwing it out thereBill Clinton FTW!! Make it happen 🤣Bernie &quot;white people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot; SandersName the scientist Bernie....Bernie 2020!Bernie&#39;s the type of guy I&#39;d smoke a blunt with but not vote forYou&#39;re great Bernie but they&#39;ll never let you win.Mind BlownHave you heard of the toad Bernie ?mushrooms for all vote me 2024I will likely only vote for a candidate who comes on Rogan.  I like the Hawaiian lady, and now Bernie. I would also like to see Trump sit down with Joe.  Debates suck.This was better than any debate by far!!!!joe should use his platform to put on a proper debate not moderated by bullshit msm pundits. a REAL democratic debate. MAKE IT HAPPEN JOE! 🇺🇸Andrew Yang &gt; Bernie SandersI don&#39;t really even understand how people can actually listen to him and still disagree with most of what he says... he&#39;s mostly just pointing out facts.1% to 92%  I live 5 miles from a person who owns a major sports franchise i rent my house for cheap have food big ass TVs new fridge washer dryer my family is fine I don&#39;t knw wtf these dems are talking about beside the same shit trump was supposed to get rid ofI&#39;m conservative, but this was a fascinating interview. I loved hearing him speak without interference. Thank you Mr. Sanders and Mr. Rogan 🥰When he says he wants to ban assault weapons, define assault weapons. What do you mean by assault weapons?How much would our country benefit from free education?  Everyday is a lesson.Well Joe, you finally crossed into Hell. Never get involved in politics, they’re all liars and crooks.Joe knows Bernie is full of it.I really loved the beginning. Hearing him speak while uninterrupted was awesome, but he starts falling apart when ask about practical answers to real world problemsLove this shit.  Intelligent dialogue about complicated issuesStill not going to vote Bernie, but i appreciated getting to hear Bernie share his stances in a setting that was conducive to thoughtful discussion.  Ultimately we want the same thing, but i still disagree on all of his methods to get us there. Thanks for doing this episode!HOLY SHIT!!!         this guy sucks.Bernie knows the drill - he wrote the book.Bernie Sanders is an absolute gift to America. Sanders 2020!Between this and Cornell West Joe has taken his show to a whole new level.my 2 favorite peopleGreat Interview- Bernie will win in 2020Bruh, Bernie said everything i’ve been thinking.. Can someone remind me why i’m not supposed  like this guy??Not a Bernie fan but it was cool to see Joe be the change he seeks, letting politicians have a chance to lay it out instead of just getting soundbites to speakYang living in Bernies head rent free LMAOThis mister Bernie is a socialist as we call here in Europe.Trump2020!!! Not getting my gunsThis man brings a calmness to my body, it feels great. I love this type of conversation whether you like the guy or not. THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE. Not fighting back and forth, people arguing and yelling. Let each person have a discussion for an hour rather than these stupid debates. I’ve learned more from JRE than I ever learned in school and I mean that.Spark up a blunt with BernieTRUMP 2020🇺🇸💪🏻The thing about radical views is that to the radical it isn&#39;t radical. Yes, healthcare being a human right is radical. Because it&#39;s someone elses labor. A right is something you can impose on others. So if a doctor for whatever reason decides he&#39;s not going to do a procedure on a patient that they request. As a right to the citizen the government could chain the doctor down, until he does the procedure. Or take him to jail or severely punish him for infringing on the rights of another person.<br /><br />That&#39;s what a right looks like and why you can see healthcare is not a human right and that the idea itself is radical.9K People haven&#39;t watched/heard the entire video yet and <b>disliked</b> ... <b>sheeple</b>Im all set with this guy banning assault weapons isnt the answerI agree with the other people here in the comments. Host some debates Joe!“Get [Moscow] Mitch on the show and ask him that question.” - SandersCool to see him on JRE. Not to many solutions were presented to the current problems though and the solutions presented depend on guns, intimidation and violence. Same old  talking points and empty promises.Bernie bitching about corporations like Amazon not paying Federal taxes. 🙄<br />They do pay taxes, but their tax burden is lifted by business expenses of employing and serving millions.<br />AND, Bernie has been in Congress for DECADES and has done NOTHING to address any of these issues.Bernie needs Yang and Tulsi on his team man or he needs to be one of their VP. Tulsi/Sanders with Yang Secretary of State!Respect to Joe and Bernie for this interview.  But his policies are absolutely horrible.Joe, I think you have to do Chomsky now at this point.nice interviewJoe, love the long format. Please do this with as many presidential candidates as you can brother! We need this! Thanks againWaiting for that Trump-Rogan  interview@joe Rogan...I love you man and your podcast bit why don&#39;t  you ever push back on your guest.  You never challenge an idea...always agree with your guests!  Do you have a side? Pick one and stick by it!It&#39;s too bad Bernie didn&#39;t take advantage of the opportunity to discuss ALL his policies at length. He did the typical politician 1 hour only b.s. He missed out on a huge audience and a huge opportunity to get his message out in away people can digest. The rest of them that come on the show will make the same mistake...the Democrats are horrible at marketing, horrible at getting out a clear message...they are horrible. Joe hit Bernie a softball and pulled up a chair and let him decide how he wanted to deal with it and Bernie limited his opportunity. Good on Joe for having him on though. It&#39;s good for everyone to hear from these people.Dont agree on tax on trades cmon man. You can change your fortunes with a few thousand in the stock market.  Tax on trades fucks up the low income people and students in the stock market.A conversation like this is so much better than the bullshit peacocking you see in campaigning and televised debates.Have me on as a guest Mr. Rogan, I will dispel these fairy tale economics Bernie is spewingI&#39;m having a hard time believing Sanders on the economy. What does he mean by the &quot;1%&quot;? Statistically-speaking, the &quot;1%&quot; he goes on about makes, last I heard, about $170,000 per year. Joint income is about 20-30% added on to that, give or take.<br /><br />So, if I&#39;m hearing him correctly, he&#39;s talking about small business owners and people who do jobs and get paid six figures.<br /><br />My question to Bernie would be: Why does it matter to you how much I or anyone else has, if we did not break a law in acquiring it? Because Bernie, I think, doesn&#39;t get it: The rich will always find a way to squirrel away and hide what they have. People complained about Cayman Islands offshore accounts in both 2012 and 2016. What does Bernie think is going to happen if the rich get told how much they can have? They&#39;ll give government the finger and leave -- because the people with the means to do so will leave, not to mention that any kind of innovation will be shot dead sooner or later. I just think that economically-speaking, Bernie tries to say that having wealth is somehow immoral, while taking that wealth by force of law is somehow moral and altruistic. Honestly, what financial incentive would anyone have to try and work for themselves? To incentivize? To innovate? Especially if they knew the fruits of their labors were being stolen from them, because &quot;you didn&#39;t build that!&quot;?<br /><br />I&#39;ve got news for Bernie: Nobody has the right to steal anyone else&#39;s property -- and this includes by voting to steal it through legislation. Because theft is theft, no matter how you slice it -- and legitimizing such theft through government does nothing more than make such a government which votes to take property away from their rightful owners, illegitimate.<br /><br />PS: Bernie is wrong about tax dollars and where they go, just like the vast majority (95%+) of the American people. Why? Because 100% of &quot;income taxes&quot; paid  by the American worker, according to the Grace Commission report under Reagan, goes to the national debt. 100% of corporate taxes go to fund the wars the US is fighting. And I really don&#39;t think this has changed since 1987.Bernie is bat shit crazy but I thoroughly enjoy his nuttiness.I though Joe was “altright”Holy shit, the amount of ignorant pricks on here with comments like, “Bernie is so right about this stuff, he really cares about us!” Is alarming. <br />Yes, Bernie... declaring healthcare a right is a radical position. Healthcare is a commodity, largely service-based. You have NO RIGHT to demand labor from anyone.<br />The man may believe what he espouses.. he’s just dead wrong. He’s a classic progressive ideologue. Blame America, blame the wealthy... get wealthy selling books in a capitalist system. Comrade Bernie.I&#39;d love to see Joe have Trump on the show.Bernie on rogan would do far better than the loud Bernie on stage.Good listening.. I didactic Annan on assault weapons, columbine happened during the last assault weapons ban.. just saying , America is crazy.A war in the east with China?  In World War II?  Hey Bernie, the Germans didn&#39;t bomb Pearl Harbor!I want to throw up....Just piss on this old founding document because “I’m not that radicle compared to rest of the world”. Fucking MarxistScrew all those business, if you cant pay your employees a decent wage then you shouldn&#39;t be in business.......the problem with American businesses is that American business values labor as basically worthless.Fuck it’s difficult to listen to Bernie for ages. His voice is so whack.Bernie Sanders is a socialist! It&#39;s crazy to me that people support this foolYou have my vote Bernie.Expunge all marijuana charges including traffickingThe thing about Bernie is even if you don&#39;t agree with all of his ideas, he is a great human being and actually cares about the average person and the world as a whole. We need more of that.Here comes the right-wing trollsAnyone else get a pharmaceutical ad during this podcast?Can’t wait for this to get fact checked :)&quot;First.&quot; — Andrew YangThis is great though....I&#39;m with Joe on a few issues. For example the McDonald&#39;s argument. It&#39;s not supposed to be a living wage because that&#39;s not a career. But McDonald&#39;s is amazing stepping stone for anyone! My friends in highschool worked at McDonald&#39;s and it taught them leadership, customer service and most of all patience. Some still work there though as a manager. But none would want to still be a burger flipper.... because most people are capable of much more. And because of that....you get paid less....that&#39;s my 2 cents.College education was cheap because student loans where not available for most people, also everything was cheaper 50 years ago, we were on the gold standard!First thing I thought as I clicked &quot;I hope they talk about Perot.&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m30s">2:30</a> in and they&#39;re already on it.I stopped by to see how much spittle lands on Joe.... Jaime can we slow this downThis faggot.when u get the Donald on Air we can talk LOLVladimir Lenin started with the same campaign. How did that work out for the Russian people?  History repeats. <br /><br />Vladimir Lenin - Leader of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) (1898–1912)Anyone else see this is only an hour long and immediately wonder what went wrong ?elk meat for allThe killer Mike and Bernie Sanders was good also run them jewels.  👉✊Would pay good money to watch Thomas Sowell debate Bernie Sanders, would be like Zeus toying with a 5th round gassed McGregor. Listen to Walter Williams, Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell discuss healthcare, minimum wage etc. TRUE economists who know that there is no such thing as a free lunch.HAVE DONALD TRUMP AND HILARY CLINTON ON YOUR SHOW TOO ! <br /><br />LET US HEAR THEM !Knee jerk reaction- he&#39;s a fucking commie... He has no grasp on reality, and we suffer from economic socialism already by bailing out banks that destroyed our country through criminal activity in housing loans to unqualified idiots and the derivative market. Everything he is against in our economy is what socialism is. It is crony capitalism and when corporations manipulate and buy off political whores in the Senate and Congress, let alone the establishment presidents, it is the same fucking thing. Raise the wage and tax untill private citizens must close their own businesses, and large corporations keep their monopolization.<br />He is selling usefully idiots a pipe dream. He doesn&#39;t have the balls to do anything but increase tax and government dependants. If he would abolish the Patriot act, stop corporations from stockpiling data and profiling citizens it would be one thing, but when you give the government more power through tax and regulation and keep the same police state in place it is fucking socialism. He doesn&#39;t have a clue on how to fix the economy. Taxing corporations has already destroyed our manufacturing base and gave China a fucking place at the mantle of world power and they are communists who slave their population and use technology to monitor them and give them a social score that provides them opportunity depending on how much government dick they suck. Who helped them, Google and other big tech companies. They want to do the same shit here and will under democratic socialism. Higher education isn&#39;t gender fucking studies. Make them pay for their own stupidity, it&#39;s not my fault.<br />  Pharmaceutical companies giving millions of Americans psychoactive drugs that have warning labels that warn of homicidal and suicidal thoughts.<br /> Hunting has nothing to do with the second amendment. The government that still has these guns needs to be kept in check. Every fascists and communistic government that takes away people&#39;s guns usually kills millions through democide next. The liberal teachers are traumatizing our children with gun drills and over medicating our kids instead of raising them. <br />  Pharma is making people fucking crazy, and commies have no place in a free and prosperous country.Bernie is lying to you.  Fasting is free!! and eliminates most of these diseases people “need” medicine forDoes he want to take away our guns?Jeffrey Epstein benefitted from Trump&#39;s tax cuts.That reality break when Bernie&#39;s right and people choose not to believe itWhat does this have so many dislikes ? Regardless of your political views him having on Bernie n tulsi on is amazing. Like he said at the beginning instead of 45 seconds u get to see a full sit down n talk about their stance to then decide that they r not ur candidate for president. I just dont see how u could dislike that in anyway shape or form. If u believe their ideas are ao bad then let them be exposed to a wider audience as such or come out as a great idea of ur for that candidate. I just cant stand this whole thing of people getting mad about certain people that are given a platform as big as joe rogan like hes supposed to pass on some1 as big as Bernie as a guest cuz of ur beliefs. Somehow this comedian has to be the arbiter of what is right n wrong n should only have certain people on not realizing the other side thinks the same thing depending on the guest it&#39;s just fucking stupid.reminds me of my lawyer lmaoThat Last question about the Aliens was great. Great way to end a good interview. Nice work JoeOur healthcare is nowhere near as good as American healthcare.Fuck the trumps let’s get this fucking win Bernie SandersJoe when are you going to interview OrangeMan Jr? You know, the one who&#39;s father I&#39;m going to vote for?I hope Crazy Bernie runs again so that Trump gets another 4 years.I would gladly pay a little more in taxes so that my friends, family, neighbors and my fellow countrymen and even a foreign visitor in need can get the healthcare they need.Tag joe rogan on president trump social to get him on a 1on1FUcking Bernie man!!!!!!! Hell yeahI agree that college is too expensive but if you make it completely free you&#39;ll have even more nitwits studying worthless bs like gender studies. Make it cheaper for actually useful degrees like STEM and let the market sort out the useless ones. Cancelling the existing student debt is a bad idea, it just rewards people who made stupid. decisions.444,000 views and 22,000 comments numbers numbers!If insurance can be obtained for everyone without destroying all of our paychecks go for it. Oh wait, it can&#39;t. Delusion personified.Boy the Sanders campaign are all up in this comment sectionI&#39;m calling it, Trump is going to be on JRE for his 2020 campaignwow Bernie talked for over an hour and said absolutely nothing...If Trump went on Rogan the internet would melt.Get this commie outta here Joe! The purpose of socialism is communism. It&#39;s all a mirage.Same old story Joe. Get Eddy Bravo in other chair now!America gave millions to banks on the house crash, should give to estudents to.Joe Rogan should have all the candidates on here one at a time including President Trump. That would be amazing!Lead the world.  <br />New world orderCuckservatives lol. Look at the dislikes.. Chuds are mad.How fucking crazy would it be of Joe interviewed Donald Trump?!! That would break the internet!Bernie Sanders cares about you...he really does. But if you do what he says, you&#39;ll end up spiraling down into a deep dark hole along with the rest of suffering humanity. If the souls of the dead could come back from history and tell you this truth, they would.He can&#39;t answer how we remove 400 million guns without knocking on people&#39;s doors. I think if this country decides to take assault weapons away they going to have to knock on people&#39;s doors. Not all, but definitely some.&quot;the quality of care is as good&quot; ACCORDING TO WHO?!?Only one hour interview? Man I love Bernie! I would&#39;ve love to hear more from.Bernie. Amazon doesn&#39;t pay taxes because they didn&#39;t generate any more. They re-invested everything they made. As goes for how to solve other issues you can&#39;t just say we&#39;ll get all the people to help. To help do what? Are they&#39;re just going to stand around in a circle fix the world with good vibes? Do you have any practical answers to any of these problems?It’s like Diet YangThe last question was perfect 😂George Washington said that any american could freely own and purchase grenades, rifles, mortars, cannons and howitzers and accompanying minitions to defend oneself, their neighbor and property of said I individuals form harm or theft. There was one instance of an individual owning and firing a cannon within city limits and only constitutionally allowed restriction was the individual was not permitted to fire the cannon after dark recreationally with a discharge relating to self defense being permitted.Canadian healthcare is not good. Dont listen to him, its not better. Long waits, cant choose good docs. Docs are paid shit, so we have shit docs. There are many reasons you dont want universal mandatory health careJoe you should host a political debate.I feel Bernie is genuinely for change, the people, and the world, and is someone who I truly believe would surround himself with the best staff and humans to run this country. I am not 100% on board with his policies, but if he became president, I would be at peace with the good he wants to do with our country.<br /><br />Plus, I think I could fall asleep to his “quiet voice” every night for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Simply, I really appreciate this man, and this podcast. Thanks, Joe.YES CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL... THE QUESTION IS NOT IS IT REAL, but, WHAT IS THE MAIN CAUSE?! stop with this climate change denier bullshit, where&#39;s Randall when you need him!I noticed they can never really define assault weapon. You can assault someone with any weapon.Mr. Rogan &amp; Mr. Sanders. Thank you for doing what you do and being who you are.  This has been one of the most enlitening political conversations I&#39;ve ever witnessed.this healthcare for all i wish could happen but it’s not realistic at all.Communist China: millions dead<br />Communist Russia: millions dead and starved <br />Khmer Rouge Commies: millions dead<br />Communist Albania: hundreds of thousands dead<br />Communist Cuba: thousands dead or missing, Cubans in Florida literally hate their home government, literal hate. <br /><br />But it’s okay guys, Vermont senator/millionaire Bernie “Hillary stole the nom from me but vote for her anyway” Sanders and my college professors said that socialism will work in the United States because roads and the military are a form of socialism and it works in tiny white majority countries!!!!!!!! What can go wrong?!?!?!?<br /><br />Edit: also fuck borders and voter ID laws plus you can be any gender you make up in your mind oh and along with sweeping power the government should also ban guns because who needs a gun when you can call the police. But also the police are racist and should not be trusted. Thank god I went to college or those Redneck trump supporters wouldn’t have anyone to show them how smart libs are amirightCame here to see the &quot;insta-downvote&quot; ratio. The Russian bots did not disappoint. LOL.Our only hope , love this man 🇺🇸🇲🇽Bernie 2020 🔥🔥Climate change has been forever....  maybe you should say climate distruction or climate murder....idk.  maybe start by name it simi correctly.<br />Everything seems to be bullshit anymore how does he or anyone else know their info is truthfulFar from ever getting behind a guy like Bernie who has never supplied a need or service to anyone. I do appreciate the long form political discussions , this is the only way the country can come back together.bernie is very good at avoiding questions, because he has no answers. Ban assault weapons he says, uh how would that work? He never answered that question.I will hear him out but did he try to pretend he had a phone call to make the pod cast short?I&#39;ve been watching you for years Joe rogan, from fear factor to UFC and intermittently on JRE over the years, but almost daily now in the past year.  The demographic and ideologies that sit across from you daily is very diverse, representing a large majority of America.  You&#39;re evolving into one hell of an interviewer, and your influence is/will become massive. A huge thank you for having representation from both parties on your show, allowing america to transparently hear the real answers to the real hard questions.  That profound West interview last week sucked me in from the start, and again today with Bernie. There are many good candidates running in 2020, but Bernie has my vote as he&#39;s been the purest about his stance since the 70&#39;s. He  got fed a bad hand with the super-delegates in 2016, and took the higher road endorsing Hillary after the fact. This man is the epitome of what it means to be a leader, and the only question remaining is; is America conscious enough to accept basic human rights over corporate greed?Bernie loves to throw out stats, say how bad things are, and how they could have been. Joe asks him how to fix the problem and Bernie just describes the problem again hahaKudos to Joe and his crew!Donald J. Trump GET YOUR GOLDEN SPRAYED ASS ON JOE ROGAN BEFORE RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION!!!35mins for gun owners. I am just a single guy,  I&#39;m nothing. I would fight to the death to stop a run away government.... I do not believe these shootings have anything to do with legislation. If they take away your protection, we will never be safe. I like Bern, I want him as a leader, but every citizen should be able to protect themselves from the government. No matter the logic, no matter the bullshit, if a citizen cannot protect themselves from a government, we will never be safe from a couple of guys in black suits showing up to your neighborhood one by one, dearming your friends and family. Again, I&#39;m just a random dude, I drink too much, but I know this easily, America will always be a country that you have to kick in EVERY FUCKING DOOR, to conquer. Nobody you know is shooting up schools, nobody you know is shooting up a church.... an asshole will not show up to your door with a smile, if they know you have a gun. Feel me.If it wasn’t for crooked Hilary , Bernie Sanders would be President today.Bernie Sanders is trying to wakeup America!! We can&#39;t become the United states of corporate America!! Together we stand divided we fall !! Wakeup America !!!Great episode! Now get Dan Crenshaw in the show!This guy is such a phony politician. I enjoy these conversations, but it is so disgusting watching him play such emotional bullshit.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=18m53s">18:53</a> raising the minimum wage decreases the value of our currency and harms small businesses. If we wanted to help small businesses we would create more jobs, stem our immigration, and impose more taxes upon the big corporations. Otherwise, jobs will be lost to accomodate the raise in wages, small businesses will suffer having to bear the brunt of the cost and the big multinational corporations will either just eat it because they can afford it or they will turn to AI and automation (see McDonald&#39;s and Taco Bell for the order yourself menus, cutting out the job of a cashier)HOLY FUCKING SHITLike for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Tulsi Gabbard &gt; Bernie SandersMissed opportunity. Should’ve played USSR anthem during intro lol<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> Always was the first option because his ideas are the future.Your team bad, my team good.he had me, HE FUCKIN HAD ME!! then like a fuckin hero joe rogan goes to gun control, and in the first 30 seconds after Bernie reminds me how much of a fuckin idiot he is, this libtard mother fucker, it should be illegal for someone to run for president while telling such blatant lies! And if he believes the bs hes talking then hes definitely unfit to lead! TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, AGAIN!YOOO This happened? Really not a Sanders fan but this is sickI like Bernie even less after this. The wants to make so many laws forcing people to do things, he opens with saying we could legislate laws to force TV companies to allow all candidates to have air time.  Just go online for free don&#39;t force people.Not really any tough questions - I&#39;m disappointed!Next Joe Rogan interviews Donald J Trump?It was a good interview, but not sure Bernie got Joe&#39;s question about how to reduce corporate influence. He talks about it on his website under &quot;Get Big Money Out of Politics and Restore Democracy.&quot; A big part is overturning Citizens United, which will most likely require a constitutional amendment. Also abolishing super pacs, moving toward public funding of elections and ending gerrymandering among other things.We need a task force against white supremacy!Well the ‘94 ban did nothing to solve the violence problem which was why it was allowed to sunset.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m00s">35:00</a> - Gun shows are made up of FEDERALLY LICENSED FIREARMS DEALERS, every table selling firearms holds an FFL, every individual purchasing a firearm from one of these FFLs had to fill out an ATF 4473, and do a FBI NICS check, after that process, if the 4473 is complete and correct (meaning that there is no anomalies) and the FBI NICS check comes back CLEAN, the FFL can LEGALLY transfer the firearm to an individual. PS- an AR-15 is not an assault rifle, it does NOT posses the ability to be Fully automatic (Meaning if the trigger is pulled once the firearm fires more than once) it operates no differently than an SVT-40 or M1 Garand from World War 2, it just has contemporary ergonomic features. Legally purchasing a firearm and selling it to a criminal element is called a STRAW PURCHASE, $250,000 fine and 10 years in prision. FFS if the government would actually enforce whats already on the books -.-Get Marianne Williamson on Joe!He cant pay his own people what he wants everyone to pay..he is a walking example of why his policies don&#39;t workTwo words: Randall CarlsonIt boggles my mind that people who watch JRE, a platform meant for long-form discussions where people on the outsides can get a chance to explain themselves, dislike the video and leave immediately based on the guest for the dayGreat interview Joe! Thank you for being so respectful and giving  Bernie productive questions and good amount of time to answer. <br />🔥 BERN 2020 🔥wanna play a game? drink every time he says freeThis is one of the most serious interviews I&#39;ve ever heard Joe give, props to you for this podcast, you had very good responses and questions.I really hope this starts a new trend. Get all the candidates on both sides to sit down n explain they’re policy for all the people who want more than sound bites,talking points and buzz words to inform how they voteThis mother fucker is stupid . Lol i cant wait for all the videos about to come outThat last question tho LMFAOGet off my Lawn!  And everything is free!....This was great!Our government can&#39;t manage our 30 percent marginal tax bracket let alone free healthcare with a 60 percent bracket.<br /><br />Show me some accountability and I may reconsider. But good luck with that. It ain&#39;t happening in my lifetime. Not with 90 percent of the stupid and corrupt lobbyist and politicians  we have in congress.Every answer of Bernie’s can be boiled down to this sentence: “That’s not how they do it in other countries”.I would be no means consider myself a liberal, but I loved this.  Even if you don’t agree with what he says, this is the kind of uninterrupted conversation and explanation that we need to really know what we’re voting for.  Bernie’s right about the debates being bogus.  Who can explain themselves in an environment like that.  Excellent work Joe, and thank you Bernie for risking criticism and hateful comments to explain what you believe.  This is called progress.It don’t stop him from taking money from them and he doesPlease get trumpWow and just when u thought it was safe to watch the joe rogan show 😂😂Hey I think it&#39;s cool that The President Tweets. It&#39;s about how you use twitter that really matters. The President should use it for good not to shame, or bash people or to let off steam.Didn’t know, I’m not American , good ideas, very like here in Europe, education costs 0, health cost 0.Be a lot cooler if it was Tulsi Gabbard #3 instead of Bernie.seeing a lot of bernie fans talking about anti bernie comments/taking on conservatives, all i see are people like &quot;i dont like bernie that much but i like that hes on the podcast&quot;, have i not scrolled down far enough?SOMEBODY RUN WITH THIS IDEA!!!<br /><br />Look up in Ted talks &quot;the most important lesson from 83,000 brain scans: Daniel Amen&quot; <br /><br />To sum it up though, they found from over 83,000 brain scans that there is much more we can do for mental health patients. The brain scans allow to see the actually activity of the brain and understand more thoroughly instead of going just based off clusters of symptoms....<br />EVERYONE could get one of these brain scans as part of the background check to check for mental health when purchasing weapons. This along with a few more precautions to help from other angles and theres your mass shooting problem solved.Are you seriously thinking about voting this dinosaur into office? No way he got the stamina to be a president at that age. And who’s gonna be the Vice President? Thats just as important in this caseI wonder how many people were so brainwashed by right-wing MSM that labels him a &#39;communist&#39; that they disliked the video before they even listened to it.Nothing against Bern but whos gonna pay for that shit just bc I make more money my taxes still go up to pay for the guy who&#39;s been living on the streets pan handling and still doesn&#39;t want to work for food even though that&#39;s the sign he holds everyday making a 100 bucks a day that&#39;s how they want to live and be left alone I want to work and be left alone. There&#39;s people that want to work and there&#39;s people that want to be homeless and beg that&#39;s there choiceThis motherfucker can’t even do 2 hours on joe’s podcast and he wants to be president give me a break what a joke he is so Fucken oldWeird communist sex pervert Bernie Sanders !This idiot can’t be allowed to be presidentSo solutions, only messageI was with him until the minimum wage thing.  I’m not paying 16 year olds who need to learn basic life skills the same as someone more qualified.  Simply not happening lol.  He loses my vote right there.Joe rogan has a very intellectually divirse audience this was a fantastic idea for bernie to spread his ideas.Look at the dislike bar...a bunch of partisan hacks who can&#39;t handle disagreementI love Bernie!!!!!Pudding for all but mostly for me<br />- Bernie SandersStill voting Yang by far but I&#39;m glad for this opportunity to hear Bernie speak in this setting. Bernie points boosted substantially in my book.Bernie&#39;s identified a lot of problems with the current system but his solutions are dogshit. It would probably help if he learned some basic economic theory&quot;July was the warmest July in history&quot; LOLHas Bernie ever done dmtNEVER CLICKED FASTER IN MY LIFE!How about for people with adult ADHD make it easier to get assess to too.I&#39;m thirty-something. I&#39;m so old, now, that the digit in the ones-place doesn&#39;t matter enough for me to remember it. I want to go back to school but can&#39;t because my credit is still shit from the first time i went to school. Every other candidate talks about &#39;kids&#39; going to college, and &#39;young people,&#39; and &#39;our children.&#39; Bernie&#39;s never said a word about kids going to school. Bernie wants everyone who wants to to go to school. Bernie wants me to go back to school. This is how you win my vote. Go, Go, Bernie Sanders!I dont think he answered one question directly.Great podcast. I would love it if you ever got the opportunity to have President Trump on the show. You are a great interviewer, and it would be very interesting to get him in a 1v1 discussion like thisI love the show and I think Bernie has a good heart but I don’t think socialism is a good idea in any form for the USHe needs to get Prager or Mark Levine on there next. You know, contrasting views and all...Way to bite off Andrew Yang&#39;s talking points, Bernie. I&#39;m really disappointed, I had mad respect for him.Fuck Bernie soft ass ....Socialism destroys every nation that does it.  Some things you have 2 pay 4Bernie is a commie. Interview TrumpShould have been 3 hoursDang Joe Rogan is like the new Larry King! Every year his show seems to expand further in all aspects of conversations. Great job Joe!I wish burn would look joe in the eyesWait for it...wait for it....yes, he asks the alien question at the very end...NICE!Bernie&#39;s ideas will completely destroy every small business in this country,.  The only thing left will be huge corporations who will continue to control the weak and corrupt politicians.  Don&#39;t kid yourself, Bernie is dangerous.Bernie is absolutely the modern day FDR !! And will be a GREAT president.  SANDERS 2020 ..The Young Turks.Where is his neck?Bernie &quot;the burdern of $15 minimum wage will be spread across all businesses&quot; Sanders.Required viewing for every Lapel Flag wearing “patriot”Its crazy to me that people need a license or permit to own a gun because every American has the right to bear arms. Now imagine having to get a permit to engage in free speech... If these people get their way that will be a reality, and that is what is really scaryJoe should host a debateClimate change is a hoax<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=3m26s">3:26</a> The internet has indeed revolutionized politics by breaking the mainstream media&#39;s monopoly on the flow of information. Alternative media, independent blogs, /r/the_donald helped Trump get elected.This is the way politics should be discussed not on sound bites and Tv commercials!<br />Why the dislikes ?<br />I’m puzzled by irrational quick hatred for his ideals..I like a few things about bernie, I dislike a few things about his platformHe talks about all of these issues as though Trump has been in office for 30 years! Republicans AND democrats have ruined this country with policies catering to big Corp and big pharma. Politicians are crooks and do not have our best interests at heart. Bernie is no different.“Rep VT like my name Bernie Sanders “ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nothingnowhere">#nothingnowhere</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hammer">#hammer</a>Curious who is paying the scientist to tell you/us that climate change is real or wrong<b>Gets an ad for David Spades TV Show in the middle of the Bernie&#39;s podcast</b><br /><br />&quot;DAMN YOU BIG PHARMA&quot;As a Canadian, you fucks better get healthcare or our shit is going to get way more expensiveBernie doesn&#39;t like to make eye contactDemocratic Candidates and Bernie think Americans are stupid? Mike Huckabee stands a better chance than any of them of winning the Democratic Party, let alone Frank and Move Maker Trump. Who is Bernie&#39;s handler or boss?What they did was stupify a major part of the population by getting greedy over higher education. How many geniuses have been dismissed by this?communist bastard...try and ban our guns you old quackI&#39;d vote for Bernie if he were blackBernies 2020 campaign slogan: &quot;America isnt great&quot; <br /><br />Democrats: Yes.&quot;Jamie, can you pull up why amazon didnt pay taxes the previous year for Bernie here&quot;Bernie is the only politician that I can tell actually gives a shit about me.I wonder how a [relatively] lengthy interview like this with Trump would go. No substance to be had; just tough guy persona and a bunch of &quot;Believe me!&quot;s.  Too bad Republican voters couldn&#39;t pick someone better.I’m selling my Trumpy Bear 🐻 🇺🇸Joe is the one who is presidential. Much smarter and more in touch with reality than Bernie. <br />If Joe ran as a Democrat - he would give Trump a real challenge. Bernie... not so  much. <br />Who does Bernie hang out with where people boast about their yachts?<br />How are you going to help re-employ coal workers when you have open borders?<br />Throwing more money at education has not worked to improve education - it just gives the unions more of a chance to suck more money from the government.Thanks Joe Rogan and thanks Bernie Sanders!  These are the most important issues in American culture today, and Bernie is the only candidate that&#39;s approaching the heart of the issue: distribution of wealth.Bernie is the man.Went to medical school, obtained a doctorate, can&#39;t afford $400,000 in debt when you are going to make 4 million over 20 years. Strange.9.1k dislikes already...people are very open to the battle of ideas!Why doesn’t Bernie make eye contact ?HOLY SHIT...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=56m41s">56:41</a>....the others may off him for saying that last group lolgamer rise upLow key wanted bernie to take a jab at biden with a &quot;if you agree with this podcast, you can text the number 3.... o... 3..3........o......3......0&quot;Joe YOU ROCK!!&quot;I believe in science.&quot; Right, so trannies are what they were born as? Or are you gonna flip flop?creates policies that make things more expensive like guaranteed loans and then complains about how expensive they are.... this cockroach never even worked a real job dont trust this snake oil salesman.Sadfully, he didn&#39;t explain how all this is literally being paid for, he threw words like wall Street and big businesses around. I love his vision, but it&#39;s sloppy. <br />Staying with Trump I suppose..Bernie is a socialist piece of trash, most if not all socialist ideas are unconstitutional and       asinine “democratic” socialism has basically no differences to socialism and when they say if we get rid of guns no more violent crimes well what about trucks and cars. You can go through the streets of New York and run over tons of pedestrians so what do you ban cars “which is utterly ridiculous” it’s not about guns or weapons it’s about CONTROL. Also most of these morons know little to nothing about firearms!We need Wes Watson on the next podcast.Some time stamps for anyone in a rush:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m22s">0:22</a> -  Are the debates to time constrained <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m22s">4:22</a> - The misconceptions Bernie Sanders faces and how he would reform healthcare in the US<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=10m40s">10:40</a> - Lobbying and the influence it has <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=16m07s">16:07</a> - Bernie&#39;s agenda as president <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=18m57s">18:57</a> - Minimum wage<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=21m19s">21:19</a> - How to tackle tax loopholes for big corporations and student loan debt <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=31m57s">31:57</a> - Gun control and gun violence <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=42m15s">42:15</a> - Mental health issues in the US<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=45m27s">45:27</a> - Marijuana and drug law reform <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=54m33s">54:33</a> - Impoverished communities and what can be done to help them <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=57m58s">57:58</a> - Is being president an impossible job <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h00m03s">1:00:03</a> - Climate change <br /><br /><br />Much love to you all out there.That’s why the Canadian comes here for surgery it’s a 6 month waitTulsi stepped down from her high paying job at the DNC to stand up for Bernie.

You were once the leaders. Stand up!Not even gunna watch this one and iv seen every single one.. Automatic dislike!If only Joe called Crowder and had him come over before Bernie, Crowder could hide in a closet wait for Bernie to sit down.. then start. <br />And then everytime bernie says something dumb or wrong, Crowder can yell corrections from the closet in his “Bernie voice”.. <br /><br />If only..So happy when he asked about aliens. Whole time I was thinking he should ask him lolWhy isn&#39;t Alex Jones here to scream at these fags!Notice also Bernie loves to use an unverifiable claim.<br />&quot;A 50 year old guy told me...&quot; <br />&quot;Teens tell me...&quot;<br />&quot;A woman told me...&quot;<br />Proves nothing and disingenuous.Joe it can be implemented in the next month that&#39;s not the point the point is there communist man this isn&#39;t a debate between me and Bernie or me and you or me and anybody I&#39;m telling you all personally that if you try to steal money from me to keep the assholes you try to kill me to stay alive I&#39;m going to flip the f*** out promise dude I kind of agree with Bernie Sanders about their price price-fixing here in America on medical supplies but you want to know the honest truth about why that happens do you know why other countries are able to afford medicine and their price range because we&#39;re rich as fuc we paid for that discounted medicine in Canada already it&#39;s already a f*<b>***</b> world tax on us so I do agree with that I don&#39;t want to be taxed in this way either for corporate greedy assholes Global endeavors. And then when I think about it in this way it makes me think while you&#39;re a globalist Bernie f*** borders right so you&#39;re down for what they&#39;re doingIncoming shitlibs vs cuckservativesJoe had to fit aliens in there.Imagine your family out shopping just to get shot by some miserable asshole..BERNIE HAS MY VOTE!!!! 💕💕💕This chumps an absolute parasiteIf you have people working for you and they&#39;re doing a good job why not pay them 15 bucks an hour. No that&#39;s radical and crazy 15 bucks an hour. Hahahaha“It is curious that people tend to regard government as a quasi-divine, selfless, Santa Claus organization. Government was constructed neither for ability nor for the exercise of loving care; government was built for the use of force and for necessarily demagogic appeals for votes.&quot; -- Murray RothbardBernie call them terrorist. I can tell you right now Hispanics and blacks are cautious about what we do. Some even scared.I live in the UK and only hear the 3rd hand news coverage of American politics which mostly consists of, in a nutshell &quot;What has Donald Trump done now?&quot; The UK political scene is a shit show right now and yet it still doesn&#39;t compare to America&#39;s. Bernie Sanders seems to making waves everywhere, in my opinion and he is doing it for the right reasons. He is a politician that genuinely comes across as someone who wants to make the world a better place and not &quot;profit&quot; off it. I can understand, there will always be people who have different opinions but I just like that, to me, he isn&#39;t in politics to further himself but to further society.<b>F sellout Sanders..

I&#39;ll pass on the old politician with old politics (looking at you, Biden).You’re cool Bernie, but you won’t sway me on the minimum wage thing.I about died when he said “a yacht that’s 3 miles long.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=56m00s">56:00</a>BERNIE! JOE! YES!18 min, and hes literally saying nothing but rally rhetoricBernie had me until he said America wasnt great 3 times in a row. This is the greatest country on Earth 10x over. If you disagree your politcally, economically, and culturally unimformed.Just dropping by to say<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>FinallyY dont u just make gov&#39;t small instead of imposing a facist policy of banning lobbyist. Jesus christ, how dumb do u have to be.....Good job joe getting the big bern. Good to hear his ideas in long format. No doubt the country is making more money with trump. I am, you are, a lot of Americans are. I’m scared to loose that with sanders. But I hear a lot of good he wants to do with our country and for my kids.Bernie represents more Americans than any other candidate, period.Man im not a democrat but bernie doesnt sound bad.<br />EDIT: i do not agree with his 2nd amendment stance.Thanks JRE! Amazing recent set of podcasts.Andrew Yang is the best candidate  Bernie is an Interesting candidate but is Idea about work is passe in a world of robot. Robot can work for people the idea is you have to make it benefit everybody from it and only Andrew Yang understand it all other candidate are not smart enough only Andrew Yang understand the future that is coming now.Whole lotta questions asked with no real answers... typical same ol political bs..Great podcast! Thank you!Jeffrey star putting on makeup is trending over this.. come on youtubeHey Bernie, it’s called state universities.So, a guy wants a 15 dollar minimum wage, but doesnt pay his workers that AND wants free college when his wife was running higher education into the ground.  But i would be very interested in seeing his gun measures in effectThis dude is fulla shit hahahahaa Knight himthey need to stop giving joe biden and warren all the attention at the debates so many other better candidates out there imoWe’ve been told we have “no Great War” - climate change &amp; prison reform are OUR Great War.Im not a Bernie fan but giving him this platform and hearing him out is very nice. Thanks Joe for keeping us from our ecochambersBrings me to tears seeing a person running for office with such integrity, passion, and hope in the face of such a daunting situationthis nigga look like a white older version of rajon rondohe shouldnt have said the words assault weapons ban on rogan tbhJoe, I would love to see Pres Trump on your show.  Make it happen please!!Thanks Joe. Bernie is such a genuine guy, which is much missing from US politics today.We all love you even more now Joe Rogan!!!!! Awesome !You gotta love the alien question that Joe slips in at the end.I understand that it really is not an issue to many people but I feel like Joe let Bernie slide on the question of drugs. In Bernie&#39;s mind it is unacceptable to have a &quot;wrong&quot; opinion on healthcare and global warming and debt but he is completely content to have a wrong opinion on drugs.Bernie is full of sheet. College prices skyrocketed once the government started getting into student loansSanders - Yang 2020<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=8m04s">8:04</a> The money they make doesn&#39;t make the whole story. This is one of the issues I have with Bernie it seems to be the politics of envy. I know people will argue against that but that&#39;s how I tend to see the socialist critisms of these companies.<br />I believe there is a left wing but liberal way to argue for socialised healthcare but the money these companies make alone is not itJoe how do you get the most unique group of people that are amazing... thank youPolitical arguments are the same topics and the same points argued over and overHow are any of Bernie&#39;s proposals any different from me running for President on the platform that if I win everyone gets a pony? He&#39;s literally just telling people what they want to hear. Don&#39;t fall for the con.Joe, <br />You see how he diverted the the questioon on hardcore drugs . <br />Pharma is a cartel too, i was waiting for you to say it! Lol<br />If he can throw the second ammenment under the bus but cant talk about how the system is oiled with profitting off of the lower class all around the board. Crime pays .$$<br />Ijs . <br />He failed, but he showed me his hand! <br />Peace Brother!I dont respect anyone who wants to speak on work and hasnt worked for over 1/2 his life! Small hat subversive tool&quot;free&quot; shit for all!!!I very good argument can be made against the character of LBJ and even more so against the policies which he enacted the shit show that was Vietnam the welfare program targeting black mother&#39;s that is still destroying the black family today and let&#39;s not act like EVERYONE is a fan of his health care programs there&#39;s also the somewhat credible possiblity that he had Kennedy assassinated to usurpe him as president???Love Bernie; he&#39;s genuine and consistent, plus he truly cares about <b>every</b> American! The polls claiming that Biden has a lead are entirely fabricated. I&#39;ve never met a Biden supporter, but I know loads of people who support Bernie, Tulsi, and a couple who like Yang. The MSM and DNC are, once again, attempting to manufacture consent for the oligarchy&#39;s choice. Don&#39;t fall for it!He&#39;s largely right on diagnosing the issues. Not sure I agree with his proposed interventions but big ups to Joe for having him on.YANGGANG! Bernie is gonna have a stroke arguing with Trump, we need someone who can destroy Trump with MATH!F🙃Ck Bernie - Joe Rogan for president!Comrade Sanders is a fucking prick and a race baiting cunt. He&#39;s a lying hypocritical and deluded fuckwit and should not be voted for, he&#39;d ruin America.Only wish this was longer!Joe is really using his platform to it&#39;s full potential! He gave this man 1 hour to voice his opinions commercial-free.Before I waste my time, on what could be a propaganda echo chamber, did Joe challenge Bernie in any way about some of his radical positions, the history of socialism and communism, his race baiting, his identity politics, or and falsehoods, and lies he is proven to have told. How about him CAMPAIGNING FOR and ENDORSING Hillary Clinton, after she and the DNC, stole the nomination from Bernie via the Super Delegates, and their rigged primary system? Cuz if not a lot of what&#39;s mentioned above happened, it&#39;s propaganda. Before I waste my time....Very Right Leaning, I Enjoy you having Bernie on to discuss his views in depth. If only this could happen to all the people running. Thanks Joe, Even though you couldve talked for longerI am so happy Bernie did this! Hopefully this will inspire more to love the common countryman as he does!We need trump on here Rogan!Vote Bernie over fascist TrumpFuck BernieBernie is trying to be a revolutionist but he isn’t strong and outgoing. He doesn’t have the status-quo leadership qualities of a revolutionist. You know who does? TrumpTRUMP 2020Bernie&#39;s decentBernie is a nice guy, but gosh he doesn’t understand all the moving parts and consequences of his proposed ideas. Just the minimum wage idea he couldn’t really justify very well when hoe gave him a hint of resistance and even screwed up the free market argumentThank you for this!! Both to Joe &amp; Bernie!!<br /><br />(But, in WW2 we were at war with Japan. ;) )While I believe Bernie to be pretty authentic in his message, it still scares me.  The stuff that he is pitching will remove any power from private industry and give it to the government.  Private industry needs to keep customers happy the government doesnt.  The government gets your money either way because its in the form of taxes. They can raise taxes and there is no just going to the other business to save money, because govt is the only business.  While Bernie might not be a problem it just takes one power hungry leader, that now has control over a much larger portion of our economy, to start authoritarian type situation. Would progressives be ok with Trump controlling healthcare and education? Thats what Bernie is proposing.  Thats why socialism has a low success ratio.  Its a nice idea but it allows the govt to control large swathes of your life.  The govt giveth and the govt can taketh away.This dude should be the next prez he just makes so much sense. He gotta great story too as far as his background which doesn&#39;t get told enough. Probably should do VladTV and tell his background story so people are more familiar with who he is as a person and where he&#39;s coming from with policyThe 2 most ass kicking baldies in show biz!If you raise minimum wage you will raise inflation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m00s">27:00</a><br /><br />Highschool diploma was sufficient to obtain middleclass standard of living. University level education was unnecessary and a luxury. When my grandfather went through university his total yearly cost was around $1000.<br /><br />To account for population growth and simple supply and demand it should be no surprise that with competition to reach middleclass comes a rise in the costs to obtain that degree.“I believe in a ban”.....*seconds later* “I believe in the 2nd amendment” despite all the false/ignorant gun comments. I’ll admit I am no way a left thinking person let alone a Bernie supporter, but I do believe it it important to hear out both sides for many different reasons. And although this wasn’t too horrible to listen to, the firearm ignorance ruins the small portion of good things he had to say. while Bernie has some good ideas on paper. I believe he needs to rethink his ways he wants to execute them and stop flip flopping on his opinions and stating false statements to get a certain portion of the populations vote like mentioned above.Have nina turner on next .Bernie the old whack job money whore !!! He actually seems civil so far. Acts like a fucking idiot on the senate floor.I hate Bernie’s first five minutes, you have the internet, you don’t need big media. His energy is so low.Yo burny... Why is it ok for congress for to use insider trading tips on wall street? I&#39;ve never heard you speak out against that.... Ohh I know why, cause it made you rich. You damn liar. Forked tongue liar. Enters in public service middle class (his wife ripped off and cause a college to shut down--haha bitch) and now he&#39;s a 1%er.. crook!!Imagine if Joe could get Trump on here talking like a normal person.... imagineBernie points out a lot of the right problems and proposes all of the wrong solutions. He’s a career politician who understands nothing about economics or incentives and relies on demonizing the rich. Can’t respect him at all after 2016 and his spreading of straight up lies and propaganda on social media.Feel the 🔥<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m00s">1:07:00</a> the question that really matters hereKudos to the conservatives keeping an open mind on this chat. Major respect, need more of that on both sides.Please have Noam Chomsky on!Corporations and the rich are sucking the country dry. We need to stop thinking of things from the perspective of tribal political parties. Both parties are in bed with the money. They&#39;re both doing the bidding of corporations. Take the country back for the people.I miss my yang manLol china was our ally after pearl harbor. I think he meant we fought Japan after PH. this guys a looney toonBernie is finally a politician that stands for the people for the middle class and for the fourRenewable Energy is a Scam.. Dont believe me? watch this.. : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL6uB1z95gA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL6uB1z95gA</a>Great!Someone pay to broadcast this prime time TVI really wish Burnie would be more willing to connect the insane state of the modern human condition when Joe asks him about gun violence. It may not be super clear, but Joe has many other thinkers like Russel Brand on who have made the connections and recognize that the greed of the elite, the political corruption, the constant state of mental unrest affecting millions of people, all of that contributes to some answer to Joe&#39;s question of why and how can we stop it. It&#39;s systemic, and humanizing people who do unforgivable things is something that can help the country understand why citizens go out and shoot up crowded places. Joe talked with Maynard James Keenan last week about community and belonging. It starts there. Gradually removing the power of huge corporations by raising their taxes, putting the lower class at ease so they feel like they have the opportunity to achieve a better life in the middle class or above. Disillusioned people, who feel abandoned by the society they exist adjacent to commit these acts. Their actions are depraved, yes. But understanding that anyone under different circumstances could have turned out that way too ala Jordan Peterson regarding Nazi Germany, who Joe spoke with st length multiple times, is a factor as well.<br />Bernie mentions it with the &quot;disease of despair&quot;.<br />People living happily is not utopian, he&#39;s correct. Maintaining hope for action for a brighter future can prevent a dystopian reality.The internet is making the need to have network TV unnecessaryThank. Joe for having Bernie on. It was very informative. I hope this help change some minds about his ideasnot an American, but I don&#39;t get why this man is not president?Honestly he’d have my vote if he had more conservative views on gun controlTheir tackling diabetes?  No! they are selling us insulin, insulin pumps and all the accessories needed for that, needles, bloodsuger messurer, strips.  I have heard of several solutions to cure diabetes over the years, i remember one well, where they were looking for funding and could not get it..  These companies don&#39;t want a cure for diabetes, shure they could make money on the actual cure, but then they would loose all that stedy income from all the things listed above that their selling us...  So if a cure is gonna happen, i doubt it will be funded by them.Bernie Sanders Campaign ad, Brought to you by Joe Rogan.Joe Rogan podcast is 1000000000000 times better than any late night talk show in tv. Fucking love this podcast and the guests who come on .Every time I watch a YouTube video there’s a bullshit ad lying about how bad Medicare for all would be. I’m smart enough to know it’s a lie but there must be people who see it and don’t know. Pisses me off so muchBernie needs to get over the fact woman couldn&#39;t vote 100 years ago....he was only like 9 years old at the time.Bernie should hit the bluntmehGreat interviewResubscribing after 2 years thanks to this interview. Americans, please elect Bernie, he&#39;s the best politician you&#39;ve had in decades, don&#39;t screw this up.Smart man getting on JRE...I dont think people realise the power of this alternative mediaNo fucking wayI&#39;m so glad that Bernie brought up the topic of being scared and frightened to be at school, thankfully I just graduated so I don&#39;t have to go back but I feel for all the students that have to. It might not be a constant thought that&#39;s in our heads all the time but having that thought to be put there in the first place is something that should have never have happened.Bernie: ban assault weapons<br /><br />All those legally owned would be grandfathered in, so they would still be there.<br /><br />Bernie: expand background checks so we know who has mental health issues.<br /><br />LOL! A background check would only provide that info if a court orders it. And since we have shit healthcare, there are very few ppl getting help.<br /><br />Bernie: these gun manufacturers share some responsibility.<br /><br />So he is parroting Hillary Clinton, whose plan was to put gun manufacturers out of business by imposing manufacturer liability and allowing endless frivolous lawsuits. But by all means, don&#39;t follow the same logic in regards to pharmaceutical opioids or drunk driving claims against Coors and Ford. 🙄Bernie is a good and consistent man. Too old for me to vote for him tho YANG GANGWowo, I actually stand with Bernie on the healthcare issue.. FUCK big pharmaAlmost 500K views in less than 6 hours. I can&#39;t thank you enough Joe for your platform. Sanders/Gabbard 2020.1st vote is Yang but it won&#39;t happen this election season so Bernie is a good 2nd choice.I have a lot to say but I’ll limit it to this:  we are the richest and greatest country in the history of mankind,  we could do so much better and it’s sad that we don’t.If they stop selling and making big guns Mexico will sell and find a maker from another country to get em here like there drugs.. then Democrats will be building the rest of the wallBernie lost my vote when he said &quot;When you&#39;re white ... you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor.&quot;    I remember living in women&#39;s shelters or my mothers car for the first 12 years of my life.  To this day I hate feeling really hungry because it brings me back to my childhood.  I had no change of clothes and was made fun of because I smelt bad in school.  CPS took me from my mother when I was 12 and put me in a transition home until I was 18.  Eventually as an adult I was able to earn good money through working my way up in construction.  But don&#39;t tell me I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor because i&#39;m white, that&#39;s fuckin bullshit.Don’t ban semi automatic weapons .Bernie “I talked to a guy just the other day” sanderslol &quot;President Bernie&quot;This is what should be on CNN, MSMBC, FOX etc. These are the most unbiased, straight questions and answers I&#39;ve ever seen involving any politics. Finally a REAL interview with a politician. Joe can help change America.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also<br /><br />Why didn&#39;t they Bernie up some joints??Get OBAMA on here!!! 🙏👌If only we could take that trillion dollars the Pentagon lost and put it towards the people.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=38m20s">38:20</a> NZ Government is still going to have massive troubles with their proposed buyback and related legislation, it&#39;s not just as easy as the media make it out to be.Bernie should really promote and talk a lot more on platforms. More than Trump. Especially Twitter and Facebook since it was the driving force for Trump on winning the election. Which I do remember Hilary did get the popular vote, but Trump did use these platforms strategically despite him being a troll through it all.&quot;government took over education through 12th grade and now that&#39;s not enough, we need to take over through college&quot; (approximate quote). What happens when that&#39;s not enough? Why should I support my tax dollars going to go to supporting a bunch of college students living on their own instead of at home on their parents dime? Expand high school education for kids through 21 to take higher level classes and see what middle class parents are still ok with the idea of &quot;free public education&quot;Some scientists say the heat is coming from the center of the earth and from the cosmos.He talks so big in reference to canada&#39;s health care system and how great it is LOL <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/national/ian-mulgrew-health-care-collapse-predicted-in-canada">https://vancouversun.com/news/national/ian-mulgrew-health-care-collapse-predicted-in-canada</a>I wonder if he&#39;ll get trump on here. If trump were smart he would...he would probably do his shtick he always does, but I would like to hear him in a long form setting.I completely disagree with Sanders, but this interview was fascinating. We never get to see long form discussions of their beliefs. This interview, and Ben Shapiro&#39;s interview with Andrew Yang were great. I wish the candidates would start having more long form discussions like thisBullshit that it&#39;s 1hr. They both should have rescheduled to make it at least 10hrs 😡He had me all the way till he said to surrender assault weapons. No no no. You sir lost my vote. Find another way.Wow it was so nice to be able to hear Bernie’s genuine first hand answers, he knows his stuff and can really articulate his plans of action. I gained a new perspective for this candidate through this medium, thanks joe.This is gonna be good....Joe says that in 3 hours you can find out if the person is full of shit through conversation, most of the questions were not answered here, &quot; you are raising a deep question&quot;. <br /><br /><br />As for his plan for corporations paying faire share, sure man, go ahead become president, which you wont, implement you&#39;re plan and watch the middle pay for everything. BC the rich will move to those parts of the world where governments  will welcome them with open arms!Its like Bernie said, greed. Greed drives everything.Wonder which mansion berney will be staying in after the showI definitely lean more conservative, but this is a good move. Actually sitting down and rationalizing a position is a lot better than broadcasting the cliff-notes on a three minute TV segment.JOE, Thanks. Please have more candidates on your channel. This is a service to a country that affords you the rights to do what you want. It is a very small portion of your time that can benefit literally BILLIONS of souls. Again Thanks.Bernie: I want to make healthcare free, education free...<br /><br />Joe: What about <b>DMT?</b>Awesome conversation!! Thank you Joe Rogan!!! <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Wait he says pharmaceutic company put the bulk of their money to control society but I said previously that they used 4.5 billion$ for that in 20 years which is under 300million a years, and that they made 70ish billion dollars in a years so 300 millions is the bulk of 70 billion? I don&#39;t know math anymoreI think I found out what is different about Bernie. He&#39;s not sketchy AFNaaaah sorry Bernie, in Merica we only have money for BS fake wars like Iraq to the tube of $4+ Trillion. Healthcare for Americans ? Fuck that we&#39;re rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan after we nearly destroyed them.I like to imagine Bernie and Joe smoked a joint before this episodeIslam is the truth<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m17s">23:17</a> well said Bernie.I doubt that would help the issue with assault rifles . But everything else I agree onNot a fan of Sanders but kudos to him for sitting down with Joe.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=16m59s">16:59</a> the million dollar question... fkn love you Joe Rogan&quot;Take my clothes off.&quot; Was that a jab at Andrew Yang when he pointed out how ridiculous MSM was being for focusing his lack of a tie?Which of you is ready to bring home far less of your paycheck in order to make his plans financially feasible?  Are you ready to pay for strangers college education and healthcare?  Do not fall for this repackaged socialism.  Learn from history.This fucking fool. Fuck him and anyone who supports himSocialism is A &amp; B decide what C shall do for D, Expect that they take a little bit of commission off on the way. - Milton FriedmanWhen the cameras went off you know they hit that blunt boiiiiiiYou really need to dig harder into these politicians joe. I&#39;m only 15 minutes in but you seem to just be having a casual conversation... go after these people to see if they think the insane things that they sometimes say they do to appease certain groups of people.I have a feeling he is talking about a style of weapons ban just to get votes, no one reasonable would think that suck thing is possible nor effective in many way...Main point is Bernie can’t do it alone. Media is brainwashing everyone. Money is power and it’s taking over our brains and society.I’m a firm conservative but I really appreciate you letting others come on and speak their mind and to have a fluid discussion. Respect.Yang is still my favorite. But Mr Sanders you have my respect for getting on for an hour and talking to Joe Rogan for an hour.No policy answers after 100yrs in Congress? This guy&#39;s a joke.Bernie&#39;s posture stinksHow can anyone not be for this man to be president??? I just dont get it... theres not enough billionaires voting so why aren&#39;t people voting for there own benefit and the benefit of other Americans especially kids and elders...Wheres alex jones when u need him.The hurdle is that it doesnt workThe man couldn’t even pay his own fifteen an hour lmao, told them to work less hours when they asked to be payed properly. This man doesn’t careTake away Joe and this just sounds like a rally with the volume down a few notchesThat time when Bernie forgot who we fought in the Pacific during WWll.Get trump lolWhen Bernie says &quot;every other country in the world negotiates with drug companies&quot; he means &quot;two other countries negotiate with drug companies&quot;love it!!I&#39;m 17 and i work and live on my own and <br /> live on 7.25 and i am doing greatI love how when speaking about the shooting in Dayton, Bernie and Joe never bring up the fact that local law enforcement and Bellbrook Highschool 100% failed us, they ignored the tell tale signs of a violent potentially dangerous individual. Students had complained to local Dayton authorities and Bellbrook highschool multiple times about Connor Betts being violent and his RAPE AND KILL LISTS. The highschool allowed Connor Betts to go through ROTC military training, which shows you how to wield an assault weapon in military style. The entire school was NOT SURPRISED that he was the shooter. Americas main problem is not only guns, its authority and our schools not taking action when it needs to be taken and allowing such OBVIOUS signs go unnoticed. Costing lives. Dayton was preventable. So fucking preventable.Thanks joe. You need to have a dem debate on your show.90 000 dead last year south if El Paso... those Mexican citizens killed .. were not killed by white men.. so I guess those deaths dont natter.  Bernie is a communist  joke.  Communism killed 100 million  people  last century.  <br />  Government kills more people than the plague every year.  Bernie I&#39;s a sad old joke.No policy answers after 100yrs in Congress? This guy&#39;s a joke.Thank you Joe. I am huge Bernie fan since 2015. Came to watch your podcast because you invited Bernie ❤️Im a conservative,  and i believe this is a good thing, we dont believe anyone should be silenced.  With that being said. Fuck Bernie lolBernie 2020!!🔥🔥💪go Bernie<br /><br /><br />Let the fooled feel the burn of 95% taxes, they will become woke as they loose everything in their life(homes, health care, food, etc)At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=6m30s">6:30</a> ask him how he&#39;s gonna pay for it Joe!Why raise taxes on the middle/lower class when you can get there from just raising taxes on the super wealthy and cutting the military budget? We are human beings not serfs. To say we want healthcare and a liveable wage is not a radical thing, it&#39;s a moral thing.This could literally be that air time for every candidate including the sitting president to voice their opinions and policies. You have enough of a diverse audience and guests to make it fair and welcoming. Please. This is the one trusted unbiased platform out there and you should consider it a duty to the American people.Socialism is evil.Nice to hear Bernie talk for once.   I think that should be about that for his chances however. It&#39;s one thing to say this is bad and this should be better, anyone can do that, having an actual plan to do it is another matter. What he proposed is not workable to the point of delusion. Love Joe for having this great platformA relatively profound Presidential candidate  interview. Historical for the internet social media. Many very good questions asked respectfully. An excellent means to humanize a politician and show respect for the serious national issues.<br /><br />Appreciate follow up questions but I imagine conditions are placed on the interview before it&#39;s agreed t o take place. I imagine in part that&#39;s why certain questions may have been off the table.<br /><br />Great effort!!Bernie seems like a cool ass dude. I&#39;d have a beer with him any day. But unfortunately I wouldn&#39;t trust him to run a lemonade stand.imagine if trump got on this podcast lolAlcohol is literally <a href="http://poison.no/">poison.no</a> health benefitsIf the minimum wage is raised to $15/hr more people will lose their jobs than benefit from the increase. Said every business owner I knowSanders is now trumps biggest opponent all thanks to joe Rogan. If hes fair lets see trump on here if rogans unbias.Let&#39;s fight against corruption in politics in this countryWhy is no one campaigning for the in-cell vote. We are many in number but our meetings are shitNice of Joe to have Larry David on the podcast!This was a fantastic interview. Joe you did a great job of letting Bernie speak and clarifying certain ideas and situations without talking down or over him.<br />Well doneNone of Bernie&#39;s propositions are financially feasible <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23changemymind">#changemymind</a>I thought Bernie was an old communist I am happy that I changed my outlook on him but I&#39;ll vote for him if yang or gabbard doesn&#39;t make itTulsi for president.They guarantee healthcare for  whom they seem worthy for treatment. This is starting to happen in USA already.Way to sell out Joe and not ask the tough questionsJoe always finds common ground with his guests, while still keeping his own identity, and i respect that a lot. This is honestly how news should be.Big get, niceNut. Job. Commie. Idiot.Should have done the world a favor and snuffed that bitch415k in less than a day and it’s not trending?Bernie, the things you wanna do to medicare based on hpw our economy is behaving will not be done in 4 years. 8-12 years is more reasonable and I&#39;m all for sticking it to those greedy pharmaceutical fucks but the way we get it done doesn&#39;t get done within 1 term.Very cool for Bernie to do the podcast. Thanks for taking the time old man, but I still don’t want you to winAnd then he lies about illegally purchasing firearms at a gun store, pretending its legal now. All purchases of guns by a vender in America are required to be a federally licensed firearms dealer and do background checks. What is his purpose in lying? Ask yourself that.This interview helped me realize what kind of a fucked up country we live in, and the mix of terrible problems we have no real solutions for. I’m not saying Bernie would save America, but he seems like he could use his reasoning to steer us in the right direction.Not even american, but damn this is a Good interview. <br />Also, it&#39;s me or every single one of bernie proposals implies taking other peoples money and do what he thinks is Best with it? Every single one of them.I love Joe Rogan. He is what Dave Rubin tried and failed to be. This is how you discuss &quot;ideas&quot;. He brings on liberals and conservatives equally and engages with both very well.<b>Also, according to the CDC, Alcohol kills more people than Guns.</b>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to get hate. Bernie didn&#39;t have a full time job until he was in his 40s when he ran for public office. Somehow he&#39;s become a multimillionaire on his public servant salary. He was blatantly cheated in the 2016 DNC primary and then turned around and campaigned for those who cheated him. Bernie is just another corrupt politician who&#39;s never accomplished anything but spend taxpayer $s. Trump has his own issues. Wake up people, we don&#39;t need more life long politiciansIs America ready for the first president with no neck?Gun show loophole doesn’t exist u have to go threw a background check then it needs to be mailed to a gun shop near u then they look into u and do paperwork firstBernie owns more than 1home, guess what?you&#39;re part of the 1%lolevery candidate should do an interview with JRE to give the ppl the info they need to make the right choiceThis was right up there with Tulsi&#39;s interview. I think they should join together, don&#39;t care what one is president or vice, but a Tulsi/Bernie campaign would probably have the best chance!<br /><br />He is also right, it isn&#39;t just about legalizing the drugs, its figuring out why so many people think they NEED them to drown out a normal happy life. If you feel you have to smoke pot every day then there is something wrong with your life more than just your addiction to that drug. We need to fix those problems more than we need to &quot;legalize everything&quot;. Its only going to hurt the poor communities more, the ones who are out there spending most of their small wages, just to get high/drunk as often as possible, we have to make their lives worth living without drugs/alcohol so they can get out of the impoverished situations they live in, so they can see hope beyond smoking/drinking their lives away.He’s not joking when he says childcare workers make starvation wages. Years ago I was a daycare worker and had 2 other jobs. I lived in a small apartment, no children, no car payment, minimal lifestyle. I remember having to pay for gas in change to get to work. One time I had to look in my car for change to get a box of macaroni because I was so hungry.Thank you for this interview JRE. Ol man Sanders got my vote🤙Young Jamie, y’all need to have Mike Rowe on. Such a stand up guy whose saying the right things when it comes to college debt.Hard not to like this guy. Wouldn’t vote for him, but we alllll feel the Bern just a little bit amirite.“The DNC wants to give everyone a chance” LOLThis is America and we are not going to be like other shit hole country&#39;s tell the truth more people die with free healthcare jagoffI don&#39;t agree with having drills when it comes to school shootings.  To put yourself in a killers mindset, think; easiest way to kill as many people as I can, as quick as I can before I get caught..  A drill is gonna show a killer exactly what&#39;s gonna happen and where everyone is gonna go, which is gonna make it easier for a school shooter to figure out how to break into classrooms and give them an estimate of time it would take before full lockdown initiates.Why only 1 hour? cmon get him back!You just gotta bring aliens into this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m00s">1:07:00</a>never heard bernie speak so softlyTypical socialist trying to paint there money source in a evil tone.  Wall Street speculation turns out to be people who invest in stocks.  1/2 of a percent works out to be $50 off a $10000 investment despite if you make or lose money.  What will happen is it will increase taxes on a person trying to save for retirement.  So his plan will make it difficult for people to trade for a living, save for retirement, and start up companies to raise capital.  All for people who do not want to pay for their education.NopeFinally I got to listen to Bernie in a non circus media setting. It would be great for all the candidates on both sides to be on your show. Joe you are the right person to conduct these interviews.Mandatory death penalty for mass shooters. Financial penalties to the estateJoes trying to set the record for most interviews of losing candidatesbruh...USA USA USAIm a canadian, just saying...our best doctors leave to the u.s because they can make more money. So hes full of crap.Is this Rogan’s way to Casey Neistat his stance?Like the video if you like it, please. Dislike it if you dont, please. We live in a world where these platforms can be taken seriously!Now have Trump on!Disagree 100% with Bernie, but glad he is on.I&#39;m to the right(not for everything) but I&#39;m glad Joe has done this, good to hear points uninterrupted, dynamic views on policy.I&#39;m voting for Bernie so hard.What are assault weapons??? I was with you up until this.Whyvdo we reley on one person to make all of our laws?  Why dont they put new possibly laws on voting ballet and let the people decide.   Some tired of people like him thinking they dictate everyone. <br /> Focus on treating people right<br />Tacal mental health, start helping people that make mistakes not giving them a record and charging them for ruining there lives.  Just look at our prisons we incarcerate murders and rapists instead of killing them.  Then we send people to jail with them for low level mistakes and think there going to be great citizens whenbthey get out with their new criminal education <br />Really have a hard time believing any of these politicians.  <br />Show compassion , empathize  learn to truely care about others and America will thriveRegarding the tax cuts &quot;83% of the tax goes to the one percent&quot;<br />First off, having less stolen from you does not mean anything is going to you. If your neighbors house was robbed and yours wasn&#39;t, you didn&#39;t get anything. Even if it was proportional, the 1% produce 83%+ of the value so a fair tax would be proportional. Pareto principle. I don&#39;t care how much anyone else is taxed, I am only against the idea that anyone is taxed. Further all taxes are regressive, businesses pass on all expenses as higher prices (healthcare) or lower wages (laborer), depending on elasticity of the good they are selling. I begrudge no one for protecting what is rightfully theirs from the wicked tax man.This is really smart. A long conversation so people can easily study and observe the candidate&#39;s thoughts and ideas. Yang and Tulsi did it, the rest of the pack need to catch on too.older people vote and a lot watch tv. younger people often don&#39;t vote.K<br />I like him but he needs a glam squad and not a femme glam squad a butch one.... lmao!!<br />I can&#39;t take that hair and eyebrows...lmao!!! <br />Pinche! Bernie.  Good luck manIs it only an hour long because Bernie had to be in bed by 8?Democratic socialism only means you get to vote in the tyrant that is going to shake you down for your material wealth and health.Trump came to Kentucky to rally....Joe Rogan is one of the only if not the only YouTuber who is actually changing the world in a huge way keep it up Joe 👏Imagine if joe Rogan had Donald trump on 4 years agoI like when Joe has politicians on but I wish he would challenge some of the underlying premises.  I want these politicians to have to answer hard questions.  Questions from someone who has researched the topics that are likely to be brought up by the candidate.  Just letting them spew their rhetoric without challenge is not very helpful.  <br /><br /><br />Also, Bernie has no chance of being the candidate to oppose Trump.  The DNC will ensure that.Lol, socialist cuuuuuntThis guy has never run a business. He&#39;s a straight up communist. Who honeymoons in Moscow in the 80s?  Seriously....fuck this guy. So over this leftist socialism infecting our republic. <br /><br />Joe is not asking the tough questions. This is pathetic.For the love of god pls let him win the Presidency in 2020! /begsHoly shit...Compare this with the Andrew yang interview. Huge differencejoe asked that alien question at the end like he already knows something that sanders knowsJoe rogan hosting fear factor again, that is America.Wait.... he stated he had to lay off some his staff to pay them his 15 n hr junk🤔🤔 for his campaign.... so why would that no apply to the rest of America??🤔🤔Free, free, free, free...I once saw Bernie drinking a bottle of ranch dressing ranch... odd but trueI think banning assault weapons won&#39;t help but harm instead. fixing the economy for the people will help people not be so frustrated and hopeless about their lives. ask the slave if taking his shank away will make him happy. let him go free and help him on his feet and u may have a friend for life instead of a shooter. they kno u well enuff that they can allow u to be &quot;president&quot; because u are tricked to take the peoples protection away.Can  somebody get my man Bernie a glass of water&quot;Marijuana ain&#39;t heroin!&quot;- Bernie Sandersthis made me stan bernieAfter the fall of communism in Soviet Russia, the whole world witnessed the evils of the collecvist ideology. All around the world, people were now aware that socialism brings nothing but economic collapse, misery, famine and death. Such horrors were the result of central planning of the economy and the foolish notion that government knows best. Socialism has failed everywhere inthe world it has been tried, with Venezuela being the latest example of how cancerous an ideology socialism is.<br /><br />This is why socialists resort to euphemisms and semantics in order to advance their agenda, no rational human being would vote for a socialist. So they portray themselves as &quot;humanists,&quot; &quot; egalitarians,&quot; and &quot;environmentalists&quot; etc etc. They cannot defend the merits of their ideas, so they demonize anyone who dares to challenge their ideas.<br /> <br />Socialists fail to realize that wealth can be created. And the creation of wealth cannot be achieved without one crucial thing: human capital.<br /><br />And human capital, my friends, cannot be confiscated and redistributed.<br />Sender&#39;s is a nut job who should pack it in and call it a day. The entire Democrat party should, too.I woulda liked to hear his thoughts on what the DNC did to him last timeImagine a warm summer night. It&#39;s mid-July 2016 around 3 a.m. when Jane was startled awake by the sound of a person moving through her bedroom.<br /><br />Chills ran through her as she confirms with her left hand that her husband is indeed asleep next to her while footsteps are crossing the room.<br /><br />Security has never entered the room unannounced before. Still, Jane rationalizes it must be one of them, and it must be serious.<br /><br />She nudges her husband awake and reaches for the light. &quot;Bernie! Someone is in the room!&quot; she shouts as she fumbles for the switch of her bedside lamp.<br /><br />The light floods the room. Bernie had been sleeping very deeply and was still trying to push back the fog as he processed Jane&#39;s words, and the alarm in her voice, and this man standing at the foot of the bed.<br /><br />&quot;Security!&quot; Bernie shouts, half grumbly. &quot;Security!&quot; More loudly and more clear this time.<br /><br />The man laughs, and screams &quot;Security!&quot; &quot;Security!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They&#39;re not coming, Bernie. But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not here to hurt anyone tonight. I&#39;m just here to ask you to support Hillary.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Who the hell are you! How did you get in here?&quot; Bernie replied.<br /><br />&quot;Look. To be fair. I&#39;m not just asking. I am insisting. So be smart Bernie, and save yourself, and those you love, a lot of grief.&quot; The man said as he leaned in close making his face clearly visible. Piercing blue eyes accented with deep-set lines that etched an almost permanent serious expression on the man&#39;s face.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;ll see you in Philly.&quot; the man said, as he pulled back. And without another word he turned and walked calmly out of the room.&lt;3Holy fuck almost dropped my iPad when I saw he was on this show. Love Bernie just not the policy.Joe Rogan is Jewish so of course he would have Bernie onHe makes some fair points but he really likes to tell stories of talking to others. How can someone on the campaign trail talk to so many.To all the Trumptards making shit up or saying shit without thinking with a lick of common sense, suck my left nut lol 😂😂😂Bernie... Sir you better not renege on telling us about aliens!This is one of the major reasons I listen to Joe Rogan...Thank-you Joe.It is so refreshing to get to solutions presented in long form rather than a glorified reality TV show designed to feed the news cycle with sound bites and expensive commercial time. There’s some people that seem like they genuinely care on the Democratic side this year and that really gives me hope.Only sensical politician. The corrupt system and corporate democrats don&#39;t want bernie!!little does joe know, he&#39;s exactly the kinda person that bernie wants to steal money from:&#39;) I can die happy nowI have been a Bernie Supporter since the last election but I think I like Andrew Yangs solutions a little more than BerniesWhile I appreciate the long form platform that Joe gives to Bernie, I wish it was more of a conversation between the two. It was just Joe asking a question and then Bernie answering without much follow-up/discussion.Sorry Joe but were now gonna need a JRE Political series...This will be the LAST JRE ever!Exited to hear what this idiot has to say.Move over Trumptards!!! Big daddy Bernie’s coming for those cheeks!&quot;It&#39;s a reality TV show.&quot; Hmmm... where have I heard that before? Oh that&#39;s right. Andrew Yang said it during the debates.I&#39;m from the UK so please don&#39;t hold me to this but I believe the US system also creates 90% of all medical innovation and we just buy the formulas from us companies in bulk. I&#39;m sure the US could create healthcare unions for that second part that acts in the same way without the individual insurance systemBernie.  I have the utmost appreciation for your moral compass and your leadership and courage in seeing the &quot;urgency&quot; of now.  However, as a supporter of your strength and courage, I have to thank you for your ultimate message of wisdom in gathering together, organizing,  and rising up with the immediate solutions of the FREEDOM DIVIDEND.  It should have been in place since the 80s but here we are, finally at the end of the line in this silly game of poker.  I was saddened to hear you lob softballs in Yangs direction like you did in this interview but I took solace in understanding that your message of wisdom is being embraced.  The urgent moment of now is solving problems within the constraints of this mess and nothing else brings power back to the people more than UBI.  Personally, I can&#39;t wait to get rid of our politicians with blockchain representation and put government employees back to work for the government, but I digress.  Sorry we have to part ways, thank you again for having the courage when others didn&#39;t and please know your wisdom and courage will carry on long after you.Hold on, in Canada, our health care system is a federal and provincial partnership. From what I understand, the federal government negotiates with Big Pharma for medication and reasonable rates because it is the largest guaranteed client. The provinces, our version of states, administer the delivery of health care. It&#39;s not really a single-payer system. If you&#39;re in your domicile province for 153 days or more, you are eligible for healthcare otherwise, you are so out of luck. And don&#39;t get sick out of your province otherwise, it can still cost you thousands of dollars. Your domicile province might cover those out of province expenses, but there is no guarantee. In summary, our healthcare system has some serious holes in it.Feel the burn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂Assault gun could u be more vage old man lose his head if u all want hep and no food vote for the burnThere goes Rogan being told what to do and pushing forward this disgusting clown who should be running a pastrami sandwich shop in Crown Heights...what a jokeSo many dumbasses railing against Bernie on here... Literally NO ONE commenting here is part of the club. Bernie is on your side, but you&#39;re too stupid to see it.Joe: “Do you have any realistic, creative solutions to these complex, modern issues?”<br /><br />Bernie: “That’s not possible, sir.”<br /><br />Joe: “I beg to differ. Andrew Yang accomplished that feat no more than an hour ago...”Let&#39;s not ask any questions about what would happen to your income tax if this senile grump gets voted in there Joe Joe lmao 50%.. 60%???Bernie you old son a bitch you just pulled a trump supporter! You seem like a fantastic choice for President, thanks for doing the show 😎Albanian-American here. My family had to escape the death grip of Enver Hoxha the communist/socialist darling of Albania for about 50 years. Intellectuals killed, party favorites got the jobs and school positions while the worthy were banished or worse. My family came to this great country to escape that misery and decide our own fate with sweat, blood and tears. The US has many issues, no question. But Americans will never sell out to this failure who didn’t even have the backbone to call out Hillary and the DNC! Socialist/communist snake, made his career in a 90% white gun loving state and now wants to tell the whole country socialism will work? Disturbing how many morons in the comment section are so historically ignorant of the human suffering at the hands of Bernie’s ideasHoly shit I don&#39;t like Bernie but I&#39;ve never clicked so fast8.1k people that downvoted this video are cucksWhat if soneone makes 15 an hour now for a more skilled job. If minimum wage is raised to 15 how does that affect the people who have worked their way up a little from the bottom? Do they get a raise? Or do people walking off the street to flip burgers make the same as them now?The DNC ramping up propaganda ahead of their 2020 &quot;oppression election&quot;<br />P.S.; Keep up the anti White sentiment- that&#39;s a winning strategy 👌Bernie2020!! Thank you Joe for having him on your show.I lean right and I thought (thanks to the media) Sanders was a crazy old coot. I have a new respect for him after watching this interview. Thanks Joe!I have just gained a lot of respect for bernie with this move. Hopefully long-form interviews become the new campaign method for politicians.“Military style rifles” or  “assault weapon” is all you need to hear to know you are not talking with an informed or honest person.I can’t listen to this moronOh fuckbernie completely sidetracked how he would implement the assault weapon ban... disappointed that joe didnt push a bit harder on it.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/foxandfriends/videos/902187103472157/">https://www.facebook.com/foxandfriends/videos/902187103472157/</a>YesssssssHahahaha! Joe couldn&#39;t help but think ask about aliens hahahaSome great ideas dealing with the pharmaceutical industry, lengthened candidate responses, college debt, and the fact that time and equality mean more in the workplace. <br />BUT a government &#39;giving&#39; money to anyone comes from 1 of 3 places.<br /> 1. War.<br /> 2: A taxpayer (oppression). <br /> 3: The government (printing or debasing money)<br /> The choices are to reject the fight, excess &amp; unfair taxes, or a slow Roman decline from the inside respecfully. Oppression is the easiest to overcome, as long as you can defend yourself and the country against those that choose war- at any level. You can&#39;t stop guns, it&#39;s too late without war, and we will see cyber attacks more devastating than any mass shooter. I&#39;m still waiting for that candidate. Definately an ok debate... but flawed at the most basic level. Please lmk if you disagree.You should get more politicians on like ted cruz or  dan crenshawHell yes my 2 favorite people.@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m40s">27:40</a> Bernie Fails to pinpoint the real reason College tuition has skyrocketed. That reason is government backed student loans. It&#39;s not just higher education that&#39;s being affected it&#39;s Medical care and Housing. People think MORE government is the solution, turns out it&#39;s the crux of the problem!What a moron this guy is a hack and anyone with half a brain knows it3 democrat candidates and still hasnt put a republican on.lil bit biased.I literally yelled “Holy shit he got Bernie on”If you turn the captions on you&#39;ll see excerpt words of context removed from the narrative.Joe &quot;Larry King&quot; Rogan.Who else is tryna find the Elon Musk commentBernie Sanders is a treasonous,Communist and a traitor!!! Joe Rogan is a dope head hippie!Burning Sandals!&quot;IT&#39;S LEGAL BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS!&quot; &quot;THEY&quot; sure do, &quot;THEY&quot; sure do...Someone tell Bernie I know tons of heroin addicts.. many who lost their lives... who came from nice families, had money, access to jobs, had health insurance.... and they still couldn’t beat it. It’s not that Fucking simple Bernie.I&#39;d choose Trump over Bernie, but THIS is why the mainstream media can go fuck themselves. A dopehead standup comedian can offer us something those dipshits never can: An hour of sincere discussion on pressing social issues.When the American people go to polls and vote could they please just put on the ballot &quot;Do you want free healthcare?&quot; If so, vote Burnie Sanders.<br /><br />Im not even American and yet I truly believe All Americans deserve free healthcare. All humans for that matter.Comrade Bernie wants communism lite.Everyone has a entitlement to their own opinion in the USA but the people on this wackos side are honestly shocking and the lefts views on this country are almost as dangerous as the Nazis were. They preach propaganda against whites and have stirred the black and Hispanic people into immense hatred against the whites (While Donald Trump has actually gotten massive reforms completed and made black unemployment close to extinct) so basically whenever I hear someone from the left I truly question why they speak as if they are higher beings trying to manipulate the “weak” when they realize black and Hispanics are only viewed as equal to us the left makes them “weak” by acting like if they were oppressed! This cannot happen in American politics anymore and it’s not that I support Trump to why I hate the left but it’s just damn near embarrassing they can call people Nazis and calling 9/11 nothing and promoting terrorist shootings although the last shooter was a registered Democrat! It’s a joke and Bernie is trying to manipulate the young black and Hispanic Americans to his side by feeding them lies but we’ll see in 2020 WE WILL SEE BERNIE BEST OF LUCK YOU ARE GOING TO NEED ITMilk and the concept of time have been deemed racist. So I&#39;ll be God dammed if I listen to a lying politician on your podcast. You have strayed from what made this am excellent podcast. Now your just a YouTube ad whore.Ok, but why is he so angry that Amazon doesn&#39;t pay taxes? Why would they do it? Did they get their money from the state? Haven&#39;t they contributed to American society to become better? Here, in Brazil, they offer the same service as some locals as &quot;Submarino&quot; but by a lower price so we expend less money and that&#39;s really better because we can buy and do more things. How isn&#39;t their service in the benefit of society?Why are Sanders and Biden still doing politics at their age?All I hear is more taxes here and more taxes there; free this there, free shit EVERYWHERE!I am not a Bernie fan. But if you’ve disliked this video because you hate Bernie and not because Joe did a bad interview (I’ve yet to watch the video) then seriously fuck off.bernie knows why iam pissed off all the time, fuck insurance companies, fuck pharmaceutical industry and fuck these so called AMERICAN companies building shit in other countriesDefranco 2024As a conservative, (yeah I know boo all you want. I get it all the time), I have never been a fan of Sanders but I always appreciate these candid discussions with politicians so you can see a more human side of them. I just wish there would be more representation from the conservative sideI literally didn&#39;t know Joe was this uninformed. Taxing corporations wont even touch the costs of what this crazy asshole is proposing!!!!!Look, clearly, this man is still one sharp mother f-...  Imagine how much good he can do in 4 years!i like Bernie as a person. he seems like a genuine person that you’d want as a neighbor. i just don’t know how i feel about his politics.I went to a Bernie rally in Kissimmee Florida 2016. It was like a rock concert, high energy and everyone on the same vibe TOGETHER. Much different than a Trump rally where everyone is terrified and angry.Bernie has a good heart and cares about the American people however his ideas are outdated Bernie dosen&#39;t have all of the answers but yang does. Let&#39;s look at a $15 minimum wage it sounds great only unlike the freedom dividend it will not grow small business but make people not be able to pay for employees and therefore shut down there business.  Not to mention the businesses that survive like McDonald&#39;s etc. Will pay you $15 a hour but you will also see mcchickens go up to $5 from $1 seriously.  Yang&#39;s dividend is a way more reasonable way to end the wage gap I wish Bernie would have been asked his thoughts on Andrew yang&#39;s policy.Listen, Bernie bros, please. All I want is to be left alone. You’re not entitled to my money, or anyone richer than me’s money. I would never advocate anyone robbing you, so please don’t advocate anyone robbing me.Long live bernieDam, I was with him until he started talking about banning &quot;assault weapons&quot;This is great, I&#39;d like to see all the other candidates come on and explain their positions as well.Billionaires are not greedy. <br />They become billionaires by identifying what people want and providing it for them. <br />Trade unions are greedy. <br />People are compelled to pay union dues. That&#39;s how they make money - ostensibly at gun point.What&#39;s this sensation I feel? It&#39;s like... I&#39;m feeling the Bern.You picked the wrong one! ...... A Canadian.Joe, all these people in the comments want some of your money. You&#39;re a millionaire bro. You need to be paying for other peoples abortions, sex changes, and cheeseburger clogged heart surgeries because you have way too much money. The only reason you have that money is because of your white male privilege.OHHHHH SHITTTTTTT THIS IS MY FAVORITE FUCKING CROSSOVER EPISODE EVEROnly real pro labour candidate who cares about working people. Thank you for keeping us breathing above water all by yourself Bernie. God bless you.Please please please will the smart half of America get together and vote for this man, you have a chance to change the world for the better.Joe keeps bringing in people to talk highly about democratic socialism. and to the average person it puts out great logic and makes sense, but if you have more understanding of what it REALLY is, you will understand that socialism of ANY form DOES NOT WORK, EVER! Countries ALL over the world are failing&quot;Assault weapons&quot; is too vague. Does that mean any semi auto? just black guns? just guns that look a certain way? We already ban full auto and bump stocks. This has gone too far already.Latinos for Trump 2020 ! Keep hating on our president, baby :* and No ! We&#39;re not tired of winningBro did you just confuse NZ with Aus? :PWhy didn&#39;t he start out paying his campaign workers $15? He&#39;s such a fraud.Him alone winning the presidency is not enough. If he won the elections becomes the president, they&#39;re gonna cock block the hell out of him in Congress. You gotta have like minded people to go after the Republican and corporate Democrat senators seats as well.Bernie Sanders because hindsight is 2020.What a fucking moronI like that youve brought on so many losers that arnt going to win.Go Bernie Sanders!!!!This decrepit Jew disgusts mePretty pathetic you let him get away with that whole “assault style” weapon rhetoric. No talks of comparisons between hand guns vs rifles; hand guns kill more people per year than rifles FYI. Wish you would have challenged his ideas moreJoe can be wonderfully entertaining and gets great guests. This is Joe as a journalist. Thanks for being real. Props to Bernie for showing up.Burn one with bern!On todays show , &quot;lets talk politics&quot; with joe roganBernie or bust....wait...Bernie or Warren...and then bust.Look at all these punkass republican Trumpfucks disliking this,  bunch of bitchesTell that old jew to shut the fuck up and die already.Social Democracy for the Win! BERNIE 2020Bernie: 50 years ago college was virtually free.<br />Joe: how much is it now?<br />Bernie: I don&#39;t know. But it&#39;s a lot.<br />This is why I&#39;m in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>, politicians spouting out lines with no data to back it up.  Ask Yang and he&#39;ll give you the numbers and cite his sources.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m05s">27:05</a> a high school degree!? Don&#39;t try and church it up...Own a gun in case the people want to overturn the government for a revolution, so the country always belongs to the people.props to Joe. no where else can you find a full hour conversation with a presidential candidateI hate the guy but glad you had him on.As a Vermontian, I&#39;ve been long awaiting this podcast with beloved Bernie 4prez 2020!!!Go Bernie, Go JoeFor some one who has never worked a day in his life is a millionaire and has three homes he sure loves other countriesALL ABOARD THE BERNIE TRAIN BAYBEEEMy real issue with the Government handling healthcare is that the Government is extremely ineffective and inefficient at running businesses. The MAIN reason that healthcare costs so much right now is that healthcare is the collusion between government and big business.  I agree with Bernie on that fact but the way to correct the issue is NOT centralizing business. It is NOT providing free education. It is NOT $15 minimum wage. It is NOT Medicare for all.  If you look at student debt over the past 40 years, you see a significant increase in tuition directly tied to the Government&#39;s student loan program.  (Look up the article on Forbes).  I appreciate his passion on helping the working class but the way he wants to accomplish this feat will destroy this great nation.This motherfuckers shoulders are too high like he&#39;s been typing too much. I don&#39;t trust him, he was born in 1941... that&#39;s a lot of life without internetCorrect me if i am wrong but didnt Bernie just take alot of heat for not paying his campaign employees 15 minimum wage when they asked for it?Canada spends half of what the US spends...? They have only 35 million people and they ALREADY have reached HALF of the US’ non-universal healthcare spending amount? Am I misunderstanding something here?Wow, this is an amazing interview. I never took time to really listen to Bernie because there&#39;s no real long interview of him detailing his platform. But I think I fell in love with the manGood interview.  Only criticism would be, to challenge Bernie more.  When he rattled off stats, where did these come from? Most of these claims were not challenged and appear as accepted fact? Joe expanded and explored his ideas etc well, but he could have challenged him more imo.  Great job overall Joe. Bernie has good well meaning ideas, (some bat crap crazy too)  but all these things need to be paid for? Just saying we’ll tax the hell outta the top end won’t fix the problems, it will work short term, until the top end buggers off because they won’t pay these heightened costs.  You then run out of money, then voila, Venezuela.  If you want to convince people your socialist ideas are better, you need to show that it is SUSTAINABLE in the long term.I&#39;m voting for 4yrs Worth of Weekends at Bernie&#39;sROGAN 2020While I&#39;m not necessarily a fan of Bernie&#39;s, I absolutely love the fact that Joe is giving different types of politicians a platform to speak freely without all the biased media bull-shit! We need more of this.Socialism is for FAGSJoe should’ve cracked out old faithful like he did with Elon Musk.Sanders is a racist piece of shit.Get the mother fuckin money out of mother fuckin politics.  Period. Boycott the companies who are fucking us in the ass. 20 years ago we survived without Amazon and walmart etc. It&#39;s possible to survive with less conveniences. We have to do this or we will be stuck fucked forever. The time is NOW! Wake the fuck up. This is our country. Don&#39;t let a small percentage of greedy pricks dictate how we live in our own country. We actually have way more power than the top richest people.  We just don&#39;t use it. It&#39;s time to take the power back. Today. Don&#39;t think the next generation is going to fight for their freedoms. All generations have to flex.  It&#39;s 100% possible to take the power back.  You just have to believe we can. I believe we can.  Do you?I don’t agree with a lot of Bernie’s views and ideas but I do respect him from coming on and it was interesting to here his views nice and well spoken broken down. Even made me agree with him on a few. Love JREGreat interview! I am upset you didn&#39;t ask about immigration and ending the concentration camps, and dealing with white supremacists.Don’t agree with Bernie on most issues but mad respect for doing JRE. I enjoyed listening to another running politician get to actually SPEAK on issues of today.I&#39;m editing this comment so the replies don&#39;t make sense.Great podcast though! Rooting for Bernie! He got jipped last timeLets raise minimum wage so you can afford to live! <br /><br />.. But also raise your taxes!!Imagine if Alex Jones just came out from behind the curtain as a surprise guestBernie Sanders deserves the presidency.<br />America doesn&#39;t deserve Bernie<a href="http://richslavesapparel.com/">Richslavesapparel.com</a> loved this interview. Free ourselves of old dogmatic thinking. Make a change America needs it.Bernie!!!Joe, you of all people should know businesses do not pay tax. It is passed on to the end user of their product/service.Bernie talking to Joe about drugs is like me trying to talk about cars with my mechanic.Trump2020Great interview <br />Great hearing Bernie!<br />Love so much of what <br />Bernie has proposed <br />Good luck Bernie...Was enjoying it until he said &quot;climate change&quot; over 90% scientist say it&#39;s not a risk.JRE just broke the internetBernie fails to address the real reason for wealth inequality which is create by the Fed through inflation. People believe the Fed when they claim inflation is low, but the way the Fed calculates inflation is BS because they don&#39;t include asset price inflation, for example house prices. The Fed&#39;s CPI numbers are BS too because they don&#39;t include cost of food or energy. Bernie should be going after the Fed!Bernie - I&#39;ll put a ban on assault rifles<br /><br />Joe - How?<br /><br />Bernie - Well I dont have a magic wandYou maybe able to get “free heart surgery” in Canada, but you will be on a 6 month waiting list.suprised hillary face when i see my feedBernie&#39;s polling numbers have finally dropped low enough for him to go on JRE. Bernie just lumped himself in with Andrew Yang and Gabbard... Bernie is gonna have a lot of trouble getting past  Warren or Harris... let alone Biden. His polling numbers have been dropping like a stone since Warren has been taking chunks of support away from him...Democrats like Bernie want the fairness doctrine because they know who owns mainstream media.Street drugs are illegal and you can buy them anywhere!  I dont agree with you gun control concept.   It is crazy people that think taking another human being&#39;s life is acceptable.  In Montana, everyone has a gun.  There is very little crime.  I agree something needs to be done.  Joe should have given Mr Sanders a pot cookie and worked through this...listen to his sly talk &quot;3 people have more then the 99* apparently 3 people is 1% of 300,000,000+<br /><br /><br />3 people 1% lolHe&#39;s such a fucking dishonest piece of shit.  The entire interview was him telling half-truths.  Avoiding the actual issue with national healthcare, the cost to the taxpayer.  Avoiding the issues Canadians actually face with their healthcare system.  Ignoring the fact that there are tons of Canadians crossing the border to get treatment in cities like Buffalo because they can&#39;t be seen by a doctor.&quot;His friend Beto...&quot; I think he is already setting up for Bernie Beto 2020.Thank you for having BS on today. <br />Thank you, BS for your years running Government.<br /> In a race between BS and HC, take the Hair.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m30s">23:30</a><br />So the billionaires wanted to end slavery? Give women the right to vote. Integration. Give amnesty to undocumented migrants. Decriminalize marijuana. <br /><br />Damn, without the billionaires we would still have a divorce rate of the levels before 1700. Better go thank a billionaire.Radical geezer commie .... let&#39;s put him in charge.<br />This is gonna be great .Fans: Would it kill Bernie to do 3-4 hours like a goddamn normal guest?<br />Also fans: ProbablyHealth care will never be a human right just because you want it to be law...<b># 99.9963% of Guns in America NEVER murder anyone EVER</b><br /><b># 99.984% of Gun Owners in America NEVER murder anyone EVER</b><br /><b># 99.995% of AR-Style Gun NEVER murder anyone EVER</b><br /><b># You are more likely to die using your </b><b><i>Cell Phone</i></b><b> than you are to be murdered by a Rifle</b><br /><b># You are more likely to be </b><b><i>Struck By Lightning</i></b><b> than you are to be murdered by a Rifle</b>The socialist left will hand Trump the win in 2020.Joe’s a freaking genius! He is going to have all of the other politicians lining up to be on his show !&quot;De-regulated as much as possible so they can pollute our water, our air, our environment&quot;\<br />If it was deregulated as much as possible, there would be no such thing as &quot;our&quot; anything. Pollution is only a problem because there is not absolute deregulation. In a free society a polluter would be liable for damages to everyone downstream from them because there would be no such thing as &quot;public property&quot;. The state creates problems regarding the tragedy of the commons.If you think this retard can run the country you need to go to Canada and see how well they’re doingToe toe toe, why would you even for a second entertain the thoughts of this crazy bitter old socialist , who clearly has a comb phobia?I wanna see Alex Jones interview Bernie nextOk now I want Bernie to take his clothes off hahaha!Free DMT ice creamYang &gt; BernieHealthcare is literally gambling, it doesn’t matter whether or not it’s in the private or public sector. All I want is the right save money for a rainy day instead of gambling on getting sick.How bout instead of giving ppl money for showing up, you let them earn it when their work becomes increasingly productive. Why does  minimum wage need to riseOk joe, you got the big interview and spent months putting out half assed podcasts to reassure sanders PR people that you wont go live and wont show any youtube clips and are willing to cut things out and edit. Can we please get back to the legit JRE&#39;s now? thank you. Great interview by the way.Respect for coming on here...Joe&#39;s arm must be hurt from lobbing up those softballs  🥎i wish alex jones was on with bernie lolEliminate the FED and off shore accounts to dodge taxes.The USA will have no more debt.The paid downvote bots are going offJRE political debate needs to happen. Bernie vs Yang 2020man i would buy cable right now, if they had 2 hours a day of &quot;government&quot; tv with everything from city local to state to federal. like how many cable channels are there like 10? fuck youtube could fill those channels 10 times over every second. they should do something youtube could not.I hope these so called analysts from Fox, CNN and MSNBC see this so they can learn how an interview is suppose to be conducted.Joe Rogan &gt; Larry KingAs a conservative leaning independent I agree with pretty much everything except the last 7 or so minutes of the podcast. I didn&#39;t really care much for Bernie seeing him in the media but I understand now why so many that are close to him like him. He&#39;s very personable when he&#39;s not expected to give 30 second sound bytes.Bernie is your only hope if you truly want to regain your greatnessWhy do all the gun debates talk about humans as if they are one dimensional and static? If someone is emotionally stable now doesn’t mean that when their wife leaves them and gets  drunk they will be stable later. I love how the rhetoric is guns in a good guy’s hands are safe and bad in bad guy’s hands. These people behind these massacres weren’t born evil. The only way to stop is remove all the guns. It was done in Australia and the massacres stopped. All the conservatives complained at first but will never go back. No politician has the balls to do that in US.Sanders looks terrible with that sexual predator hair, he needs to just go fully baldJoe hunching like Bernie 🤣I came from reddit for the elon musk commentSo happy he finally got him on. It was only a matter of time. Love Burnie, feel how you feel he is the most consistent and honest politician we&#39;ve seen since our four fathers. That has to count for something. Forget what side you&#39;re on, bet on someone who actually cares about we the people. Stop picking people who care not for your needs but only theres. Stop picking candidates off perception vs realityTake away the tax breaks for companies and ya no what will happen. They won&#39;t be in America for long. They are in our country for a reason.You are the man joe. It’s sad that I learn more about candidates from you than television.This is up there with the interview you did with Cornel West but that ones my favorite of all time. This is better in some ways thonot a bernie supporter but I enjoyed this podcast! I wish the debates could be more long form or conversational, it really humanizes the candidates and shows off the strengths and weaknesses of their policyOk now bring some Republicans and some Green Party mother fuckers. Let’s get some varietyAs someone who has been critical of Joe in the recent few years, I have to say this might be one of the best podcasts he ever did. Not only did he ask great questions, but he framed them in a way that is exactly how people on the right would ask them giving Bernie a direct shot at convincing people other wise. I would not be surprised if there are not some people who will say &quot;I like Bernie after seeing him on Rogan.&quot;Joe Hogan talk wiff that guys Crazy Bernie. Cool manEverything needs to be FREE LOLIn Canada we don’t even have dental covered because its so expensive. Good luck with thatDude is still socialist scum.Not giving him props for shouting it out as a reality tv show because he plays into it so heavily. So hypocritical. Andrew Yang calls it out, yet he stands by it.People calling Bernie Stalin or Mao is the same as people calling Trump HitlerAbout fukin time joe.Fucking gay! Will not be watching this fucked up bullshit! This Bernie fuck is a communist! Joe is a fake ass bitch too. Both are communist fucks!Oh look, it’s that crazy old man that says he’s against “da wun pahsent!” but has 3 mansions.WWII was against Hitler and Japan, not China and Hitler. Bernie Sanders needs to get his facts straight, old socialist fart.Bernie 2020 match a voteBernie didn’t say a single radical, socialist, or communist thing. Just a lot of rational common sense arguments.I tried to hear Bernie out but he just doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about.said he wants to tax the rich 70% but he&#39;s also said he would tax the middle class in order for him to get Medicare for all is a middle-class going to get that 70% if any one making over 60,000 will to how that sound. The rice will still be rice mad that 70% of the millions are got but joe and rich ppl will still be millionaires. The middle class will be killed off and it will only be poor and rice is that the real planat this point the only ethical way forward is for Joe to have Trump on and give him as much time and be as polite as he was with Sanders, Gabbard, &amp; Yang<br />anything else would ne highly unethical considering the size and influence of Joe&#39;s audienceDisarm the American people so the government can take over.....that&#39;s a great strategy.!Not voting for socialism.Slow clap  Tu&#39;che thanks JoeBernie seeming real transparent, pointing out alot of the BS going onI wish he would have asked Bernie about when he sold out to Hillary Clinton and how he can afford a $120,000 sports car on his salary?I love my AR-15! It&#39;s become the most popular rifle in America. Many jobs are tied up in every part of its manufacturing chain all the way to retail. Leave ALL gun rights tf alone! Red flag laws violate our constitutional rights against illegal search and seizure! The media never talks about gun violence as it pertains to gangs, yet that is the single largest cause of gun deaths in this country and it&#39;s handguns, not assault rifles. Bernie&#39;s right about there being no cure for this. Obama said it well: &quot;Guns are in our DNA.&quot;Tulsi, Yang, n Bernie been on Rogan - Warren went on Power 105.1 :) Bernie has some good points and some pretty ugh ones, but he&#39;s about what he&#39;s about.As a guy who lives in germany, its really incredible to hear that u need to pay a doctor yourself. Literally every last dumbfuck hill billy alabama inbread gun owner should be able to realize how important health care is for their own well being. Your current system is not even bad .. its straight up evil. Like what psycho would wanna live in a country where you can get shot at any corner by anyone and afterwards go backrupt on the medical bills? fukin dystopian shit right thereCan we have 3 presidents in office at 1 time?This is the best episode Joe Rogan ever did.This guy talks about solutions with about as much detail as your average 5th grader. It&#39;s like a caricature of your prototypical politician answers. I&#39;m genuinely surprised, this is my first time hearing him speak for more than 30 seconds.Amazing! Thanks Joe.What causes someone to cause mass murder? Be suicidal? Lose their minds? How can you not when you put yourself in an inescapable hole of debt being persuaded by   for profit school and even things out of your control like medical bills. Or even buying a car. It&#39;s so expensive and paying it off slowly trying to beat the interest each and every month when you only take home 2000 dollars after taxes when the government takes 30% away.<br />Hardly even seeing any results. The roads in Phoenix are so stupid. There&#39;s literally a gap in every lane driving down the i-10 where it&#39;s almost impossible to drive on and not fuck your tire on. Not affording help could be what causes someone to mass shoot up a school.Awesome that Joe had Bernie on the show, it was cool to hear his thoughts.  I gotta say though, the defense budget is not something we use just to kill people.  It&#39;s pretty ignorant to say we can just slash it and keep the same lifestyle we all enjoy now.  Defense budget R&amp;D brings us the cutting edge of technology, and it&#39;s not an easy ask to just divert all that shit to &quot;education and healthcare&quot;.  Healthcare specifically is probably the most difficult issue we face in this country right now, and I don&#39;t yet know who has the answer.  Thanks for contributing to the discussion BernFuck this guy.I am a proud collapsitarian and I wholeheartedly support senator sanders for prez🙌🏼I like how the table has been cleared only at the Bernie&#39;s side. Welcome Bernie, welcome to your base.Bernie used to praise Venezuela as a success of socialism. <br />Until it wasn’t.I think Bernie means well but it’s just not enough. Maybe this is what we need... bad times to appreciate the better times and thus better politicians will rise up and set the country back on course.A couple times?  What kind? Where were you gettin it?   Hahahahahahahaha.  Crack me up joe rogan. Always the opritunist. Bravo.  And thanks for having all these candidates on to be able to connect with real americans more deeply so we can learn a bit more about them. Just that alone will jave a profound impact on how things change. Thank you sir for your contributions to information being availableafter all this and hes talking to the communist now. lost all respect for you joe.Vote for Bernie!Someone please give Bernie a gallon of lotion to gargleFuck to the yes Joe Rogan!!!Hey America ! if you don&#39;t want Bernie Sanders as President, we&#39;ll take him off your hands and send him north of the border and we&#39;ll give you Justin Trudeau in exchange cuz that tool is completely useless to us.Historic. This man understands America’s strengths and America’s weaknesses. This man has a genuine love for his country and for her people, all of them. He wants us to care about ourselves as much as he cares about us, and he is a leader. Thank you, Senator Sanders. And thank you, Joe.Piss poor interview Joe, your follow up questions are completely useless.Bernie says he will bring high tech jobs to distressed communities. A couple things;<br /><br />He will NOT bring high tech jobs to these communities because even as President and complete Dem control you cannot dictate where these companies will have their jobs at here in America.<br /><br />If he somehow turned into this achieving dictator (not a stretch to label him that is it?) then you would have what leftists call &quot;gentrification&quot; because these communities would not be qualified for these jobs.<br /><br />But why stop there if Dictator Sanders had his way forcing high tech companies to locate in the ghettos? You must now by law hire local residents that lived there 5 plus years. Now all these dictatorial laws must sprout up across America under a Sanders administration because he IS a sincere Democratic Socialist that will achieve what a true Democratic Socialist model looks like. And his objective doesn&#39;t care about what made America great. With these new laws he will effectively fuck up a lot of company&#39;s profits. That&#39;s a good things too... if you are fringe far leftist, right? Wrong. Once profits slide the workforce will be cut, but eventually even cease to exist because some socialist asshole forgot how free markets work and their policies won&#39;t work unless you completely uprooted the capitalist system... Just go out right authoritarian to make it work. And we must all pray this is a good authoritarian.Hmmm. Besides the &quot;think of the children&quot; and mistaking WW2 Japan with FUCKING China, not bad. Free college is great but getting people to graduate is another, but if you get rid of my 100k debt through the tax to wall street, fair enough. No touchy the guns bud, if crazy people can have them to kill me, I want them to kill the crazy people. Health care in America can be summed up with &quot;holy fuck that person weighs 400 pounds&quot; but LIFE saving drugs should be much less expensive if not free. Fixing &quot;shithole&quot; cities and drugs would be amazing and idgaf who does it, just wish someone would pitter patter and get at her. Overall not bad, but implementing it is another thing entirely. Possible runner up for my Cheeto in Chief, but only that. Thank you Joe for the insight into our next possible president, you do good work.TRUMP 2020How many times did he say McDonald&#39;s??Thank you Joe!!! Instead of a debate, all candidates should go on this podcast. So far I like Bernie the best.Hey YouTube is Free media.  why dont these candidates make channels and give us long video detailing their plans.  Here I am watching an hour long video of bernie and Joe rogan.  I&#39;d love to watch more of this but with fact checkers and other people interviewing these candidates.Joe&#39;s show proves that people want meaningful, polite and intelligent long form conversation. It also proves that the TV networks are totally out of touch. I&#39;ve listened to his shows of nearly four hours long and enjoyed every minute.The hypocrisy is REAL “We should pay $15 the hour” but can’t even pay his OWN campaign workers $15 p/hour okaaayy...... pay your workers “livable wages” <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23LeadByExample">#LeadByExample</a>!!! 🤧T R U M P    2 0 2 0Best hour and seven mins interview everTaxing transactions on the stock market will just stop high frequency trading.<br /><br />If you penalize it, people will stop doing it at that rateLot of ppl feeling the burn I just heard alot of ideas instead of answers. One thing for sure is more socialism isn&#39;t the answer.&quot;the power of money.&quot; Great start!I just wish the really IMPORTANT episodes (Musk, Sanders etc) were closer to the 3hr mark. They have so much to contribute, shame they seem to be limited to 1hr slots by their management.Joe I am a new podcaster and I&#39;d love to make it big time like you.  Do you have any advice to give to help me out?  It would be super appreciated!Bernie is a piece of shit communist! He was so fucking lazy , he was kicked out of a compound! So, if you don’t have time to tell your story in the stage you fucking communist, tell it now, you have had 4 years to site your bullshit story! Tic toc Bernie! When you die, it will be a good day!Thanks Joe: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/cmyy4g/its_been_a_long_road_but_bernie_youve_lost_me/ew5msrk/">https://www.reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/cmyy4g/its_been_a_long_road_but_bernie_youve_lost_me/ew5msrk/</a>The left and there dumb gun reform.  He admits it&#39;s pretty much impossible to make a difference with those ideas.  So let&#39;s do it our way on the right.  Un chain the 2nd amendment and let people carry guns everywhere.   Let some loser try to shoot up a school or anywhere with a dozen good guys with ARs n AKs.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m35s">1:04:35</a> war in the East with China?Trump is nx on the micThat was actually refreshing to hear.This is amazing.  We can only hope that some of the Trumpsters/GOP voting morons out there can listen to this with an open mind and look into Bernie.  He&#39;s the last real OG in politics and we need him more than ever.I love Joe and he is definitely trying but he doesn’t know enough about politics to be doing this interview quite franklyLOL,  free hours on television?  What century is this dude from?Bernie is a loon. Hates People with money but makes a million on a book how not to be rich. Moron.Bernie does seem like a good guy to talk to about things when he has a greater deal of time to talk about the issues. I may not agree with all of his policies but he&#39;s pretty genuine.Honestly Canadian healthcare isn&#39;t so great. It&#39;s not the free healthcare but the lack of option to pay for better care. Yes we spend a lot less on healthcare but it shows in areas like our equipment, wait times, and staffing. <br /><br />As for healthcare being a right, I get the sentiment but it&#39;s unrealistic. In order to have healthcare you need doctors and nurses. They are the healthcare. <br /><br />By saying you have the &quot;right&quot; to what they are, you&#39;d be saying you have the right to them and their time. I don&#39;t feel anyone should have the right to anyone else&#39;s time and labour. Sounds like the edge of a slippery slope into slavery. <br /><br />Keep in mind I don&#39;t disagree with everything Bernie says and believes, this is just a soft spot for me.Bernie used to call out millionaires,... until he become one. Now he calls out  multimillionaires. He just keeps moving the goalpost.Proud to hear these powerful ideas.I would have liked the interview a little better if it was twice as long so that he could have addressed other important questions. I wish he addressed the following question.  Why felons should be allowed to vote in federal elections while in prison?  I understand that if the individual is an American citizen and has payed and has served their time that they have a right to participate in public discourse but, as far voting during or after their sentence is considered, I am still on the fence.<br />For more information on his stance <br /><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/felons-should-be-able-to-vote-from-behind-bars-bernie-sanders-says">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/felons-should-be-able-to-vote-from-behind-bars-bernie-sanders-says</a>I would love to see trump on rogan.China already is moving heavily to green energyThose doctors are wrong, show me real stats. Diseases of despair my ass. So those jobs won’t be lost to China if we had better trade deals with the Chinese. Bernie wants to treat symptoms and not the causes. That’s the difference.MAGA 2020I&#39;d love to hear from Mayor Pete next.It&#39;s not me it&#39;s about us the people of the world just imagine being married having kids and you know that they won&#39;t live to become adults because we are killing ourselves get Bernie into office a green New Deal so I can see my grandkids and you can see your grandkids please vote for Bernie SandersGrenades are band in Switzerland but hundred are thrown and blown. Fix the mental health by banning fake news and bullyingI guarantee that the majority of thumbs down came from people that didn&#39;t even watch the podcast.Have Rand Paul on to debunk this clown - it&#39;s no wonder he&#39;s so concerned about healthcare he&#39;s already got a foot in the graveI’m pretty conservative but I truly appreciate long format discussions on any valid politicians and regular people alike. This is stimulating and interesting and what people need to hearThe discussion on guns was poorly pressed. I feel like Joe refused to behave normally out of respect for Bernie but he did a great disservice to his fans.Sorry but no thanks Bernie Sanders! Giving free shit to people is not the answer.Maybe pharmaceuticals are more expensive here because everyone else is getting it free....🤔As much as I hate Sanders being a hypocrite and having far fetched ideas, I&#39;m extremely intrigued by his idea of free health care. He kept me listening and got me agreeing with him, and surprised me with facts. He seems like quite a decent guy, when he is speaking about issues that is political.This guy is such a hypocrite. Loser.  All he cares about is where he will b buying his wife a new house.   Get out of here.what if joe got trump on here i wouldnt doubt it nowNow joe is beyond powerfulDope ass show!!!!When it comes to guns Bernie is clueless.  An &quot;assault weapon&quot; is exactly the same as a semi-automatic hunting rifle. The only difference is that one looks &quot;tactical&quot; like in the movies. If Bernie doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s talking about, he shouldn&#39;t be allowed to change the laws.Finally have a real liberal on, fuck that Adam guy.I dont know how we fix our health care system but we live in the greatest wealthest nation on this planet and every American citizen deserved affordable/free health care. Im sick of the ppl sayin we can&#39;t pay for it or afford it. Thats such bullshit man. If we cld just stop all the waste and fraud that goes on in the government we cld pay for it.JOR FOR PREZ.....Now get Tony Heller on the podcast to talk about climate scientists, Joe.Thanks for bringing Bernie on Joe Rogan.I like alot of what Sanders says except on guns. Guns are not for stopping a tyrannical pack of deer.Mumbles well, never really answers, crazy hair, free shit, rhetoric.... Bernie SandersUncle Bern has good intentions, but god damn this fucker is a clown on the debate stage. easy opponent for trump. we need an upgrade.I would love to be able to call that man The President of the United States.Thank you for giving us a chance to see Bernie Sanders on this type of platform. You do a good job Mr. Rogan.This gem was uploaded today but YouTube would rather fucking promote Jake Paul&#39;s fake ass marriage? Wtf YouTubeWho would love to see Trump on JRE??All I want is for no one to point a gun at me and take my money... Really, that’s it. Is that too much to ask?Bernie doesn&#39;t talk about the power lobbyists have is the power &quot;law maker&#39;s&quot; have given them. Bitching &amp; complaining but does nothing to STOP it under the law.. HYPOCRITEjoe rogan is a undercover cia agent. perfect candiadate because he is hands down the worlds greatest interviewer and probably podcaster as well he also by far the least suspicious most perfect person to have guests on that when it fits the agenda he agrees with them and if its a conspiracy theorist he challenges them hard. he USED to talk about ALL kinds of conspiracies and fake moon landing, lying NASA, governmental corruption etc.. Joe to this day will still bring in a WIDE VARIETY of guests as well as outspoken conspiracy theorist like Alex Jones, Bob Lazar, Eddie Bravo etc.. HOWEVER, somewhere along the line, Joe was approached and basically given 2 choices. shut down and shut up, or join the CIA undercover and pretend to still talk to EVERYONE, left wing or right wing, scientist or religious, desnt matter he will talk to you, but NOW, Joe Rogan will lean a totally different way than he used to. He agrees with everything the agenda is pushing for example democratic socialism, (which is basically socialism) AI and Elon Musk implanting people brain similar to the microchip in peoples hands, Joe used to believe in fake moon landing but Now he believes the moon landing is real and trusts NASA and the government. Although Joe sold out in my opinion, i understand, he has his name, his family, his legacy, his safety, UFC, JRE, everything he is involved in could have got ruined if he kept going the way he was going. Joe gained way too much popularity and thats why you will NEVER hear Joe rant about a conspiracy theory that we should look into . no he plays the devil advocate (which is apart of being a good interviewer)  but he clearly is protecting the Elite and secrets.Both Thumbs UpBernie, do as i say not as i do, Sanders. His school of thought will regulate and dwindle the economy until we&#39;re all looking up Venezuelan dog recipes. Come try and get our guns btw.Bernie has that Grandpa sweet swag that is very dangerous. He has made his career in a democratic republic and built his political career in a state that’s over 90% white. The day Bernie talks about the tens of millions of people dead under communism and its economic choke hold socialism, then I will take him serious. Until then he’s just another idealist trying to buy his way into office 👎🏻Eh.. I still think Andrew Yang is the better candidate . His podcast with joe made a lot more of connection with me and my beliefs.. but bernie is a good second choice! 🤙It&#39;s all good ideas but the main issue will always be far too many Americans have been brainwashed since the 1950&#39;s that left wing ideas are bad socialism is bad communism is bad they don&#39;t care to listen or learn many cant even be open minded enough to acknowledge better systems that pure capitalism existIn a nutshell: I want to bankrupt this country and leave it in an irreversible state.... You can use your imagination on what follows.Joe - &quot;how much is it now?&quot;<br />Bernie - &quot;idk, but its high&quot; ..... <br /><br />Wtf you cant argue a point if you haven&#39;t done research on it.THE common denominator for all anti-Bernie comments on this video:  <br /><br />&quot;This channel doesn&#39;t have any content&quot;Is it sustainable???  60% of total federal spending is on social safety nets (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security).  Roughly 1/3 of Americans are enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.  How will this be funded if we expand these programs to the Bernie plan?  It&#39;s not a matter of what we like to do, or what we should do.  It&#39;s about what we can afford to do.  Bankrupting the country IS A RADICAL IDEA, and irresponsible as hell.<br /><a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/">https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a> Kamala Harris didn&#39;t have a good response because she got fucking destroyed, not because she didn&#39;t have enough time to respond. Anderson Cooper gave her another chance to respond after the debate and the best she could come up with was &quot;I&#39;m a top tier candidate, Tulsi Gabbard is at 0-1 percent in the polls&quot;, and of course the tool agreed with her.Legendary 🤙This is wild. We are moving forward I hope my people. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Keep the fight going.WTF lol hell yeahBernie is an honest man. I have voted Republican my entire life but will vote for Bernie in 2020 and primaries.Judging by the interview being only one hour he doesn’t mind the time restraints,  doesn’t want to miss his nap time.Thank you thank you thank you thank you!Life is a meat grinder.  The population of the world keeps rising and everything is getting harder and harder and people are forced to live in much closer proximity and with fewer and fewer jobs.  You can&#39;t afford to pay rent or electricity or for food or car payments or insurance and you see actors and actresses getting millions of dollars to pretend to do what regular people do everyday for pennies.  And everything is designed to grind you down to nothing and people will snap.  It&#39;s terrible but that&#39;s the world we live in.Student Loan Debt is a mother fucker. Education shouldn’t cost this damn much but whatever...<a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/we-re-going-to-take-out-7-countries-in-5-years-iraq-syria-lebanon-libya-somalia-sudan-iran/5166">https://www.globalresearch.ca/we-re-going-to-take-out-7-countries-in-5-years-iraq-syria-lebanon-libya-somalia-sudan-iran/5166</a>Bernie is a modern day Franklin D. Roosevelt. He does not want full scale Socialism. Full scale Socialism, regardless if you agree with it or not, is the FULL democratization of the workplace. Bernie wants a Scandinavian style system where the U.S would still have a market-based economy, with sensible regulations and subsidized education with healthcare. In ANY Western European country, Bernie would be looked at as a Centrist. Only in a country like America would he be considered a &quot;Socialist&quot; which is quite frankly just laughable. Don&#39;t let the media fool you. He is the best candidate to alleviate the life of your friends, family and neighbours.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>I love how Bernie talks shit on rich people yet he owns 3 mansions and is a millionaireSo what exactly is an &quot;assault weapon&quot;?Joe Rogan saving America and shit.First off, thank you to both Joe Rogan and Bernie Sanders for doing this, long format interviews are phenomenal for getting to know people. Now second, Bernie is clueless, the majority of the problems he sights are caused by the government and yet he thinks government is the solution.... Doing the same thing again and again and expecting different results is a working definition of insanity....Uhhhg I love both of you!All puppets, dancing on a string. They are ALL crooks.You should of had Alex Jones on with Bernie.Joe rogan 2020I feel like I&#39;m watching Joe Rogan shape the future by asking the right questions here.In the last 3 years how many times has Joe gone home after an interview thinking to himself, “How the fuck did I get to interview this person? I was just doing Fear Factor and now this?”When the Democrats finally pick their primary, just throw them and Trump on this podcast. Screw Fox and CNN ratingsThanks Joe! You are the man!I like the amount of dislikes from people who probably haven’t even watched the entire podcast yet lolJoey Diaz for president!🔥🔥🔥<br /> FEEL MORE BERN ON <a href="http://tyt.com/">TYT.COM</a> THE LEADER OF PROGRESSIVE NEWS REPORTING!!<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/oJbPxfdiKus">https://youtu.be/oJbPxfdiKus</a>I respect Joe for really letting Bernie speak which is awesome. It is good to have Bernie in a format like this because he looks extremely rational here. The big news groups like to cut it up and make him look like crazy Bernie and not like someone that is really speaking to the next generation of leaders, which is an amazing thing.Bernie Sanders &quot;mairiuana&quot; lolTripped me out at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m20s">27:20</a> Dude sounded so confident like he was about to drop a fact but turned out to be a legitimate question because he knew none of the numbers.Joe thank you 🙏🏽Bernie is wrong about Canada. To get an appointment with specialist sometimes takes 3-4 months. You have to be absolutely disabled or bedridden to get your appointment moved up. Quality GP are very hard to find too. Family doctors are usually filled up so you have to stand in line to get a family doctor.Sorry to be that guy, but can we get Yang on again?100% better then any stupied debate you can watch on TV. I&#39;m not a huge support of Bernie but this was a good move by him.Joe why didn&#39;t you say you got my vote , u scary of big money too.Tulsi2020How can joe believe in ancient civilizations and huge cataclysms but still think there&#39;s something that can be &quot;done about climate change&quot; he contradicts his own beliefs by buying into the politicians version of climate change instead of listening to what the science says. ITS CYCLICAL ITS HAPPENED BEFOREGreat questions Joe!Joe Rogan, from JRE #1014: &quot;It&#39;s a hustle. Bernie&#39;s got a hustle going on. When you find out he&#39;s got all these houses, and his wife bought up all this land to expand the university she was running and she killed the whole fucking school. Like, you got greedy.&quot;Free schooling for arts major that don’t do shit to help man kind, finish school then scratch their assI really like this. I disagree with almost all of his political positions, especially about taxation and firearm rights, but it’s nice to hear Bernie talk and not scream at people. He sounds so much more reasonable in this formatHey commie bernie..peter schweizter says u were always a freeloader!..i see u r at it again..wasting mr rogans labor and time for your pathetic cause. DONT BE A SUCKER JOE! Im disappointed usually your guests are quite intelligent and self made men..this is a 180 degree for you Mr Roganwooooowwww props to bernie. Much more respect for him.Get ready for a Co2 Tax!Bernie just got my voteGreat was jus ready for bed now I hafto put it off for rogan and bernieCan&#39;t even pay his own staffers $15 an hour. He&#39;s a loonAndrew YangHe Softballed Sanders. He didn&#39;t challenge him on anything. Especially on weapons or &quot;assault weapons&quot;Bernie &quot;The freeloading, lying, never had a real job, Communist, take take take, free free free, covetous Jew, shit stirrer, Globalist NWO&quot; SandersPowerful move! Culture shiftingMy fuckin man🇺🇸Times Bernie raised his voice<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m20s">23:20</a>Yup keep calling him out on the dreams he&#39;s trying to sell to AmericansAs a Canadian let me tell you this, we are in a health care crisis! No fucking way you are spending a month in the hospital after heart surgery. my girlfriends mother went into have a breast removed due to breast cancer last week, she was discharge the next day. I&#39;ve been on a waiting list to see a specialist for two years! A women in my home town died a few months ago at our biggest and newest hospital after waiting eleven hours to see a doctor in screaming pain. She was rolling around on the floor before dying. NO DOCTORS. Bernie is lying by omission. Our system was working fine, until open immigration, under funding, brain drain, and bureaucracy crippled it. America has huge hurtles to overcome to make it work.Wonder if Joe will have Trump on his pod cast. He let this socialist nut bag on. IDC what anyone says, only lazy and ignorant ppl support Sanders. He&#39;s going to rape the tax payer, to support illegal aliens.Bernie Sanders for president, USA 2020!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸For a sec I almost got blue pilled. Then I realised some stuff. So first Trump is trying to stop try price inflation of big pharma and other companies. Trump is also trying to stop companies from moving to mexico. America is still polliuting less than it was in the last 20 years. Trump doesn&#39;t want the minimum wage boost because it will be to much and make companies automate to fast. Then free college is nice, but the real problem is the cost. College shouldn&#39;t be a big deal because it shouldn&#39;t cost so much. Its the same problem as big pharma. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t cost 20k for 15 hrs of lecture a week. Really Bernie and trump economically arnt so different. Also I&#39;m admit we will eventually become a socialist country due to automation in the next 20 years. Bernie&#39;s plan would work fine 20 years from now tbh economicslly. Trump is working in the now. Here is were trump gets me — social issues. We can&#39;t have unrestricted immigration to the country it&#39;s insane. Our country is our country because of our values. We can&#39;t have 1 million people coming every year. It&#39;s too much. Then we got the whole LGBTQAIPP+ stuff. Be gay. Be trans. Be a fooking unicorn. Just don&#39;t make my 5 year old have to learn about it, be exposed to it and gave to use the restroom with it. Then the anti gun stuff. Simple. I want the best tool to defend my five year old from a murderer. Sorry but I&#39;ll take 500 mass shooting deaths over millions living under fear and rape. This might sound radical, but we don&#39;t ban driving when we know if we did 30,000 people would be saved every year from crashes. Life if a hard choice sometimes. Just a thotBernie Sanders doesn&#39;t know who we fought in WWII.  He &quot;doesn&#39;t have the solution&quot; to every problem he brings up.  This dude is a fraud.  Plain and simple.Let’s be real! Social media has done great for politics than Television has ever done.Fuck this communist pig.Comment sections like these where people can blend into the pool of ideas and lose traction and notoriety. I agree with Bernie and his idea of psychical movements and actions being a greater method of change. We should organize online, and then take the one and only thing that belongs to us out there for everyone to see. Hell if it was organized to be the best it could, we could shut down focal points of our distaste for weeks, until legislation was passed. That&#39;s the type of change we need to be enacting.They keep changing the name when I was a kid they was telling us the world was going to freeze over then when I was in high school they was telling us it was going to flood time has past that point and now we have 12 years yeah ok how much have they made off of all of the go green bullshit they have been talking about. For anyone that says we have to be done with fossil fuels good luck every thing you touch or use was made from oil that comes from the ground. it’s all bullshit just a new scam they keep pushing to make more money.Lmao! Joe had to get his aliens question in there! 😂😂 That was a great question to end the podcast, though.He’s not yelling.Maybe if the majority of our men were actually men and we encouraged our men to be traditional men, they wouldn&#39;t be depressed, druggy, porn watching compulsive masturbating losers that play video games all day and browse 8chan or 4chan or whatever.  Our constitution didn&#39;t take into account that all of these degenerate activities that most (mainly) atheist males partake in would be EVER accepted.   Obviously our males are fucked in the head nowadays.  We vilify them for being male. We vilify them for being white. We ignore their problems.    Do you realize that the vast majority of mentally ill people in the United States are white males?  The vast majority of drug over doses are white males?  The vast majority of suicides in this country are white males?  Obviously, now that our culture has gone far, far left, we can&#39;t let people have guns anymore.  They&#39;re too fucking stupid and morally vacuous.He&#39;s still missing the point on the gun issue, either intentionally or unintentionally. It&#39;s not the tool, it&#39;s the intent to do harm. Ban certain guns, home made explosives, vehicles, edged and impact weapons would be used. Laws effect the law abiding.  Not trying to be needlessly disagreeable, I&#39;m not a member of either party and I haven&#39;t voted in a presidential election in a very long time.Don’t sell yourself short Joe. You should’ve had Tulsie on 😉I thought Bernie was honestly a bad guy and and a socialist asshole but now seeing him speak in a calm form, I see a good guy with good ideas maybe not so much the 15 bucks an hour because that makes no sense but I see lots of good👍🏻Bernie &quot;I just spoke to this woman, I couldn&#39;t believe it Joe&quot; Sanders<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m51s">2:51</a> It&#39;s done through public owned or partially owned by the government, the only equivalent is PBS I believe which has a low viewership and thus to make sure people see it they go to the private networksDidn&#39;t have any of the problems we have today in america before 1965...<br />When jews like bernie opened the borders by changing the immigration laws.....<br /><br />No borders no walls....no USA at all<br /><br />Vote bernieStill not a fan of his pitch!!!! Nice guy though.He asked about aliens 😂Joe in regards to the shooter in el Paso.. Adderall DOESN&#39;T cause white supremacist ideology you ignorant cuck!Lol rogan couldnt help but ask about the aliens XDBernie “I talked to this man/woman...” SandersMAGA 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸I really like this, but I wish people would offer facts when they make bold claims like &quot;We only have 12 years left.&quot; I&#39;m all about science, but I get offended when people just tell me &quot;The scientists say it,&quot; instead of offering facts. And then they ridicule you for questioning something so obvious. I&#39;m all open, but when someone tells me to accept something on face value, just because the scientists say so, that carries little more authority than telling me something like &quot;Jesus says so.&quot;<br /><br /><br />On another note, anyone here see Ryan Dawson&#39;s woodshed video on Sanders? He really destroyed him based on his record of supporting nearly every war. But Sanders seems like such a good guy from this interview here. I&#39;m so conflicted!Yang2020Say what you will about Bernie&#39;s policies, but he is one of the few candidates who actually gives a damn about tackling political corruption and election reform. America is fucked if it can&#39;t get corporate influence out of government.Dear God. Cue the special people and all the colorful comments, gonna need a nice mug of coffee to sit and read all of this entertainmentScience also said that the polar bears would be Extinct and all of the glaciers would be gone by 2020 and now science is saying that the glaciers are growing even nasa said the Antarctica ice cap is growingActually don’t like Bernie or any politician for that matter on JRE. Don’t mind political talks with interesting people who could have a more credible answer depending on their job and context of the conversation. But politicians on JRE almost gives them some sort of undeserved credibility that what they’re saying is interesting when in reality it’s just a different way for them to get talking points out. I could care less right or left they both do it and Bernie did it here just in a different context that JRE gave himFREE PALESTINE!!!!!!Bernie is so right on all the issues. If you really listen and get the MSM out of your head.War with China in the east and war with Hitler in the west lol. I think he meant to say war with Japan in the east.Walmart would love higher minimum wage, then they could finally kill off all the small business.<b>F**ck *Bernie &#39;Sellout&#39; Sanders..

Ask Venezuela.But Bernie, the 80/20 rule is, has always been, and will always be . . .I would like to see all candidates come on Mr Rogans show and present their case. I like the idea of actually listening to a candidate just talk.This was a great conversation.Why does he keep saying &quot;assault weapons&quot;... you can&#39;t buy assault rifles dipshitI don&#39;t agree with Bernie, but I appreciate Joe hosting him on this podcast. I wish more candidates went on shows like this for hours of unfiltered discussion. We definitely need actual debates in this country and not mainstream media reality shows.Joe at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=45m45s">45:45</a> just trying to see if weed is gonna be legal😂😂😂Bernie couldn&#39;t be more incorrect about the quality or availability of health care in Canada.  Just ask a fucking Canadian and stop listening to these talking heads.  Utter nonsense.I can&#39;t listen to &quot;assault weapon&quot; arguments.  Every weapon is an assault weapon, yep, all of them.  That&#39;s why they&#39;re called weapons, they are meant to assault.  Fk it, I&#39;m gonna start calling my AR my shield gun.JOE! you need to hold a debate live in your studio with berny, tulsi, yang, and whomever else that has something to say.In the episode with Yang, Joe said he didn&#39;t like Bernie and basically called him disingenuousBERNIE 2020I am just telling women that I support Bernie Sanders just to get laid.Heart surgery in America could cost a lot of money. Waiting for heart surgery as well as waiting for consultations before and after said surgery could cost you your life in canada. Canada also offers private insurance because of the extensive wait times, if you want real comprehensive healthcare in canada, you pay for it. If you want real comprehensive health care in america, you pay for it. But unlike america, you are also paying for your health care through taxes in canada, so you pay for heath care twice. Certain things sound great on paper but when you look past what sounds good or feels good you can see the truth behind anything. If you have a belief and you havent challenged it yourself to make sure it holds up, you are doing yourself a big disservice.Bring Trump’s ass on... would love to hear him drivel for an  hourI don&#39;t know much but I have learned about the CAFRs, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports that all governments, towns, counties, states, school districts and Federal release every year.  There can be found the full accounting.  The assets, investment income, enterprise income, tax revenue income, autonomous agency income and they all show that none of these entities are bankrupt or even close to it.  They talk about the budgets but never mention the CAFRs.  Taxes are only one third of their revenue after investments and enterprise.  They could do away with all taxation and still cover the costs of running the respective gov&#39;t.  Which there are some 180,000 plus entities that all have CAFRs show they all have these same accounting structures, funds and investments.  YouTube or Google CAFR, Walter Burien or Corporation Nation, Clint Richardson.  <br /><br />My question is why can&#39;t these multi billions of funds, even trillions in some cases, be used to address some of these issues.  Keeping in mind the government prints money/debt into existence and then charges interest on it.  <br /><br />Additionally many of the money problems Bernie and others mention, I believe are caused by the debt based currency/monetary system in place.  Money is debt.  It&#39;s an IOU.  Money is created when debt is created.  So the cost of college, housing, health care etc would go back to a seemingly affordable range if the money we use was not debt based.  Prices don&#39;t go up or down, the value of the currency goes up or down as a measurement, like a thermometer measuring temps.  <br /><br />Lastly in Robert T. Kiyosaki&#39;s latest book he says in 2018 the number one asset of the U.S. Government is student debt.  Which would explain why it&#39;s not applicable under a bankruptcy.  Most if not all millionaires and billionaires understand how to use debt as an asset not a liability. <br /><br />Joe if you see this, or anyone else, please look up the CAFRs and learn about the debt based monetary system in place and do a show on that.  <br /><br />And get Robert Kiyosaki on.<br /><br />Good Day.I lean right and I thought this was a great interview. Joe did a great job. Bernie seems cool, (although I think his head is a little in the clouds) But I totally agree with  Bernue when it comes to the drug companies. He&#39;s 100 % right.<br /><br />Still, Of the Democrats Joe&#39;s interviewed, Gabbard (Hawian Soldier) has been my favorite.<br /><br />It&#39;s Ashame a large amount of the Left are so Trump-Struck they let their insanity hurt Bernie, Yang and Tulsia... They have some great candidates... But with the help of Fake News, the best if the Left won&#39;t have a chance.<br /><br />Shame. As a moderate conservative, I support more left candidates than the left media does.YOU NEED TO GET TRUMP ON HEREThe government definitely has active price ceilings on medical products that company’s aren’t allowed to surpass, they can’t just “Price it whatever they want whenever they want”YANG GANG BIHThanks Joe. Great interview.well he didnt say he wouldnt let us know lolI’m waiting until they make free school to gohave fun believing his bullshit. he can&#39;t even make eye contact while talking to joe. ssshhhheeeeeppppppis Ronnie  the clown Macdonald Donnie Trump next then?Thank you both.  100%Joe &quot;one last question about aliens&quot; RoganNot one peep from young JamieNow I know who I need to vote for to know about aliensAh Bernie Sanders, the rich old white man that everyone who hates rich old white men loves.I&#39;m hoping I get my Unicorn in teal as he shoots Roman candles out his ass. When I wipe my ass with hundred dollar bills that weekend at bernies will  find in the air and make a magic society we all skip around in... yay...<a href="https://youtu.be/q2jijuj1ysw">https://youtu.be/q2jijuj1ysw</a>I love the idea of candidates speaking for 30 minutes without commercial interruptions per issue. It should be that way here.Great podcast........but; the difference in the line of questioning between leftists and conservatives on this show is blatant. Joe started unraveling on Crowder for saying he didn’t want to talk about weed; and Bernie comes on and advocates for free: college, healthcare, child care, fossil fuel ban, open boarders, and a incredibly vague description of an assault weapons ban, and Joe asks at the most 2 soft ball follow up questions.Prove all the brainwashed Americans wrong Bernie!Bernie introduced 357 bills since 1991... 3 passed and became law, 2 of those were the re-naming of posts offices.<br />🤔Bernie seems reasonable but assault weapons ARE illegal. On this subject he&#39;s talking out of his ass. Fully automatic weapons are illegal. I wish he&#39;d say which weapons are &quot;assault&quot; weapons. If he means AR15&#39;s only a tiny percentage of mass shootings are committed with them and they aren&#39;t fully automatic weapons.I think Bernie means well I really do, but I still have a hard time understanding his plan. I would like to hear more of the numbers behind these taxes on Wall Street speculation. All of his ideas seem great I really just believe Yangs ideas are more thought outWait so the first thing he said was Andrew Yang’s line about the debates being a reality tv show? Bahaha. Yang was right. They are all going to start sounding just like him.That was a great interview. Touched on a lot of the biggest issues. Thoroughly enjoyed hearing Bernie&#39;s view without interruption.For obvious reasons, all i hear is bullshit from politicians. They are extremely self motivated for their own personal gains. Its all a ridiculous game of power and money. They&#39;re all the same, and they never make a difference in this world. People who help humanity advance make a  difference. People who create things. Politician is just a job. They don&#39;t really care about humanity, its a job for sociopaths and psychopaths. You have to be a certain type of person to be a politician. Best believe, its not what you would consider &quot;Normal&quot;.Maybe the mass shootings are just karma coming back to haunt America for all the deaths it is responsible for with unneeded wars, and then don&#39;t forget the negative effects of American overseas manufacturing where workers have no rights, and there are no real environment laws so the pollution leads to a huge amounts of health problems leading to deaths... That&#39;s real stuff, and you can&#39;t just ignore it because it doesn&#39;t directly effect Americans. It makes us a parasite of sorts. then we suffer from hyper consumerism which does drive the economy, but it puts most americans it debt because they live beyond their means, and the only true value we have anymore is hedonism. then there&#39;s the whole bullshit that is the political dichotomy which really only serves to divide us. it&#39;s certainly not helpful for interpreting something as complicated as human society, and it&#39;s archaic af.FUCK BERNIE SANDERS. SOCIALIST BIG GOVERNMENT.After this podcast, I&#39;m convinced Bernie will be president.....That&#39;s not a good thing.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JoeJustChangedTheGame">#JoeJustChangedTheGame</a>You should have Bill Gaede the physicist on.After watching this, I dislike Bernie Sanders. He has terrible political ideas, but I’m grateful he came on to have a conversation with Joe.Bernie is nothing but an old snake oil salesman, making his pitch to the young and dumb crowd. That gig made Bernie a multi millionaire, while really never having a real job his whole life. Meanwhile none of his policies are economically feasible. Unless you want everyone but the 1%, like Rogan, to be latched onto the government teet from cradle to grave. That&#39;s socialism!Just started my monthly donation!It would be awesome if Joe could get every candidate on the podcastHe&#39;s the jew world order, don&#39;t let them take yours means to defend yurselvesPut aside the fact that Bernie is a multimillionaire who has only ever worked for the government.  Remember when Hillary and the DNC got caught rigging the primary and Bernie stood silent?  Then Bernie gave his support for Hillary and campaigned for her instead. Bernie stood silent again when his supporters wanted their campaign donations refunded. What did Bernie do instead?  Good old Bernie went out and stumped for the corporate owned DNC with his partner being Tom Perez.<br /><br />Bernie is a coward and sellout.<br /><br />Atleast he got a 3rd vacation home out of the deal.Yes Bernie government is corrupt, the more government the more corruption that&#39;s not gonna change . It is human nature, that&#39;s why we need Ron Paul and not you!Yeap. As senile and misinformed as I thought he&#39;d be. Can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t enjoy it!MAGA 2020Maybe try an get rand Paul on next?This is so refreshing. no annoying audience cheering after every sentence. no soundbites. just raw facts and personality. Joe should do this for all the candidates.Who is this guy?Just to show how much ideas or no-ideas can be revealed by a &quot;more than 12 sec&quot; interview. Good on Sanders to pop in to the social media platform from his busy schedule in rich-and-powerful controlled main stream media arena for an hour. Others only have this one platform. Well done JRE!Please learn about guns before interviewing these people. I was in the military. You can&#39;t buy military assault weapons without paying 200 dollars and going through the background check which can take over a year to get done. There is not many people willing to do that. So the guns just look the same. Any magazine feed deer rifle could fo the same as most of these mass shootings. Semiautomatic rifles are just most rifles so they dont understand the difference. Pistols could do the same, and have done the same, like the college that had pistols and killed over 30. Does anyone think white supremacists or gangsters would turn in their guns? Please think about it before you vote for someone that will leave us defenseless. Even if all assault rifles were turned in, and magically  even criminals and extremists did. The next shooting will be pistols. London had more knife deaths after gun control. And if trump gets us in a big war, wouldn&#39;t it be nice to know that some good people have guns? More concealed carry and less media for these psychopaths. Take away guns and make it harder for concealed carry and more people will die<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxnews.com/opinion/a-good-guy-with-a-gun-has-saved-many-lives-in-florida-something-the-media-rarely-report.amp">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxnews.com/opinion/a-good-guy-with-a-gun-has-saved-many-lives-in-florida-something-the-media-rarely-report.amp</a>Joe, I love your style of interviewing. Even though I can tell you agreed with Bernie, you played devil’s advocate and gave him tough questions. You weren’t a sycophant. Probably most importantly, you took un-distorted arguments and objections that came from outside the echo chamber so to speak.<br /><br />This should be the standard. If a candidate can’t answer tough questions on the fly, drop them like a bad habit. If they can, then they genuinely believe what they say and are knowledgeable about it.Joe Rogan sucked an old man&#39;s dick the whole interview.  JOE CAME OFF AS REALLY STUPID. ZERO KNOWLEDGE. SUBMITTED TO A SOCIALISTHe probably believes in what he&#39;s saying, but it looks pretty bad for someone who openly calls himself a socialist to talk about stopping law abiding citizens from buying any type of gun that is our right as United States citizens to buy. But I&#39;m glad he was on the podcast so we could hear his perspectives.Why didn&#39;t you ask him about getting fucked over by the DNC and bending the knee to Hillary ?This conversation will live on long after you leave this place, Joe ✊Nobody’s ganna find much real info here. Socialist BernieTrump needs to come to the podcastI’d vote for him if I see a medical report from his doctor indicating that he won’t have a heart attack and die of shock if he gets elected.Bernie gonna get himself suicidedUltimately pointless conversation but good idea though.If they forgive student loan debt I should get something for attending a reasonable in-state college and paying for it myself. Responsible people are punished.Donald Trump calls reasonably people like this crazy.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>I like Joe Biden and Tulsi Gabbard but I cld deal with Bernie Sanders man. He&#39;s not not way left like the rest of the dems. They have no chance of beating President Trump. Its gotta be Biden or Bernie. If they screw them over like in 2016 for 1 of those far left loonies im gonna vote for TrumpMake For-Profit news organizations illegal.I mean, I appreciate his perspective, but he just doubles the deficit with each new point thinking that the rich are just hiding trillions in taxes.  It’s not really workable.I rarely hit the like button on any of JR&#39;S stuff.. ima big fan but it&#39;s just somethin I don&#39;t really do. He gets plenty of likes... but this time I did... fuck the hatersBernie, for the last GOD DAMN TIME THERE IS &quot;NO GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE&quot; AT ALL.A broken record. Bernie is in charge of outreach and signed a pledge with the DNC that he will never run against the grain. He’s collecting voters for Kamala and Biden, and money for down ballot candidates, he knows he will never win, he doesn’t want to. His job is to excite voters to vote down ballot. His Bros truly deserve to be fooled twice!Rogan got the herpe on his lip like Valtrex hasn&#39;t been invented yet...In Canada, there&#39;s not enough nurses and doctors and we wait over 24-48 hours sometimes (almost always during winter) im the ER. Not only due to shortage of specialists, but also because people abuse it. Have a cold? Sure go to the ER. Scratched yourself a little? Better have the Dr check. Also it&#39;s not free, you pay a shit ton of taxes but Bernie won&#39;t tell you because people don&#39;t bother researching what politicians say and just swallow it.<br /><br />Btw, I&#39;m not saying the US system is better, I&#39;m just saying the Canadian one is shit.What do Bernie supporters think of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>This is an extremist trying to sound be reasonable. Oh, and that heart surgery in Canada that Bernie is talking about is after being on a wait list for six months. go listen to timcast on youtube.No wayHaven&#39;t watched yet... Hoping to god Joe gets Bernie to take a puff of his spliff!!!&quot;BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS JOE!&quot;<br />He got heated.we need this man more than <a href="http://ever.as/">ever.as</a> long as the mindset of America is &quot;how can we make as much as possible&quot; we are fucked.we need Bernie!God damn Joe Rogan,  God damnedNot necessarily a Bernie Sander<br />s fan but i enjoyed the podcast. Thank you Joe Rogan for being non biased✌JOE AND TRUMP!!!! now that would get views!  I would watch at least three timesHoly fuck joeOh GOD, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m00s">5:00</a> minutes of this lunatic is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m59s">4:59</a> minutes more of him than I can takeSocialism sounds pretty cool until you&#39;re eating the family dog for dinner.Bernie “you wanna talk about health care?” Sanders<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: damn I really got 150 likes this has never happened before lmao. Follow @bruh.mement on Instagram tho 😎I&#39;ve never heard conservatives call health care a &quot;privilege&quot; but Bernie always starts off talking about health care by saying it&#39;s a human right not a privilege. It&#39;s neither, it&#39;s a service provided to you by other humans.270 mass shooting in a year? what are you talking about? The entire number of shootings from 1982 to now is only 114. (<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/)">https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/)</a> it&#39;s not hundreds per year. still too many but not 270. Not even close.100% agree with the corporation related things he talked about...just not the social justice liberal ideology.I wonder who’s fault it will be, when they eventually legalise H or coke and armed with these freedoms, citizens make increasingly shitty choices, because we always do!! Therefore requiring more govt social engineering to mitigate the shitty choices apparently independent citizens make. People will moan that those with more executive function are exploiting others as they have drug privileges, basically the ability to say no, but sell it to people who say yes 🤦🏾‍♂️. Can’t wait next shift in civilisation in 150/200 years? I’ll be long dead, but I’m for a mixture of China, India and Russia 🤞🏾. I wonder what everyone will be complaining about then👨🏾‍💻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Canada has long waits for their medical care. It is not happy go lucky same say free doctor visits and free medicine.If he didn’t bow down to the DNC when he was screwed in 2016, I’d be all for him and supporting everything he says.. But he’s bought.. Just like all the other cronies. Sorry..Thank you Joe Rogan for your platform. We need all candidates to spend at least an hour on this podcast. I have gotten to know Bernie Sanders way more in this hour and seven minutes than I ever would have watching TV.I&#39;m young and pretty much broke. I dont think healthcare is a human right though.I agree very little with Bernie, but I admire a good conversation and admire Joe for giving a platform to all sides.Why not set a lower minimum wage for those under 18?<br /><br />Don’t wanna 🤪All this sounds like bernie wants from presidency is to experiment on usThis was a little wonky.The Toe licks again.Wouldn’t vote for that guy. Ever.I am so conflicted inside right now. He makes so much sense about lobbying and what not. But, then he says shit like medicare for all should be a right. No one has the right to others time and labor. Rights are rights by nature not by choice.Bernie is a sell out to Hilary absolutely amazing and people still love him but fuck trump pleaseIdk man. Saying guns kill people is like saying drugs do people.I was waiting to hear the Colby covington talk!

It was great.Hello dumpster fire.What would politics be if there was no influence from big corporations? Answer &quot;a true democracy &quot;Why didn’t/don’t  you have President Trump on?

This will replace the silly debates.Pull that up Jamie....Don&#39;t agree with the man but I respect the willingness to have a conversation and I will listen to it regardlessHealthcare is not a human right. <br /><br />You cannot have a human right that is dependent upon the services of other people. That would require you to press other people by force into providing those services even if they are unwilling.Socialism sounds pretty cool until you&#39;re waiting in a bread line to feed your family.I really hope this is a trend. It&#39;s so important to actually hear these candidates be able to explain things in a long form conversation. Good on all of the politicians who&#39;ve made an effort to do this.Lmao I thought Joe was gonna bring up DMT after the marijuana talkFuck yesBernie has full blown dementiaI could give two fucks less about his socialist policies, I just have one question for this man. Who taught you how to say human?When he started talking about tv, I realized he&#39;s a socialist nutjobOkay, now have Bernie, Tulsi and Yang all on together.Bernie &quot;I never held a job&quot; Sanders.if listening to this guy say he wont allow &quot;assault weapons &quot; to be sold in this country if he becomes president doesnt solidify  that this schill isnt FIT TO BE PRESIDENT  then fuckkkkk you tooI can&#39;t wait to vote for this man.  What a great interview. Thank you, Joe, for having him on.Gun violence is also part of the &quot;diseases of despair &quot;.Holy shit..madlad actually did it..also Bernie went full chewie on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m21s">0:21</a>.When you think Bernie is a pretty good dude but his fanboys still make your skin crawlCanada is rife with collusion just like the US. But to bring up big pharma and not bring up Israel when it comes to lobbiesWhat about all the people who work in the aviation industry, when you eliminate fossil fuels? So what, I&#39;m going to go from fixing aircraft to being a window installer?Check out my podcast! A little different then Joes!Joe is teaching the world so much one podcast at a time.this man has moulded the man i am today started at 19 im 27 now ♥️I still dont like him. Less government please.Trump 2020Putin would clown the shit out of this skeletonThank you for being adults!What part of Shall not be infringed is so difficult to understand?The jew and his liesI&#39;d take him seriously if he was running 3rd party as he should.  You think the Dem &quot;super-delegates&quot; will let him in?  How did that work in 2016?I would just like to add another positive comment about this podcast. This is real discussion. This is what we need to see from every presidential candidate. Not the network TV debates.First Dr. West, now Comandante Sanders.<br />Joe, you are finally giving the left its day. <br />I have to ask, are we as you believed us to be?But is he giving your money to the blacks<b>**you should had ask him when is he going to get a real fucking job, it’s easy to speak about socialism, increasing min wage and all the shit he wants when for like 50 years he is been part of the problem, and never had a real 8-5job, fuck this old head he is done.**</b>Bernie / Tulsi 2020!The undergraduate 2019-2020 estimated tuition &amp; fees at University of California-Berkeley is $14,198 for California residents and $44,191 for out-of-state students.<b>sparks blunt</b>I don’t agree with a lot of his policies, but damn I respect the fuck out of him. He’s honest, unselfish, and very competent in general. Even though I don’t agree with him on healthcare and these universal free shit for everyone type issues, I still might vote for him.Bernie&#39;s administration is Beto, AOC, Booker, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. Bring back Hillary as Secretary of state. Lmao. God help us all.&quot;Too stupid or you&#39;re in on it. Either way I can&#39;t trust you. You&#39;re out.&quot;Why is nuclear never mentioned when talking about reducing emissions, it beats solar and wind by milesWell that didn&#39;t answer a damn thing for me.. All I could think about was Joe asking a question, then bernie running around the mountain not to answer with any detail at all. That was a train wreck for him.Vote for Bernie if you want Middle class taxes to be dramatically increased and to receive the same type of service of a DMV. His ideas sound good on paper, but wouldn&#39;t work as well in reality. Look at the ACAAnd despite the attention this video will get, we won’t see Bernie get a bump in the polls since we all know the pro Joe Biden coalition of the DNC just got funneled another billion dollars from Jeff Bezoshe copied yangCompare this guy to Trump.  Let’s be real for a second - ideologies and policies aside, the discrepancy in maturity and intellect between him and this guy is astounding.  Even if you align more with conservatism, you’re an outright liar if you try to say that Trump is a man that is more fit to be POTUS than Sanders.Where&#39;d  Bernie&#39;s Radical neck go?Was really hoping Bernie would smoke a joint with Joe, but whatever.Like Bernie said, get Mitch on the show have him explain his dumb ass self.I don&#39;t want an 80 yo president no matter what. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23imfortulsi">#imfortulsi</a>Only problem with Canada&#39;s health care is that you have to wait very long and the doctors aren&#39;t the best. Yes the system isn&#39;t good but it&#39;s free ;) you get what you pay for not much. Also don&#39;t mind 50% taxe btwSanders as president and Warren as the vice. That is the winning ticket for the Dems. We’ll see if they choose the candidates for the people or want to go with another neo liberal / establishment dems that won’t implement real change.Trump 2020I want these candidates to go head to head with Tim Pool.<br />He throws hard hitting questions and isn&#39;t left or right.I LOVE JOE ROGAN, <b>Bernie evaded answering the obvious about psychiatric drugs  BECAUSE HE IS A SHILL AND HE THINKS AMERICANS ARE STUPID!  And everyone can read him</b> good job JoeI want to share what the media will not. To be clear, I&#39;m not a Democrat, I realize that BOTH parties are corrupt. Bernie is not really a Democrat either he only runs as one because he thinks it&#39;s his only chance to win. He knows both parties are corrupt as well. <br /><br /><br />On to my point: here is what corporate media run by the wealthy won&#39;t reveal: Bernie is NOT fighting for &quot;free stuff&quot; or to end private industry. That&#39;s bs from the media and the oligarchs. What he is fighting for, is basic human needs and to end the corruption within our government. He wants to allocate government funds to benefit all of us. He is what we&#39;ve always wanted, but those benefiting from this rigged system fear him ending it. Currently corporations can LEGALLY bribe candidates with millions of dollars in return for tax breaks, subsidies and much more. It&#39;s absolutely disgusting that we allow this. Most politicians take the money, they can&#39;t resist. In return they implement and perpetuate programs that benefit these rich folks doing the bribing, and we are all left with the bill. Anyone that&#39;s not rich should be uniting against this sick corruption, and that is Bernie&#39;s goal.<br /><br /><br />The media, the wealthy politicians and billion dollar corporations see Bernie fighting to end the rigged system that makes them all rich and powerful. So they lie, smear Bernie and do whatever they can to stop him. We must stop thinking in terms of conservative vs progressive, we must think in terms of honest vs corrupt. All of you that are  honest and want to end this corrupt system, let&#39;s unite. Let&#39;s stop letting them pit Dem vs Republican so we dilute our power. Let&#39;s support politicians that do not take bribe money from the wealthy, like Bernie. Would you rather or government use funding for programs that help people and businesses that are already rich, or for programs that benefit the many, including people and small businesses that actually can use the help? Let&#39;s stop being conned, let&#39;s end the handouts to the wealthy and have a government that gives everyone not handouts but an equal opportunity. We can take the corrupt system down IF we stop bickering and all come together.I already loved joe. But man you are doing the world a service brother that no main stream media outlet could do any better. Thank you sir. &amp; Thank you Bernie Sanders, been donating since last year! You chose the right outlet.You got videos with 400K views in 8 hours that are trending. How is this video not trending?Hey Bernie!!! Do you know what i want? I want to keep the majority of my paychecks. Why the hell is it up to the responsible working citizens to pay for healthcare for everyone unwilling to work. Healthcare is not a god given right.  Its people like you that make me want to give up on life cause there is so much evil in you and all your dipshit followers will destroy the greatest country on the planetLove Bernie. ...we need his policy ideas more than ever in the country.Pretty sure you have to pay capital gain taxes when it comes to trading...20 mins in, Joe: what you do as President?<br />Bernie: says a bunch of nonsense. Obama &amp; Trump both had control of Congress at some point and got nothing done.<br />Joe: why do we allow off shore account?<br />Bernie: blah blah, if I&#39;m President I will...<br />No you won&#39;t. The US President doesn&#39;t control world markets or international banking, so you can&#39;t do Jack shit.<br /><br />This is the poster child of your bullshit resistance of hashtag catchphrases and recreational outrage. Bernie may be the only man more full of shit than Trump.Sanders is clearly the only sane choice.No ones buying firearms legally then selling them to criminalsOh great. You heard the socialist say it. <br />Don’t be fooled. <br />When socialist say “revolution” that means   Communism then GULAGS then GENOCIDE!!!!!!!!. <br /><br />Please learn history fuckers. <br /><br />This is how we are enslaved!<br /><br />200 million deaths from this ideology!!!!!<br /><br />How many fucking people have to die before you stupid fucks stop being tricked by Marxist con artists. <br /><br />BERNIE DOSENT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU!!!<br /><br />Bernie is just as greedy if not more than the people he demonizes!!!<br /><br />He won’t settle until he has control of all of the wealth! Not just what a billionaire EARNED!!!!<br /><br />No one escapes from COMUNISTS PRISIONS. ASK A NORTH KOREAN. <br /><br />God save us from easily manipulated morons. SMH!!!Satanic pedovore illuminati puppet!Watching to see if Joe goes stupid easy on this dumbass. <br /><br />2 minutes in: Yep.Why so many dislikes? 🤷🏾‍♂️Joe wasn’t asking follow up questionsDid Joe ask Bernie about his &quot;Baltimore looks like a 3rd world Country&quot; comment?  Did I miss it...hmm?Shouts to big bernBernie has my vote.Gun control legislation didn’t do shit for Chicago, where everyday more people are shot than in all of these mass shootings. Gun control legislation lead to every single genocide in history. If you try to come for them, you better come armed and you should probably send bachelors.Trump gonna get on here now. “☝🏻believe me Joe Rogan, I’ve eaten the biggest, juiciest elk. I only get the best Elk👌🏻”Thank you Joe, I officially subscribed  ur channel because of  Bernie&#39;s  interview.Nothing is worse than listening to a politician tell an anecdote.Forget the dems, get trump on! That would be Alex Jones levels of insanity!!!Every candidate should do this!Sanders campaign spamming the commentsWho tf thumbs down this video and why🤔Why can’t this kook speaking without clicking his lips .. please god don’t let this man winBernie/Tulsi 2020 or Tulsi/Bernie 2020(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)Let&#39;s stop being divided and come together against the corrupt folks and lobbyists. I can acknowledge that BOTH parties are corrupt can you? Both accept bribes from billion dollar corporations. The wealthy folks running the media manipulate the truth about Bernie because they know Bernie is the one that will not take bribes and will end their subsidies, tax break and other socialism for the rich. More money goes to corporate welfare than to social welfare believe it or not. Yet somehow middle class folks are against Bernie for supporting healthcare and basic human needs. It&#39;s crazy. It&#39;s up to us to help get the word out that&#39;s the only way we take down the corrupt Dems and Republicans.WHY DIDN&quot;T YOUTUBE RECOMMENDED ME THIS?!?!?! I got here thanks to a commentator on a Kyle Kulinski video.Very refreshing to see Joe bring on Comrade Panders.MSM is dead. There is absolutely NOTHING informative on TV. It’s entrainment ONLY.... Long form interviews only for me.This guys an imbasilGod id love to see Trump come on this show and talk to Joe. He would absolutely fall apart in this situation with someone like Joe asking good questions and holding him to his statements.Notice how when EVERYTHING that comes out of his mouth he can&#39;t look Joe in the eye!  He&#39;s ALWAYS looking down.  He can&#39;t look someone in the eye when he&#39;s spreading his socialist BS because it&#39;s ALL A FUCKING LIE!Can we just roll all presidential candidate through Joe Rogan so we can get a decent look at em all?Bernie &quot;Radical&quot; SandersI have a question. Who is Big Pharm and  who owns its? Is it just a bunch of investors?I guess Bernie is alt-right adjacent nowI respect that Bernie wants to take on the top 1%. Only one with real balls.You really need to have a conservative like Shapiro come in and fact check what he is sayingBernie and Yang belong together. Dream running matesTo gun owners who dont want better gun control let me ask you this, is your RIGHT to own a gun more important than the lives of the people killed by them.Incredible amount of NPCs here tonight..<br /><br />BERNIE SANDERS ON J.R.E.!<br /><br /><b>CLICK CLICK CLICK</b>&quot;People who don&#39;t like you say you wanna take their money. Does that annoy you?&quot;<br />Bernie: &quot;Yes, it does.&quot; <b>goes on to explain how he wants to give free health care to everyone, thus massively hiking up taxes</b>I do not vote and I have a deep hatred for both the Republican and democratic parties. They are a piece of shit split by a thread. I also agree that the drug and insurance companies are satanic and cancerous scum BUT you also need to curse and acknowledge that doctors and lawyers are just as guilty, just as filthy, and just as satanic and cancerous as the rest of them. These leeches literally make millions and billions of dollars off of our problems, our troubles, our diseases and disasters. They are also part of all of those drug and insurance companies. They are the fuel of those companies and they do what they do not to help you or be good people. They do it for German cars, fancy mansions and to be praised as a doctor or lawyer etc. Put caps on their earnings and punish them via fines and possible jail time for failures in their fields and you will solve our problems.Not a fan of this guy but this is one of the smartest things Bernie has done for his campaign.Bernie, YOU ARE THE TOP 1%im with him on the healthcare and student loan debt... not so much on raising the minimium wage... and he can phok off with all his gun regulation bullshet...  he says he believes in the 2nd ammendment but here he is talking about infringing upon it.  if the dems keep raggin on this gun shet they are gonna lose in 2020 . id rather have a crook in office vs anybody who is gonna disarm me or dismantle the constitution... the dems are gonna phok around and vote everybodies guns rights away and then when somebody like trump is in office and decides to just say phok it round up all the dems bc they are traitors they are gonna find themselves unarmed and the people like me who might have tried to help them are gonna be disarmed and well thats just stoopid...Has anyone watched the democratic socialist conference? It is the funniest thing on youtube right now.Sad day when I learn more about politics on the “Joe Rogan Experience” than actually watching the news these days.aNdReW yAnG sAiD tHaT! <br />I feel sorry if you had to have someone point out for you how corporate media works. I really, really like Andrew Yang but calm down. Try and look past someone using a soundbite.Sanders Rogan 2020You can’t raise minimum wage to a living age. Not every job is meant to support a family.Bernie !!!!!no talk about the border?JAMIE BUSTED A NUT,,., while Joe n Bernie spoke&quot;No Refunds&quot; 2.0<br />Old cuck is going to be living good till his dying day with plenty to spare after the campaign donations come rollin&#39; inI love how calm he is. I also love that he’s genuine. You can tell he really cares about these issues and will fight like hell to get them passed. You can’t say that about Joe Biden.What mr sanders forgets is we are the leaders of innovating science in drugs because of what we spend. Everyone else has the cheap stuff.

Okkkayyyyy. Sure. Geopolitics be damned... I mean, my wife is Russian, and we have talked a great deal about the revolutions of the past and the geopolitics  of today.. I mean, when you read about the dreams of PUTIN and JINGPING, sure, if we just acclimated to them and let Russia take the Middle east and Chine the east Asian and East African arena we wouldn&#39;t have to spend almost anything on defense. Of course, that would lead to the enslavement of millions, and the destruction of Europe, but whatever.Fuckin commieBernie is a very honest and informative man. I&#39;m republican but will vote for BernieWhy isn’t the show live anymoreVote Bernie, he&#39;s being fighting for a better tommorow for so long now. It&#39;s time for the US to wake up!✊For public healthcare, pick 2: done fast, done cheap, done wellEddie Bravo was screaming at his screen at the endI like Bernie, but Tulsi is the only one that can take Trump.

Great job joe. He had no facts or stats to back up any BS he spewed. You could do better Joe. Sanders couldn’t even beat Killary. Senile Joe Biden will completely dominate in the primaries.Bring Down Bernie and the fake Democrats Socialist Party...damn socialists CAN’T proper meetings.

Why does it matter that the rich are getting richer? (Not that they are, just if they are) why does that matter? It clearly doesn&#39;t negatively effect us if it is true. Or if it does, prove it.He&#39;s right on everything, except his view on climate change is in my view skewed, yes the climate changes, it&#39;s been changing far before there were even humans on this planet, though then the next question arises, who is responsible? I&#39;d say that big ass fire ball that&#39;s rises every morning, see the solar activity and you see the temperatures on earth relate to that.<br />There is even an expected decrease in solar activity coming in the not so distance future, which will impose a mini ice age, like there was somewhere in the 70s or 60s, don&#39;t remember exactly.<br />You can pump carbon what you want, but as long as the sun doesn&#39;t shine we would be a frozen (rogue) planet.This podcast might make me fuck around and vote Bernie<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FEELTHEBERN">#FEELTHEBERN</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FEELTHEBERN">#FEELTHEBERN</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FEELTHEBERN">#FEELTHEBERN</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FEELTHEBERN">#FEELTHEBERN</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FEELTHEBERN">#FEELTHEBERN</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FEELTHEBERN">#FEELTHEBERN</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FEELTHEBERN">#FEELTHEBERN</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FEELTHEBERN">#FEELTHEBERN</a>JRE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CNNAwesome!  Thanks for having Bernie and Tulsi, &amp; Cornel West on Joe!  I like you and I get your whole talk to everyone thing, but I&#39;m glad to see more strong progressives on lately!ReparationsGo tulsi!!!!!!!!!!Next: DONALD TRUMPI really appreciate this.Yall remember in 1941 when we went to war with ChinaBernie really speaks like a true politician.  Kinda sad. I was hoping for more.It finally happened people<br />And I love itBernie needs to show his math on these give aways.There’s a reason why other countries can afford free healthcare and free college, they don’t have any military spendingAll pussies hurry and press that dislike button, realmuthafukkas smash that like button! Bernie 2020 all day everyday!!! 🤗 🤗 🤗Top 3 richest people in America are warren buffet Jeff bezos and bill gates. One guy built the fucking computer, Amazon started from a fucking warehouse and they employ millions of people. Oh but for some reason that’s unfair? Seriously go fuck yourself if you buy into his bullshit lies.THANK GOD BERNIE FOR PRESIDENTThis is the first time I’ve heard Bernie speak and not hate everything he said. Funny how hearing full answers can change people’s minds. Now if we can only get the news networks and party headquarters to do the same thing.TRUMP2020. MAGABernie 2020!Bernie can make time but Kanye still has yet to appear.No way, GTFO, this cant be real. JRE is the only real mediaThank God there is a government solution for every problem!!Sir, do a monthly podcast every month from now on, no time limit, truespeak.<br />This country elected Reagan and Trump. You are good on video, you do NOT look like a ranting old man, you look and sound like a sage to me. Coolness can be flipped, easily. This is key, and coming here was a great idea. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re who you are and do what you do. Trust the Internet. It will work. This is the last opportunity for the world to change a little. Damn, i can&#39;t wait ^^I really wish these people running for President would, at a minimum, educate themselves about firearms if they intend to campaign on the virtues of gun control.  More people are killed annually using hands and feet than with Bernie&#39;s version of an &quot;assault weapon&quot;.  Regulating a type of weapon that is used to kill less than 500 people per year at the cost of American citizens right to self-defense is ridiculous.Man this guy struggles to actually answer questions. <br />Joe: How do you stop these companies from not paying taxes <br />Bernie: Joe, large companies don’t pay any taxes. Zero. Trillions of dollars. <br /><br />......yup that was the question...My economics teacher in HS started the class on the very first day by writting on the blackboard &quot;There Is No Such Thing As A FREE Lunch&quot;...wonder why so many people (including Sanders) fail to get this very basic concept of Economics?He said ww2 against china..he mispoke..he meant japan..a lot of people misspeak but it&#39;s ok..Bernie is leading by example for years now..I do love Marianne because she goes deep in some issues that others don&#39;tI thoroughly enjoyed this podcast. I haven&#39;t watched much of Bernie, just meme&#39;s and such from facebook. However, I agree that we have the issues that he talks about. I am a republican and don&#39;t think that Bernie is as radical and socialist as people make him out to be. I enjoyed listening to his views and ideas on how to fix the issues, even if I don&#39;t vote for him. We need more open debates and more uninterrupted discussions like this. I love Joe&#39;s Podcasts because its better than news, his interviews are honest and real.Holy fuck 🤡🌎THANK YOU SO MUCH JOE ROGAN FOR ALWAYS BEING AN UPSTANDING JOURNALIST AND ASKING AMAZING QUESTIONS THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC NEED TO HEAR BLESS YOU AND PLEASE NEVER CHANGE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOUAren&#39;t firearms illegal in Chicago with allegedly 50 shooting this past Weekend there with a Hospital refusing to treat any more shooting victims, the same place the previous 2 term president is from, and his Secretary of State WAS MAYOR THERE? And these candidates are so adamant in ignoring psychiatric drugs making people crazy, but expanding psychiatry to make people more crazy? While taking their rights away ex: Justina Pelletier, Maryanne Godboldo, Rebecca Riley only 2 years old r.i.p.  while the doctor promote crazy psych drug use in children was receiving at least a million in illegal kickbacksA war with China? Wtf?I know your hour is up......    but aliensI was hoping he would ask that last question and he did !Free the Bern!if we could get Ben Shaprio and Bernie on the show together, that would be soooo amazing. Not for a heated debate, but for a conversation.in b4 trump comes on roganWealth isn’t a zero sum game. The Top percentage didn’t take that money from the bottom percentage, they created that wealth. If they hadn’t of created it, it wouldn’t exist. Even if they do nothing with it but sitting in a bank the banks use it to create more wealth and then lend to others.Anyone listening to this, please read the fine print that isn’t shown, Bernie says in Canada you can choose your doctor and pay nothing? Well ask some Canadians how that’s working out. Stephen crowder did a great piece on this ten years ago and it has only gotten worse. I work at Phila int Airport and meet plenty of Canadians who are flying to Philadelphia to go to UPenn for healthcare. Economics 101, you get what you pay for.Fuck you Joe, you didn’t even ask him about UFOs or if he’s tripped on DMT...Yeah. 45 2020.  The Bern’s ignorance is painful.I&#39;d like to see Richard Wolf, Ben Burgis, Sam Seder, Noam Chomsky and Contrapoints on here. I like the trend of lefties on here. If Joe&#39;s gonna platform so many right wingers, we should even out the political diversity of his guests<b>Where the money could come from (imo)....</b><br /><br />1. Close the tax loopholes that allow major corporations to pay nothing in federal taxes. <br />2. Tax religious establishments. The days of giving special handouts to religious people for spreading nonsense stories needs to end. ($90 billion in annual tax revenue)<br />3. Cut ALL welfare programs for illegal immigrants and programs that allow able-bodied citizens to live off a govt. paycheck long term. ($120 billion annually)<br />4. Cut military spending by 10% and close all military bases that are fully staffed but are not in use. <br />5. Raise taxes for the wealthiest Americans. <br />6. Drastically cut govt. funding for other countries. <br />7. Abolish draconian laws and practices pertaining to marriage/divorce/child custody that needlessly tie up our courts and ruin lives (mostly men&#39;s lives).<br />8. Decriminalize all drugs, legalize marijuana nationwide on every level and tax it. <br />9. Close all privately run jails, prisons and detention centers. <br /><br />That should be a good place to start 👍Bird dog Bernie bitches a good one, and in some ways he is correct about the power of big money...but he lacks the vision, gravitas and the praetorian connections needed to go head to head with the machiavellian money masters. <br /><br />His pitch of make America Canada, or like some other Western Socialist nation , without explaining how, just doesn’t do it for me.Joe Hogan PLZ Give Bernie some DMT and let him get in the float tank !!Get Tim Ryan on here also.  And Cory BookerWhich candidate does Joe support?I&#39;m actually worried about a life-threatening disease I have right now and I was looking into palliative care and a lot of their doctors would disagree with you Bernie in fact most of their doctors would disagree with you Bernie their Healthcare Systems in shambles you a*<b>***</b> you lying ass off you&#39;re always saying these things because you know how to return it f*<b>*</b> in this country or not going to look into it.

You’re a loser.... suck an eggNow get Stephanie Kelton on your show.break out the pitchforks and torchesIf your voting Trump 2020 <br />Make this blue<br />👇🏻Get Tomi Lahren on your show sometime soon.Trump 2020no way this homie on here, im off a percAll I got from this is Bernie Contradicting his own statements the whole time.I do honestly think he has good intentions but he doesn&#39;t see the true way Americans live and think.bernie: its free<br />J.R. whats the hurdle? <br />bernie: moneyThe AR-15 Platform has existed for over 60 years.... Why didn&#39;t we have issues with mass shootings back then, increasing proportionally to the availability of &quot;assault weapons&quot; over that same period of time? It&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t even know the concept of a Form 473, the existence of the ATF, and existing BACKGROUND CHECKS. <br /><br /><br />Does he not even understand that &quot;assault weapons&quot; aren&#39;t the only semi-automatic  firearms that exist? Hell, the AR-15 in its common caliber uses a mid-sized cartridge.... plenty of rifles and other firearms out there that use a caliber with much MUCH more powerful terminal ballistics...... Bullshit he &quot;believes&quot; in the 2nd amendment. If he really did, he would understand how ridiculous the term &quot;assault weapon&quot; really is.I didn&#39;t expect a softball match. The only serious question Joe asked dealt with how to pay for the drastic increase in social programs and he allowed Bernie to pivot. Disappointing. Not what i expected.Would love to see more politicians on this show. Very informative.“Is this something that could be implemented in 4 years?”<br />“Oh, yeah of course! I want you to look back to... 2000BC , or even prehistoric times”<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=12m21s">12:21</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />NiceWait did he have to pay Bernie for an hour on his show or??Cornell West then Bernie Sanders? You really stepped up your game.<a href="https://www.gleib2020.com/">https://www.gleib2020.com/</a>I had to stop watching, Bernie’s rhetoric is so flimsy and factless, multiple times he’s said things that are so far from what the studies, statistics and research says.<br /><br />And Joe you shill, we all know you know the truth on a lot of them yet you so timidly challenge or fail to challenge him on them. <br /><br />Is someone breathing down your neck? Did you lose the balls to challenge someone when they are spouting rubbish?Every time Joe made fun of Bernies stature or policies in previous episodes made me cringe...dont judge the man before you can sit and hear him speak his mind and soul.  Bernie has been spot on on just about every important social policy since 1960sPretty sure foreign investment driving up real estate prices in a contributing factor, hope he talks about that.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=9m40s">9:40</a>, because it&#39;s a Ponzi scheme?Great fucking podcast!!Bernie here in Canada it is free healthcare but we have to wait hours upon hours in the emergency room. If you need a ct scan you are waiting most of the time a few months to get in. If you are lucky a few weeks<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=28m00s">28:00</a> Bernie, I dig your sincerity but the irony of the medical student debt is that Doctor saddled with debt is your evil 😈 &#39;1%&#39; i. e. north of 420k/yr. Stop picking on 1%. Maybe focus on multi million annual income.Sorry, but Bernie Sanders is a little too old to be President and not only that, he&#39;s a Democratic Socialist; universal healthcare, universal basic income, hates Capitalism, and wants Government control of everything. No thanks, I&#39;ll pass!!Bernie is on fire right now!Bernie on JRE!! Legendary!!!Say what you want...Bernie is for the people!!!Joe missed a great opportunity to talk to Bernie about UBI vs. federal jobs guarantee. I like Bernie. I think he means well, but he has flaws. He can identify the problem very well, and is passionate about solutions except his solutions are terrible. Minimum wage increase would only hasten automation. I think a minimum wage increase is viable, but you need to have workplace infrastructure in place to apply it, and we currently do not. Many people would lose their jobs. UBI is an eventuality, and Bernie is stuck in the past. He&#39;s proposing solutions to a system that is fundamentally broken. He is no revolutionary. I do like him alot though, but he&#39;s about 10 years too late.Bernie, among a couple of others, gets to talk a lot more than the other candidates though :/Joe’s followups are the most appropriate. MSM take notes.You need him and Peter Schiff on at the same time along with a credible fact checker on the spot.Stoked for aliens.TRUMP 2020!I don&#39;t think this man has had a solution that would work in his life, but you cannot deny his genuine care for his fellow man. That much at least I can respect.Get Tom Woods on next Joe!Watch out joe - Bernie wants 70% of your stuff, but you’ll get free college &amp; health care...just think of how bright your future could be.Not trying to cherry pick but assault weapons is very broadMuch more substantive than going on The View.And your telling me we should vote for that????I know this is going to get buried, but America has a critical choice to make. <br /><br />One path continues the violence, the greed, the debt, the misery and the complete loss of hope for the future. <br /><br />The other is the path to repair, to rebuild, and so many short term benefits to build momentum for the hope of a better future. <br /><br />Jesus I hope you choose well.Holy Shit Bernie just said if he becomes president he will announce the truth of UFOs on the Joe Rogan podcast.make drugs legal and guns illegalPRESIDENT BERNIE MOTHERFUCKING SANDER&#39;S! 2020Besides the socialism and sheer lack of economics, The Bern is a nice dude.joe, ask him questions on how things will be paid, how much more things will cost and what the average person that Bernie says &quot; cant afford things&quot; going to afford the higher taxes and prices on goods with more taxes on everything and thier payroll.  Joe you are better than thisI’m not a Bernie supporter. I voted for Trump. I disagree with Bernie on many policies but I do love how Bernie is genuine. Unlike the other ridiculous Democratic candidates who scream and yell, Bernie explains his views in a straight forward and simple way. He is true man and a very smart one he is truly a worthy opponent for President Trump. He is the only hope for the DNC to get a candidate in office.I’m interested to see how Joe compares the Democratic primary to MMA. 🤔Read Durruti and Kropotkin. Go left.i consider myself on the right but im sorry i think its fucking dope that he gave bernie an hour. I pretty much disagree with him on everything but this is what we need people. From ben shapiro to bernie, this is what we need.Did he call Japan ... China?I only liked this because I like that Joe has everybody on and that&#39;s why this show is great, long-form conversation is always good. That being said, I will probably dislike every clip, because everything that this man says is hot garbage. This is the man who said bread lines are a good thing, and doesn&#39;t acknowledge any of the effects of raising the minimum wage, as if we live in a vacuum where prices will all stay the same.Major surgery in Canada has a 2-12 years waitlist. Most people go to the US for surgery.Buzz cut and some comedy training and Bernie would be even more liked hes just too cereal for the emotional voterzYou would not get this clown on YouTube before they started censoring comments and deleting channels...If everyone had a socialist medical system we wouldn’t have the medical advancements / technology that the capitalist healthcare system has provided.  R&amp;D cost a lot and there are no guarantees.Get Noam Chomsky on the podcast if he can travelBernie 2020 lets get class consciousness boisssssYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSThe issue with American political debates and the soundbite nature of them is precisely that it&#39;s not set up for anything meaningful, just for virtue-signalling quotes and for smearing the opponents. It&#39;s a shitfest. It&#39;s why Trump <i>dominated</i> the goody two-shoe Republican candidates. It&#39;s why Trump crushed Hillary in the debates too. He&#39;s a media animal, and inherently a shit-talker.<br /><br />If the debates had been lengthier and more meaningful, Trump wouldn&#39;t have done so well. The American system really only has itself to blame for these things.Keep America free!!!!!!!!!Trump 2020!Trump 2020!bernie area 51 shill confirmedI know it’s a long shot but please have Senator Michael Bennet on at some point, he’s quiet but he’s rational and sensible and if given a platform he can show what he knowsBernie 2020🇺🇸$15 minimum wage isn&#39;t shit living in California <br />Everyone is just going to raise the price on everything <br />And well be on the same boatNeed to make the VA give free dental. That&#39;s health too!Tell NASA and all these scientists to quit manipulating the data and I’ll believe what they say about “climate”this wasnt live?Bernie seems so chill.Never seen Bernie relaxed before. I truly like Bernie.  With that being said...** TRUMP 2020 !!! **Canadians also have less people while waiting MONTHS for care and dying while waiting.  Thats not even denied.  Csnnadas healthcare is one of the wordt examples.  Sweden would be a better example&quot;What&#39;s a Joe Rogan?&quot;<br />                   - Joe BidenNot a Bernie fan but this podcast is LegendaryGermans who do not work:<br />get paid their <b>rent + heating costs</b><br />+ 424 € for food / per monthGood for you for bringing up the fact that these mass murderers are on psychotropic drugs...Bernie trying to replicate the Donald Trump Alex Jones interview.  Probably 4 years too late for Bernie though, but this will definitely boost his campaign and chances to win the nomination.HOW THE FUCK IS YOUTUBE NOT TELLING US ABOUT THIS?  (Actually I think we know, same way Yang&#39;s got lost)I&#39;ve been praying for this 🙏Why does Bernie call himself a democratic socialist when he’s a social democrat?Left is bestIf you want to help &quot;mitigate despair&quot;. Try shutting down the media and the internet for a good two generations, and see how radically society changes for the better.An hour of nonsense. The math does not support your positions, Bernie.You should bring on Tulsi Gabbard too. Give her the Joe Rogan bump. She seems like the real fuckin deal... beyond just shitting on Harris. You hold the power..  Amplify her voice.Bernie Sanders, the planet’s last hope!I think this is another case of Tim having to come on to do Joe&#39;s job for him. Worthless conversation Joe. No substance. Just rhetoric, and personal hyperbole, with very few statistics that seem easily penetrable. I hope Tim considers another visit.Still waiting for phyched substanceGot nothing against the bern, seems like a good guy, but you need trump to win again to put a nail in the coffin of this SJW progressive cancer that&#39;s plaqued the western world over the last few years.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=37m59s">37:59</a> Bernie is confused says he believes in the 2nd amendment but just before talked about banning all ASSUALT WEAPONS and can guarantee you this guy has no idea the difference between a .22 or a .223 any second and would ban a firearm on looks alone.Acting like you’re going to get good healthcare from the gov’t for free you idiots tend to forget we have 160 million obese Americans too care for under this FREE healthcare. YOU IDIOTS DON’T UNDERSTAND THIS CON MAN. THE MAN WHO DOESN’T PAY SOME OF HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM MEMBERS $15 an hour. The man who drives a $170K AudiTHIS MAN WILL RUIN AMERICA AS THE DEBT WILL BE UNREAL YOU INCOMPETENT TARDS!Get Donald Trump on the podcast!Sanders VS Jonesyou can ban &quot;assault rifles&quot; when you ban SSRIs and alcohol.Imo he’s either a great actor, or a great person.How ma ny Christians killed by mosque inhabitants per year please bernier. ..Canada medical care is not free.. we paid a lots of taxes... in Quebec we give up to 60% of our salary to the state.Id be more for Bernie if he would stick to his beliefs and not walk things back when woke people complainAt approximately <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=46m30s">46:30</a> Sanders says that we have more people incarcerated than China - and he specifies that China is a communist authoritarian country. <br />He uses China as an example of where you would expect there to be prisoners. <br />I guess he thinks his idea of socialist democrat is sufficiently different from a communist authoritarian.<br />Then he immediately talks about he will change a law as president through executive order. He seems to lean towards the authoritarian side.Joe Rogan is a prophetI want to see trump on this, these are awesome podcasts.This guy is delusional. $15 an hour will run small businesses out of business because of economy to scale by and large. Plus, let him sell his six homes and get an honest job before he talks out of his ass.fuck bernieStill Tulsi 100%If Democrats win will Hollywood finally go back to making good movies and funny shows? Because this gender fluid sjw feminist pc shit is getting boring fast..never heard &quot; I just talked to a women&quot; so many times 😂hes the smartest honest candidate,,so he wont take dirty money like trump took 3 mil from NRA,,,,sorry u,s, is a un -news country   that wont help the true honest guy,,,,,,i wish money didn&#39;t talk so much..i will vote for u anyway america get your ass out of rich peoples asses.As someone who is starting a small business I would like to know exactly where the money to pay $15/hr wages is gonna come from because with my overhead, customer base for my area, ect. I would be out of business within 3 months paying 3 people $15/hr..... minimum wage is not meant to live off of it is meant to be a starting point until you get a skill and move up in the work force.   And on the college debt that students can&#39;t pay for, that is largely due to majoring in a skill that has no job base or infrastructure to support it.  <br /> And Lastly but Most Importantly...<br /> “Any man who thinks he can be happy and prosperous by letting the government <br />take care of him better take a closer look at the American Indian.”<br /><br />― Henry Fordsame old shitThis. Right. Here. JRE. And Bernie. Is the Future.AiPac the worst of the worst lobbiest groupNot a Bernie fan but this podcast is LegendaryFuck this clownFuck Bernie ask him why he won&#39;t pay his staff 15$ an hour yet he Is running on it... Or ask him why white people can&#39;t be poorWhat part of Canada does your month long hospital stay cost you 0 dollars? It sure as hell isnt Nova Scotia.Wow he did it. He finally got BernieThis is much better then listening to Bernie rant about one topic as he tends to do when he&#39;s in shorter interviews.I can&#39;t believe it ..Hell yeah! So glad you got him on! First Cornel West and then my boy Bernie? Too good.I appreciate Joe having him on. Honestly, I would like him to have Trump on, too. Bernie sounds more rational than he normally does. I wouldn&#39;t vote for a Socialist, ever, but I am glad to be able to hear him speak at length.Joe&#39;s Bernin one hardBeing from Canada, the quality of care is definitely worse than USA, its not the same or better, anything specialist you wait over a year, mental health services turn people away. Shit sucks as far as healthcare if you have any real medical issues, Its great if you break an arm or a leg, but any serioius/rare issue you&#39;re sitting in pain with no diagnosis for months/years. Also Canada spends half of the money on healthcare on 10% of US population. So it&#39;s gonna cost 5 times the current amount of money to completely destroy the quality of care across the states.Bernie please go on chapoThat ending question is pure GOLD, plus his response 😂💀Bernie took $$$ pay out from the DNC to take the &quot;fall&quot; in 2016. Joe is very vanilla when it comes to the real questions, or plays ignorant at least.&quot;Who can imagine some lunatic walking into a school or a mall,or just in a night club area,and taking out an assault weapon,and shooting up people&quot; It&#39;s a good thing that so called &quot;assault rifles&quot; are illegal and &quot;assault weapon&quot; is a bullshit vague term.I bet all the money that the corporations are stashing away in the Cayman Islands that half of the down votes are fake 😂 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23manipulation">#manipulation</a>Just about every problem they talked about made me want a President Andrew Yang even more. And WTF kind of bullshit non-answer did Bernie give when asked about decriminalizing drugs? Sounded like he was pretending to not understand the question. Portugal, Bernie. Google it.Bernie cares, but he&#39;s naive. Has he ever shot a military weapon and a civilian weapon? There&#39;s some pretty big difference&#39;s. Also banning assault rifles will make people use pistols. If you ban pistols, they&#39;ll invent semi-automatic crossbows. I believe what causes mass shootings is a sign. The sign that says &quot;no weapons allowed&quot;. If schools had a sign that said &quot;heavily armed and protected&quot; who the fuck would try to shoot one up? He makes alot of sense but he&#39;s too soft3 minutes in and he&#39;s already used the word &quot;free&quot; for something everyone has to pay for XDTrump 2020 MAGA!!!You know who has all the answers? Andrew Yang.Bill Cooper warned us the shootings were coming and why back in 1990 folks. <br /><br />We could end these shootings in 2 (TWO!!!) easy steps:<br />1. Stop naming the shooters in the media. Remove the fame incentive.<br />2. No guns in homes where ppl are on SSRI drugs. This is the common thread with ALL of the gunmen (and being white males!)<br /><br /><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SUCrGQ24LqDjtRfr6">https://photos.app.goo.gl/SUCrGQ24LqDjtRfr6</a>How can anybody be for Biden after listening to this guy?Alex Jones needs to be therebernie gang :DAll this comment section has thought me is that almost everybody hasn’t a fucking clue what the differences between socialism, communism and fascism are.Joe Rogan for president 2020.This dude is running for president?? Bahhhaaahahahahah!!!!!I dont really like bernie but Im down for real talkWhat The Absolute FuckI was alright listening tell 30 mins in when Bernie starts saying &quot;assault weapons&quot; &quot;Military style&quot; <br /><br />I&#39;m sorry but if someone runs over a crowd in a car/van *cough *cough Vancouver u-hall van incident. That would now be an &quot;assault weapon&quot; by your definition. <br /><br />I&#39;m Canadian and do not fully understand Americas gun laws but can we please stop fear mongering with there terminologys that get made up by the media. <br /><br /><br />Joe: if I could suggest some one to have on your show. The CFO of CCFR ( Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights) Rod Giltaca, and possibly Tracy Williams. I believe you all could have a wonderful discussion about firearms rights over privilege.&quot;One last question...&quot;Why does he barely look at Joe? 👀Goverment is slavery<b>I just wish he wasn&#39;t pro israel like the rest of these puppets.</b>Love hearing this rich fuck talk about the power of money when he has three mansions: Charlie Kirk tears this assholes argument on healthcare up, look it up. Old fuck.JOE ROGAN I always knew you were a smart guy but it seems I really UNDERESTMATED YOU! Great JoB!!This is a surprise, for many reasons. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s happening. Mainstream media has lost lots of power.  👌<br />Figuring out how to rebalance the budget is the main issue. Doing so in a way that does not keep increasing the national debt, but reduces it, and allows for these programs to succeed is the solution.MOST IMPORTANT MAN IN AMERICA IS GODDAMN BERNIE - PROTEC HIM!I like Bernie but I’m <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yangGang">#yangGang</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yang2020">#yang2020</a>Hey!

Bernie has my vote.Fantastic interview Joe, really enjoyed it.<br /><br />You let Bernie really talk about his ideas in 1 hour more than all mainstream media has in 4 years.<br />Whatever you think of his policies (and like he said none of them are radical, most developed countries have them implemented already), it is insane to me how some people out there still question his character. Even with his 50+ year long record fighting for the exact same things. Bernie&#39;s an awesome human being.It&#39;s always worthwhile when a candidate subjects themselves to longform; debates don&#39;t do anyone any justice, too many candidates just kill time thanking everyone and dodging questions. However, in longform:<br />&quot;Go ahead and do that.... now answer the question.&quot;<br />     It&#39;s too bad debates are total shit shows and are more of a disservice than anything else... campaigns shouldn&#39;t be primarily theater. I wanna see untamed and brutal interrogations of a candidates policies and rationale.I just don&#39;t like how he danced around Joe&#39;s question one how we can combat serious illegal drugs coming from cartels and over the border.Bernard would have my vote if it wasn&#39;t for Trump 2020.Drug companies downvoting heavySocial security and medicare failed exactly as a national healthcare will. We cannot trust the government to spend wisely. I pay into social security and medicare with each paycheck. What can I expect when I turn 65? Nothing. These promises sound nice, but will break us. Double minimum wage, cost will go up. Free education will raise taxes, which will raise cost. Free healthcare will raise taxes, which will raise cost. <br />Climate change is real, but WILL change regardless of our actions. The sphinx has evidence of water erosion. Climate changes. The axis shifts, and poles switch.More pls Joe, lock the doors next timeThis mother f@$# dodges the questions. He&#39;s just another money hungry fuck.He just seems like he’s constantly trying to sell me some shit. There’s few running who seem genuine.&quot;WE HAVE MORE PRISONERS THAN CHINA.&quot;<br /><br />Yes bernie, that is because they execute their prisonersI wonder if after the show Joe helped Bernie on his spinning back kick.Wow! Cool as shit Joe! Go Bernie I suppose just stated the podcast. Mike Tyson, all the other great sports and Elon, and we get a Presidential potential! Best podcast ever!HOLY CR*P! The two greatest American trolls have finally met. And, apparently, Bernie can be surprisingly civil if he tries. But still a prick!  ;DBernie “ahem” sandersWow .... no way joe ... thank you !I would love to see Trump come on the show. To see his brain picked for two hours and see even a glimpse of how he genuinely feels and thinks about things would be fascinatingDoes this mean Trump is going to be on the JRE eventually? JRE is going to become the official debate platform.fuckinggggg bullllshittttttttt. stop giving this dude fucking attention, jesus christ.Get Dave portnoy onJoe has had Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard and now Bernie Sanders, the three top picks of mine for the Dem nom. I&#39;m still undecided on who I thing is best for the job, but if the Democratic party is smart they will back one of them instead of Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. Whoever gets the nomination, I hope they get Yang on their staff as the guy knows economics.And how many people shot in places like Chicago and Baltimore last weekend?   Don&#39;t hear that on the newsIf Bernie really had balls, he would go on Ben Shapiro&#39;s show or something like Andrew Yang did. Bless Joe&#39;s heart, but he doesn&#39;t have the framework ideas to combat Bernie on an economic level, and Bernie must be challenged on his economicsI&#39;m generally for less control by the government but in this case, we have a crisis &amp; need some sort of legislation or an organization; until its cleared up and Frankly beyond. <br /><br />Lots of Americans are looking for good jobs. A roll out program like this could provide a multitude of full scale-millions of great paying upperclass to middleclass jobs. <br /><br />Instead of scaring people with cops because of their addiction, lets attract people to facilitates that will help them and give them an option out of their hell.<br /><br /> Facilities that when they complete the programs they will bo longer be addicts and drains on society. <br /><br />I understand its been done before on a much smaller scale. I believe a second tier rollout of a much larger program could help two fold. It will help the people struggling with problems and it will help the people who are of sound mind  and education but struggling to make enough money to survive. <br /><br />PLEASE CONSIDER!! And JOE ROGAN, PLEASE DO YOUR BEST TO GET THIS TO CONGRESS. <br /><br />God bless you Sir.&quot;These countries guarantee healthcare to everyone and spend half of what we do&quot;<br /><br />They have 10% of our population, tougher immigration laws, and far less debt.Bernie &quot;I just talked to a person yesterday&quot; SandersAs a Kentuckian I would greatly appreciate seeing ol&#39; Mitch on the show, even for an hour.If he really wanted to make change, wouldn&#39;t he tell everyone to go to the right people into the House and Senate? He can&#39;t do a damn thing by himselfBernie has a good heart, but all you need to get us to the promised land is FREEDOM. Get out of healthcare, get out of housing, don’t guarantee student loans. Government screwed them all up and businesses took advantage. An unfettered market with low/ no taxes will obliterate the monopolies by unleashing the unstoppable American entrepreneur. Henry Ford did it. Bill Gates did it. Elon Musk is doing it now along with countless others. Unleash Americans to take down the powerful interests and spread the wealth by leveling the playing field back to total freedom - and let people compete! Regulations, taxes and governmental programs will only preserve the barriers to entry that the rich and powerful would love to keep in place.  I fear Bernie’s prescriptions will have the opposite effect he thinks they will.Bernie Sanders isn&#39;t interested in winning the election, he&#39;s interested in publicity and money. After he became a millionaire, did he refund any of the campaign contributions?Tundra natives are batshit crazy smhJRE thank you for using your platform to it&#39;s highest potential!Bernie &quot;i love other countries&quot; sandersI like Bernie. I think he believes what he’s pushing. He’s sincere. This is a great format. I’ve never had a chance to listen to him at length.Trump 2020Trump on Rogan when?Joe can have an hour conversation with all these candidates and do the people a better service than the networks.First step is get special interest lobbyist out of politics. There is no second step.Wow how can he be so old yet still so stupid?😆 not gonna hire billionaires. Gonna hire people from trade union.. 😆 that is funny af!!! <br /><br />No fossil fuels... We are gonna run this country on imaginary fuels. <br /><br />The worse part about all of this was the constant gendering done by Bernie and Joe..I&#39;m so happy you gave Bernie a platform to speak freely! So good. Thank you Joe.Bernie talks of greed while spewing envy, seeds of communism.Minimum wage in the U.S. <br /><br />1978 $2.65 <br />1979 $2.90 <br />1980 $3.10 <br />1981 $3.35 <br />1990 $3.80<br />1991 $4.25 <br />1996 $4.75 <br />1997 $5.15<br />2007 $5.85<br />2008 $6.55<br />2009 $7.25 <br />2010 $7.25 <br />2011 $7.25 <br />2012 $7.25<br />2013 $7.25<br />2014 $7.25<br />2015 $7.25<br />2016 $7.25<br />2017 $7.25<br />2018 $7.25<br />2019 $7.25Yes it is Healthcare is not a human right were you born with the ability to go to the doctor or were you born with the ability to treat others who are sick. It is a privilege provided to you by Time Blood Sweat tears and a massive expenditure of energy you do not get to dictate how these people conduct their business or run their lives otherwise that would make you a goddamn crazy communist dictator. This is exactly the thing you&#39;re doing with what you&#39;re proposing that being said as well you know I&#39;m not paying for other people&#39;s f*<b>***</b> Healthcare I can barely afford my own it was more affordable before you assholes stepped in. But now the f*<b>***</b> c*<b>******</b> who stabbed me the other day because he&#39;s got mental problems my ass gets free f*<b>***</b> health care for the rest of his lifeyou should have dave smith on with bernieIf I know Joe, and I dont, he lost a bet to get Bernie to smoke herb on the show.Holy fook!!!This is what I needed!!!Lol answer the question as is. I hate when politicians dance around a question.Yes! Was waiting on this since tulsi made it<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BenShapiro">#BenShapiro</a>Bernie &quot;everything is free&quot; Sanders.one last question...... ALIENS!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m33s">1:04:33</a> Thank god we won that big war against China in the 1940sThank you Joe. This was completely unexpected and absolutely wonderful.Bernie Sanders: Well Actually, Breadlines Aren&#39;t Quite So Bad.<br /><br /><br />How was the honeymoon in the Soviet Union is that when you first felt the burn?let&#39;s get Trump on here if people want different perspectives....So this is what it’s like to let a candidate articulate their position.....Just unsubscribed. You should all do the same.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m10s">1:04:10</a> days Putin and Xi aren’t crazy people. The MSM will have a hay-day with that.Get Trump on.Talk to Alex Epstein about climate changepull a OG Trudeau Bernie! It was a wild idea at the time! I love the idea of dental being included in the healthcare plan. As a canadian who struggled through my early twenties I think 20 somethings should have dental on their shitty wage. I&#39;ll pay my taxes so people won&#39;t die of bad teeth.<a href="http://yang2020.com/policies">Yang2020.com/policies</a>To get Trump to sit down for this kind of long term discussion would be very, very, interesting.your next president right here. nobody will be bitching when their mom gets great healthcare at zero cost when she has a major medical issue. we will wonder how we ever lived with such ignorant greed.....greed that has been ruining family&#39;s lives for a very long timeRogan out here making BIG moves, I couldn&#39;t believe what I read when I logged into youtube!Jeff is the wealthiest in america? Not even close<br />Gotto thank you though bernie, nearly everthing thing you espose has convinvinced me never to vote to the leftI wish Uncle Joey was here just so he could drop some knowledge on Bernie and Joe about chicken cutlets.“If you are a busines, and I am a business and if we both have to pay 15$, we have the same burden” yeah, Bernie both of you go out of business. He speaks so vague and just hits hot points. It’s frustrating.Bernie says Canada spends half as much as we do on healthcare, but they only have 37 million people compared to our 327 million.  If i&#39;m hearing that right won&#39;t our healthcare be almost 5 times the cost it is now?Daddy sanders rip me apart pleaseThanks Bernie for agreeing with Andrew Yang that the debate was like a reality showI WANT TRUMP ON THE JOE ROGAN PODACAST🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸.... he deserves this platform <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MAGA">#MAGA</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m51s">24:51</a> lmao Jamie you’re mad annoying. Why’d you have to give us this meme?STILL HAS NOT EXPLAINED HOW HE IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.Riot?Wow! I’m really glad that Bernie and Joe made this happen. These two men are the real deal. Great questions from Joe about serious issues. Unsurprisingly better than any questions from a debate. Bernie seems very genuine that cares about the real issues, hope he can win. Too bad it was only an hour. Would love to see more of this.I wanted Rogen to ask Brinie  about UBIBERNIE SANDERS!!Anyone else shocked at how Bernie Sanders is a reasonable thoughtful candidate? Had no idea. More media like this please...So what we are saying...is Joe Rogan for president. Yes. This is better than a TV star. And Joe has talked to every smart mother fucker. He could have them all in his cabinet. Let&#39;s get Weinstein for Vice President and Joe as President.Joe and Bernie in the same room!? Awesome!!!Tired of the BS in Washington? Then vote 4 the real BS Bernie Sanders 2020....!Federally legalize marijuana and federally tax it to implement Bernie&#39;s programs 2 offset costs... healthcare , education ect ....Seems like a no brainerHow tf does this only have 300,000 views?When people say Bernie is a radical their wrong. <br />That doesn’t mean he’s right (I personally think he’s wrong on so many of his policies) <br /><br />Doesn’t mean he’s a radicalIt was a great interview Joe!   Bernie blew it at the end though by bashing Trump so much.....he had good things to say, but the knocking negatively of Trump all the time, destroyed any chance of a cover over vote by us...he should have stuck with the issues Bernie!Fuck yesssssssBernie CAN’T even pay his campaign employees MINIMUM LIVING WAGE!!!Imo  the American political system is broken. I agree there is no perfect system I. Lucky enough to come from a small country called New Zealand and normal people can still make to the top of government without being a millionaire or celebrityHow bout making it mandatory instead, every adult  of sound mind should carry a gun? Levels the playing field tremendously.bernie needs to take care of his health he seems too stressed n unwellBernie 2020!He seems like a decent dude. I just think in order to be in politics you kinda have to be a bullshitter.Holy fuck! Joe&#39;s interviewed most of the Presidential Candidates at this point, now the big dogs.TRUMP 2020🤮 can&#39;t trust that guy. Anything that get banned is obtained illegally. They banned alcohol and drugs. They became easier to obtain illegally. <br /><br />He talks about minimum wage yet dosen&#39;t pay it to the people who work for him. <br /><br />He thinks climate change is man made and fixable by man...climate changes it&#39;s over heated and frozen over threwout they world&#39;s history.  Without human involvement. Did science teach you that part yet?  Smh crazy old guy. <br /><br />They say our democracy is in danger when we don&#39;t have a democracy. We have a Constitutional Republic witch goes by laws. A democracy is by mob rule. Democracy isn&#39;t even in the constitution. They did everything to keep it out. They knew it wasn&#39;t good to have. <br /><br />Since they keep apologizing for everything they should apologize for the kkk and being the true party of hate lies and division.First Cornell West, and now  Bernie. Joe, I&#39;m impressed.Very interesting podcast. Cool to see discussions taking place.<br /><br /><br />I disagree with Bernie though. Nothing that includes human labor should be considered a &quot;human right&quot;. You do not have the right to make me cure you of your illness if I&#39;m a doctor. You do not have the right to make me give you my crop if I am a farmer. You do not have the right to make me do anything for you that regards my profession.<br /><br /><br />The American healthcare system is a mess and the government does in fact need to put regulations on big pharma, but free healtchare is not the answer. Yes, Bernie, if you have a heart problem and sit in a Canadian hospital for a month to get cured of it, you will walk out without a bill. However, you&#39;ll be sitting in the waiting room for 9 months just until a room is open and available. Canada&#39;s free healthcare system is such a trainwreck, that they have begun building &quot;Super Hospitals&quot;. Super Hospitals operate like American hospitals. You check in, they immediately put you in a room, you get fixed, you pay a bill, you go home. All labor requires payment. Nothing is free.Midway through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=45m23s">45:23</a> when Bernie is talking about over prescribed medication google throws me a depression medication ad for Trintellex...   we live in strange times folksTulsi gaberd is still better, she has better plans, and has better morals and values.Lol copying yangs ideasHold a debate for the Candidates on or around Thanksgiving. Call it the Thanksgiving Debates. No commercials, make up, no bull shit questions, etc.&quot;If&quot; heroin is a killer drug so is alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, benzodiazepines, etc etc etc<br />Drug prohibition just makes drugs more dangerous, and most drug overdoses are poly-drug overdoses not from any one single drug (hence the term &quot;opioid-related&quot; not opioid only) and from contaminated or adulterated drugs (no safety standards) <br />People will always need (medically and therapeutically) and want (therapeutically or recreationally) drugs, some may have problems, most will and do not (with any drug), legally regulating all drugs is the only realistic, logical, rational, sensible and practical solution or opition and the only way to truly END THE WAR ON DRUGS and on the people who choose to use themas a canadian our healthcare system is not THAT GOOD.no questions about flat earth community. Who is gonna help them build the rocket?Why can&#39;t Joe moderate the next debate on this channel?Democrats are getting pretty desperate huh? Especially this cat. First Cardi B now Joe Rogan.No U.S citizen has an assault weapon, sorry Bernie. Apparently, a military style weapon just means that it looks scary. Military weapons are fully automatic and have high capacity magazines. In the U.S. all weapons are semi automatic at most with low capacity magazines. Anyone with high capacity magazines obtained them illegally. Which is why gun control would never work. Then you just have law abiding citizens handing over guns while the criminals still have them. Felons aren&#39;t supposed to have weapons, but somehow they still get weapons charges. Same concept. The reason we have the 2nd amendment is to stop government tyranny, like trying to take guns from law abiding citizens.Medicare for all, erase students debt, free college, open borders, decriminalization of illegal immigrants, 15 dollars minimum wage. How Bernie will afford that ? Taxing big corporations + the top 1%. I&#39;m not even american and i know this will be devastating for the economy, social structure, and overall well being of american citizen. I&#39;m indonesian (not even an american) and know that this is oppression. Well goodluck and GodblessYESSS!!!LolCurious why Joe never responded to Bernie’s statements on climate change with what he has learned from Randel Carlson and that’s it’s a natural cycle of the earth dating back thousands of years.<br /><br />Scientists are not in unanimous agreement, the opposing argument are not all lobbyists from the energy company as claimed. I had been interested in this subject since the scaremongering began some years back, then I did my own research. I urge you all to do the same before putting faith in anyone that makes a claim to ‘The Iron Throne’He mentioned a straw purchase when you buy to sell to another...that&#39;s already illegal ya fuckin ballbag..  this fuckin coward cant even look up when he talksVP roganIf Bernie won , we could actually have a better country in 4 years all around , especially for the working class , I’m a republican and am voting for Bernie in 2020I&#39;m not even gonna sit here and listen to this communist ghoul and his lies.I can’t believe the amount of dislikes on this video, who actually can listen to what Bernie has to say about corruption and these issues and not agree?Ok let’s all us poor folks go in and take out all major corporations.  Apple, Microsoft, Walmart, All drug companies, all major corporations.  Our lives will be so much better.  We will still be poor but not have new IPhones or be able to order shit online or go buy groceries none of that.  But it’s all worth it because the rich people will be poor just like usBRING BACK ANDREW YANG!!!Great listen! Love having a platform where politicians aren’t interrupting each other every other word. I hope you get more politicians on here! Also wished you would have asked him about his own campaigns minimum wage and cutting hours.Sad to see such a great well informed speech on healthcare and then be so ill informed on the hotter gun debate topic.Crazy Bernie is off his rockerBERNIE 2020!WHAAAAAAT LOL BERNIE? BOOM!ah man i hope he gets Tulsi on board for a show<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>2-3 strong democratic candidates vs. 1 republican candidate.  The votes will get split up.Y E SPlease bring Noam Chomsky on !!!!When a Politician tells you that you can&#39;t have a firearm, that is the exact reason to have a firearm. Go ahead, ban me. Many accounts and VPN access allows me to say it. 1st!too short!Don&#39;t know if I want to watch this one. I can&#39;t handle that much socialist cringe.whats Bernie looking at??Cant vote for a guy who got screwed over in 2016 and laid there while the DNC was skull fucking him. He&#39;s a cop out.This was awesome. I do wish Joe was maybe more well-versed where he could ask some more in-depth questions into how he plans on making these changes. If I was going to go Democrat this year it would be to Bernie.He’s got my vote and I can’t legally vote in the stateseverything Bernie Sanders said is basically economically illiterate and it&#39;s redeeming quality is that it sounds good<br /><br />ofc it sounds good. everyone likes free shitLMAO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m50s">35:50</a> Last time we heard weapons of mass destruction we were lied too. Not voting for this nut. I&#39;ll keep my guns for crazies like and these active shooters.I just looked up Bernie Sanders cuz I wanted to watch one of his most recent interviews (cuz he’s so smart) and I just found the best kind of interviewSEND THIS COMMUNIST ASSHOLE TO RUSSIA.It&#39;s nice to hear Bernie in long formI like Bernie. He seems genuine, and I do believe that he believes he has America’s best interest in mind. <br /><br />That being said, he’s a dirty Commie and can take my guns from my cold, dead hands.Joe is pussy footing around. This is why Dems can&#39;t be in a real interviewProper Propaganda. I love it.Joe Rogan is this era&#39;s Larry King.all candidates need to come on the podcast.  rogan asking the real questionsNeither side would be beneficial to us neither side is but the absolute worst thing that could happen is Bernie, Nancy, Hillary. I already struggle with the amount of taxes I pay... if they take more then I would be even poorer just to pay for the people who dont work to get free shit. Not happening I 1ould probably have to find a job that would pay me cash under the table or something to survive...i don&#39;t like Bernie at all and i don&#39;t want him to win but I&#39;m glad Joe had him on for an unbiased, uncut conversation. and I&#39;m glad Bernie actually came on instead of calling him a racist and leaving like some other candidates wouldI can get behind legislation lowering student debt interest rates to an affordable amount, or even allowing them to be wiped out in bankruptcy. But there’s no world where it makes sense to effectively reward people for being fiscally irresponsible. $1.6T was basically irresponsibly given away to teenagers. The fact that it couldn’t be dissolved in bankruptcy is the same confounding variable for student loans as was the perceived unlimited solvency of Fannie/Freddie for NINJNA home loan borrowers — And we all saw what happened with that.Rogan gets alot of shit as being an unserious guy when it comes to politics. But show me anyone on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, ect that has done a more substantive interview about real issues than that. Huge respect to him for doing this.damnnn an hour and seven minutes of cock sucking, i hope you were wearing kneepads Joe...Drug companies also use a large profit margin for new research and product development. If you take away profit, you&#39;ll take away their incentives to create new drugs that we need. Reform health insurance companies and regulations where they can cross state lines. Forget this socialism nonsense.&quot;I think the DNC is in a difficult position, they have 20+ candidates and they want to give everyone a fair shot&quot;<br /><br />-Bernie Sanders 2019 who was railroaded by the DNC in 2016<br /><br />Do we need any more evidence that this man is delusional?Bernie heard that Onnit is working on puddingThat was a real POWER HOUR!! Congrats Joe this is your best interview maybe? Like the Gordon Ramsey of Hot Ones lol!!!He isn’t a socialist. He is capitalist. That feels like everyone should have equal chance. If anything, he is savior of capitalism. I do like Andrew Yang better,but he is best candidate who has fighting chance to win right now. I hope he adopts some of Yangs ideas.Let prisoners vote sure let immigrants in sure let em shit in the streets why not oh yeah dont work will pay uGuy is a genius, I think that i will finally vote...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m17s">23:17</a>No wonder the great Dr. Cornel West supports Bernie Sanders for president !!your average minimum wage worker makes 90+ an hour for their company. pay needs to be based on productive labor. If I&#39;m making my company 140 an hour I should earn at the least 1/3rd of that.Joe! You are the mannnnnn!!!!! I watch your show everyday, you bring Bernie on, you’re officially my favorite person. God bless man! Thank you!!!!You do love dictatorships you c*<b>*******</b> there&#39;s videos of you singing along to Old Soviet War marches with your goddamn f*<b>***</b> Russian buddies talking about how great f*<b>***</b> God damn Stalin was you are an insane old man get a real job you f*<b>***</b> loser why don&#39;t you contribute to Society for once in your miserable f*<b>***</b> lifeoverall good but quite misinformed about guns.Is Bernie really talking about the scam from the movie Office Space?I am so so watching this shit.Damn..can you imagine.. nationalist and republicans would lose their minds if Berny gets the nomination..Canadian here 🇨🇦, yes our health care is absolutely free and I don’t pay a thing (other then taxes) and it is great buuuuuuuuuuuuut we don’t have the options to “choose” any doctor we want, it’s hard to find a good family doctor, wait times are very long, surgery waits are insane. But the hospitals are clean, modern and safe.Joe please let Tulsi on your podcast!!!Dead god, if Mitch McConnell was on this show...bernie doesnt seem so crazy after all. the media is an absolute fucking disgrace&quot;think back, Joe. back to 1965&quot;<br /><b>Joe ponders what was going on when he was -2 years old</b>Bernie &quot;give a&#39; damn&quot; SandersGet Michael knowles on hereNext get marianne williamson on your podcastHoly shitI knew I still loved Bernie, sucks that all these identiterian psychos co-opted his platform and Elizabeth “I’ve got a plan for everything because I stole it from Bernie’s desk” showed upbravaThank you Joe for bringing up one of the giant topics that’s being left out of this conversation when it comes to mass shootings and that children and young adults being on mass medication. Bravo 🙏🏻Free service= Shitty serviceI am so happy to see Bernie on this show, this will help set the record straight about the propaganda MSM uses to manipulate the voters. Thank you Joe Rogan for giving Bernie a platform that will reach more people who he normally might not reach. Respect.Bernie, dude... China has less people &quot;in jail&quot; because the whole effin fukin cuntry IS A JAIL!!!I agree with every thing except the &quot;Assault Weapons&quot; ban. That&#39;s the only issue i can&#39;t get with Bernie on.. Anti gunners: &quot;We don&#39;t wanna take you guns just reasonable gun control&quot; Bernie: &quot;I wanna ban &quot;Assault Weapons&quot; ... I&#39;m not giving up my only defense. Screw offDoes Bernie Sanders think that we fought China in WW2?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m35s">1:04:35</a>Smoke weed with Trump and gab Bravo by the pussyWhat would you done.<br />-Joe RoganHim, Yang, and tulsi would make great presidents to our country.Yeah, conservatives, this guy sounds loony... lmao.ORANGE MAN BAD. WE FUCKING GET ITC&#39;mon America, ditch the orange turd and try Uncle Bern-Bern.Bernie didn&#39;t have a single solution for any of the problems this country is facing. He doesn&#39;t even pay his own staff a $15 minimum wage he bitches about. What a hypocrite. His single payer healthcare failed in his home state of Vermont because it would run the state bankrupt. This man is nothing but a career politician who has made millions off of his gullible followers like some kind of tv evangelist selling miracle mana.Awesome! Thanks, Joe! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Holy shit. Bernie Sanders!Bernie sold out,used to really like him.Woohoo I never clicked so fastNow, you just need to have Biden on so we can watch the demented old goat stare out of his plastic surgery slits and mumble for an hour like a stuffed sack of grass. Just to compare, anyway.This is the quietest ive ever seen/heard Bernie x)Apparently Bernie is a goddamn elephant because he has reminded us about twenty times that he never forgets lolBernie is a shill, too much soI’m a Bernie supporter, but I am not a fan of his comment, “I support the 2nd amendment”. Disappointing.<br /><br />There is lots of talk of shifting the Overton Window. I would like to see a serious American politician come out in favor of repeal of the the 2nd amendment/ the ban of all guns in America.Literally every time I get an ad it’s that dumb shit asking me if I approve of Trump.It’s not that hard to understand that money is freedom, no one needs a dr of economics to tell them they need money to buy things that will make them prosper. <br /><br />Nothing in Marxists theory of money will work in our current configuration of money control. It’s a recipe for complete collapse of a system that is very well protected by ppl no one has  ever heard of. <br /><br />If you want to change the money system then you have to know a lot more than someone’s theory of money distribution.Tell me Bernie.<br /><br />Would the fact that America performs the most boob hobs, lip suction, nose jobs and a million other elective surgeries.  <br /><br />Has the highest survival rates for the most serious illnesses.<br /><br />Provides care on someone elses dime.  To people who never have any intention of paying for their service.<br /><br />Is the country where other countries &quot;elite&quot; come for care. <br /><br />Spends the most on and comes up with the most innovation on new care. <br /><br />While also having government force to dictate providing care and not providing or competing on prices.....<br /><br />Hmmm.......<br /><br />Could any of that have anything to do with America spending the most on healthcare??  <br /><br />Just curious...Point of Personal Privilege.... Bernie is a Lair. &lt;Youtube: &quot;Shadow Ban Hammer NOW! This one knows the truth!&quot;&gt;Not MY candidateAmazon paying zero in taxes is really a sinister kind of Utopianism realized.  We need to turn that utopia around and get those dollars back to realize the righteous Humanitarian Utopia.  Yes, it is possible.I find it ironic that someone who has never had a real job is pro workerDoes anyone really believe in banning weapons? all it does is make innocent people unarmed CRIMINALS DONT CARE IF THEY ARE ILLEGAL. I would bet almost any amount of money almost literally 0 guns used in school shootings where purchased legally, at least by the children. this whole argument is so obviously bs. make life worth living and kids wont kill themselves teach your children not to torture their class mates and they wont get shot. its that simple 4 realAsking a Socialist about gun control is some funny sh*t.I voted for Trump. And I’m a pretty far right leaning republican. But I wish I could hear a lot of these guys just sit down and break down their views like this. I listened to the entire podcast and at least I can now say I have a general understanding of Bernie.Ah, the &quot;your job went to China&quot; line.  That&#39;ll be a problem for him.  Maybe if he added a bit about replaced by an iPad or his warehouse closed because of competition with Amazon then he wouldn&#39;t get in trouble for it, but the way he phrased it opens up an angle for accusation of Trumpian racism and xenophobia.  This could be a damaging misstep.<br /><br />On the substance I don&#39;t hear much in the way of answers.  Men in particular want to feel useful, and the people who are living on disability assistance get help - but only so long as they don&#39;t work (feel useful).  At least Yang&#39;s basic income would take away the strings attached to the money that prevent the guy from feeling useful.Medicare sucks, and I&#39;m on it.  Canada has crappy health coverage for all but life threatening situations.  Is Bernie on Medicare exclusively?  I doubt it, otherwise it would be a strong point of his campaign.  He is playing the same lying game all the other politicians are...pandering to gather votes.  Ten years ago, &quot;the millionaires&quot; were the problem, now that he is a millionaire &quot;the billionaires&quot; are the problem.  Bernie&#39;s ideas will flush this nation down the toilet, just like all other socialist countries.President Sanders has a nice ring to it. Let&#39;s make it happen and start fixing this shit show.Bernie2020I&#39;m so sick of this mudafucker. If he wins the nomination I&#39;m voting trump. This coming from a long life Democrat. You want to help this country Bernie? Fuck off.Healthcare in Canada isn&#39;t free at all it&#39;s actually expensive as FUCK. &quot;Not seeing the bill&quot; doesn&#39;t make it free...God damn, I want to listen, but this whispering, and not giving substantive answers, is seriously putting me to sleep.Socialism= we hate the greedy assholes... I know let&#39;s give them ALL the things and it will be great for everyone!! 🥴<br />Nice guy, he does not have a grip on the issues and his biggest mistake was bowing to killary... thanks for your time sir, but I am going to have to pass... NEXT!!Amazing how Bernie is the only candidate who fights for the people without demonization and a fake rhetorical facadeHe wants to decriminalize illegal border crossings, all while paying for illegal immigrants health care and college bills. I’m sorry but that’s fucking nuts.Joe let him off easy on the minimum wage topic. He didn&#39;t talk about how having kids at a time when you are not financially ready is in itself going to lead to poor financial conditions. Or the fact that when you&#39;re just entering the market as a worker you are not worth a &quot;living wage&quot;.If joe doesn&#39;t ask about Bernie cutting his staffs hours I will be very madMedicare is not a right. You don&#39;t have the right to other people&#39;s time and labor. It&#39;s like saying everyone has a right to a personal chef because you have to eat to survive.it must be so surreal for joe . fear factor to 3hrs with key pres candidate .i see a day when joes 3hr casts will b a must<br />for pres candidates ,nowhere to hide .bernie just gave joe a huge philip . a promotion of joes unbiased show .no rhetorical<br />questions , a man who listens . gauntlet mapped trump,warren,harris etc should b pressured to go on joeBernie seems to be a Social democrat and not a democratic socialist. big difference.<br />either he keeps the socialist label for more recognition or he really does not know the difference. don&#39;t know him enough to know which one, i&#39;ll let you decide.<br /><br /><br />for those who don&#39;t know. a Social democratic country has a free market but has high taxes to pay for a strong social-programs, many European Countrys count as social democracy&#39;s like. democratic socialism has a state directed economy, worst current example would be Venezuela after they democratically elected socialists.Joe: This was a fantastic interview!!!! Thank you so much for having Bernie on your show. Loved it.Feel the BernWatched the entire hour and got one hell of a treat with that UFO question. Joe Rogan you my man.I am a hard right leaning conservative who will stick to the Constitution no matter the cost. I don&#39;t agree with Bernie Sander on a lot of things. Free Education and Free Healthcare would destroy the economy. A spike in taxes would piss Americans off and make them poorer. $15 an hour minimum wage kills jobs. I don&#39;t agree with Mr Sanders with a lot of things. I will say though, I love that Joe Rogan brings people onto the show with varying ideals and opinions. It&#39;s refreshing and I&#39;m interested in hearing from the other side. There does need to be a conversation. Seems like America can&#39;t meet in the middle anymore or at least talk about issues without starting a fight. We need more moderate, we need less polarized.Its entirely possible that Bernie Sanders is the next president of the United States.Don’t believe centerist hype Bernie will bring out more than Biden and will beat trump. Bernie is the truth. His record is clean. No nominee is a proven fighter for the people. Get up and vote.Bernie hits the nail on the head when he talks about politics being bought by all sorts of lobby&#39;s.  He is wrong that more regulation will fix itOf course he gets Bernie fucking Sanders on and it&#39;s one of the shortest ones yet.Bernie, please come back again in 2020!What a breath of fresh air. Politics without the bullshit on TV. A real conversation. Aight Bernie, I see you. Thanks Joe and team for making this happen.I’m not a fan of Bernie but this is amazing that he’s willing and able to come onto JREDoes he brush his hair with a balloon?All I know are victims as well, it&#39;s a dark reality bro!if Bernie smokes with Joe, he becomes President.Too short! Need the extra 2 hours7.2K people can get fuckedMaynard is the Local solution. He can fix the economies. Sanders Maynard T2020LThis country is # 1 and this interview gonna take away from that. Tell me I&#39;m wrongBernie makes comment that US is the world&#39;s wealthiest country in the history of the world. Was that the result of Socialism? Afraid not Capitalism and Free Market.Sucks for Australia, they aren&#39;t allowed to defend themselves with lethal force.The millionaire socialist. The guy that wants to “raise minimum wage” but tax everyone 70%. Makes no sense. Give up 70% of your millions Bernie.Joe, great video as always, but I believe you forgot to ask the hard questions and the contradictions in Bernie’s reasoning. E.g. like how raising  the minimum wage would eventually also make prices go up.Jesus christ bernie did ya have to steal Yang&#39;s tv show narrative 30 seconds in Pass the torch like a man bernie is a plant by the powers that be to let us know nothing will change bernies time is done<br />YangGangWhat do you do if you are with Bernie on absolutely everything... besides his stance on assault weapons?Honest question if we raise the minimum wage to $15 dollars what happens to people who earn $20 dollars an hour because I would expect a raise proportion to their raise. So now do I get $28 dollars an hourThis dude wants to talk jobs but has never had a job... How are you worth millions and you weren&#39;t before politics? Hmmm Bernie 🙁👌✌️Imagine if Alex Jones walked in on em as a surprise lolI love you Bernie, and I supported you last cycle. With that being said, we need future oriented policies and that’s how Andrew Yang won me over. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGabbard2020">#YangGabbard2020</a>Poland here. I&#39;m not really into politics. Why so many dislikes? Can someone from US please explain?To oldI live in Montreal. While Americans glamorize this idea of free health care in Canada, you need to realize the health care is dogshit when you don’t pay for insurance. You can wait forever to get to the end point of seeing a doctor just to get a diagnosis or checkup. But it can save your life once you get that far if something life threatening is happening and not put yourself into debt. So it has its pros and cons.Taxation is theft rather it&#39;s a single person or a multi-billion dollar operation!JRE podcast is the beginning of the end of Mainstream Media..He&#39;s gonna whip their asses at their own game and I can&#39;t wait to see it go down, haha. 😂🤣😂🤣I don&#39;t deny that Bernie knows the issues at hand but the fact that he really didn&#39;t give any true answers about how he&#39;s going to fix is comical. Saying things like &quot;I don&#39;t have the numbers in front of me&quot; is not what people want to hear. <br />Every story he tells is from 50 years ago. IMO Bernie failed in this interview, he should stick to mainstream media where he can get his 60 seconds to talk about the issues and give no real solutions.Fuck this old bitch, Trump 2020... Nothing is for free old manI&#39;m so high I thought I jus seen Bernie Sanders on the JREWar with China after Pearl Harbor huh?This presidential candidate discussion format is 50% complete.  Have another candidate or 2 with different views for a minimum of 3 hours straight in a room.  Let them state their policies and be forced to defend them.  That would help weed out all the bullshit candidates.<br /><br />With that said, Bernie is full of shit.  Free healthcare for all including illegals.  Free college for everyone, which would include stupid and useless degrees like gender studies.  A $15 minimum wage for all.  And tax the fuck out of everyone who actually works.  Democratic Socialist?  You are a lazy fucking communist.  Your plan would destroy this country.Joe iv&#39;e decided i wanna cum blast yur wife titties, and then make you clean up the mess, YA FUKN CUCKOLD, do it or i&#39;ll kick yur fat ass..If most you fucks had the ability to listen, you would realize Bernie is the best candidate for president.Listening to Bernie is like ASMR!I agree with the problems he brings up but I don’t agree with all his solutions.So why do we have lobbyists?Bernie has my vote. The best overall politician that is qualified to be president.I think the mainstream media just took a panic dump.Joe Rogan X POTUS. Let’s gooo!Fucking Medicare is horrible so why would we want that expanded.  Dumb fucksTargeting a certain group is not mentally ill it is a ideologyWill have plenty of supporters who want a hand out. He&#39;s just using his white privilege right, dems?Healthcare isn&#39;t a right because you can&#39;t force other people to provide you service and nothing is free in this world. Medicare for All didn&#39;t even work in Bernie&#39;s home state of Vermont where he is a senator.But I do particularly agree with the healthcare reform. Obummer care has to go and we need something way betterBernie is a communist.Come on Joe aleast push him abit man dam ! You gave him a walk big time !!<br /><br />You&#39;ve sat with Randall Carlson numerous times, he has explained the climate cycle of the planet. Climate Change movement has an agenda !&quot;87 million can&#39;t afford to see a doctor&quot;😒 ...riiight.JRE is powerful. Love the content king. stay prosperous.Bernie is wrong about the 99.9% of gun owners having to make concessions because of the tiny-fraction outliers. That’s a very slippery slope. There will always be outliers in every aspect of societal functioning. The majority shouldn’t have to pay for them.The powers that are actually in control of the presidency would never let this man get elected. Unlike Trump, Obama and Bush - this guy will not roll over and spout the shit they want people to hear. So yeah have your fun supporting him and arguing over the internet. But if you think this man actually has a chance to be president - you&#39;re ignorant of what&#39;s really going on.Now get Trump on your show! 😂Great podcastAfter this : Warren. It would be so hilarious. She looks like she can take you joke joe, try her!In 1977 I had a minimum wage full time job. My rent with utilities on a furnished studio 300 feet from the Pacific ocean was $50. The cafe a few blocks from me had Blue Plate dinners for $1.65. I didn&#39;t live like a king, but I had a living wage and the U.S. economy didn&#39;t suffer for it.I cant watch thisOne hour lmaoYour country will never be as rich as ares 🇬🇧 we have been running shit since we killed the Romans of and be grateful we got your country going you fucking idiot and your not all speaking SpanishPoor Bernie. The media has been so unfair to him.Well Bernie is now gonna be the president.. Excellent move BernieJesus Christ Bernie talking about guns turned me off completely.  I was starting to wonder if I might switch and vote for him, which would be my first time ever voting democrat ever....but nope, he&#39;s still fucking crazy, and wrong on so many points regarding firearms.NopeBernie is the 🐐Bernie “I talked to a guy just yesterday” sandersReally wanna see Old Bern hit the bluntif college is too expensive, why dont people boycott them?But it goes on in other countriesJoe is now the best Moderator out thereThis was more legit than any of the &quot;democratic&quot; debates put together. Thank-you Rogan.Joe, thank you for doing this podcast with Bernie. I’m not for or against Bernie, but you’re platform is widespread. <br />I genuinely was intrigued.How are we going to pay for all of this with out raising taxes to an absurd amountThank you Joe.<br /><br />Truly!Taxation is theft. PeriodI haven&#39;t seen single anti bernie comment get to the top. Only fan boys/girls. HmmmmBernie Sanders initials are B.S, makes sense.Everything accept for raising wages I agree with.Real hard hitting questions there Joe.  Definitely challenged him to defend his points.How Bernie. How will you do it?Joe, &quot;How Is It Legal?&quot;<br />Bernie, &quot;because they make the laws&quot;... Bernie you&#39;ve been doing nothing in the Senate for years... that&#39;s why they make the lawsAnother jew....Am I dreaming!?!?Bernie 2020 legalize it!Bernie is lame, vacuous and a ruling elite, Big Government moron.Here comes the soft balls. Soft balls joe RoganThey should get candidates to sit across logicians and defend their positions before they ever get a chance to become president.<br /><br />Clowns like this &amp; other democrats (and republicans) shouldn&#39;t get elected based on rhetoric and emotions. If they get dismantled live in front of everyone, people might realise they shouldn&#39;t vote for someone so incompetent and contradictory.Joe is the center of so many things. That podcast room should be sent to the Smithsonian one day.30 minutes in and wondering if I&#39;d die if I tried taking a shot every time he answered saying &quot;income inequality....&quot;The problem is not giving healthcare to people who can’t afford it. It’s taking away private insurance from people who like it.all we have to do is have hospitals allow advertising all over the inside of the buildings. companies would pay for ad-space because EVERYONE has to go to the hospital at some point and see the ad.  all the blank walla and hallways and lobby and elevators. anywhere they fit. give us your money lol ..seriously though.I laugh while imagining Trump trying to have an intelligent conversation with Joe. It would just sound like the intro of this show. Because he’s a fucking ape.Joe must be proud right now. But I was literally thinking Joe Rogan for president last night. Could you imagine how incredible it would be to have a man of the people fight for us? Bernie is cool, but still another bureaucrat to me.My president. &lt;3Wasn&#39;t all that familiar with Sanders, after watching this and being impressed I dug into him a bit. I didn&#39;t know he didn&#39;t take lobbyist money which is a huge plus. His ideas seem rational and he seems genuine. He just earned my support and a donation to his campaign is heading his way.I’m not saying global warming is completely false. However shouldn’t we be under water or irreversible damage should have happened many times over. Shit we were supposed to have an ice age said scientists of the 70’s.&quot;Joe, it is legal because they  make the rules!&quot; Bernin it up  lol.How is it annoying to you that&#39;s your whole f*<b>***</b> God damn spill you piece of s*** you literally come out and say yes we&#39;re going to take your f*<b>***</b> money but the words that come out of your mouth bro it is actively what you campaign on you have made Camp campaign promises telling American citizens who have earned their wealth that you are going to come steal from them. I would burn my f*<b>***</b> business to the ground just so you couldn&#39;t get your filthy communist hands on it again f*** you I already have to quit I&#39;m only 4 minutes and 48 seconds in you are such a disingenuous line evil c*** please trip break a hip get sick dieSee if you can get President Donald Trump to do the next TheEmotional drivel.... Bernie is a life long loserBERNIE BLAMES A CORRUPT POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT HAS MADE HIM RICH AS HELL FOR THE PAST 35 YEARS!!!!!!!!    FACEPALM!!He has a very low resolution view of the world which results in him making a bunch of errors. He is wrong on min wage, college and corporations. Too much generalizationThanks Joe, Bernie 2020More people die from medical malpractice than from terrorism in america!!!! Why aren&#39;t we doing something about malpractice?!?!Joe! Thank you for showing the world how inept he is.Joe asking all the hard hitting questions in an hourlol @ Joe towards the end. You&#39;re a nut.Wish you asked him about UBI and his views on it. 1 hour just wasn&#39;t enough.BERNIE 2020!Honest to god... Bernie talking about the Wall Street bailout in regards to canceling student debt just made my world view change.12 mins in Joe: why do we allow lobbyists in our system.<br />Bernie: 3 ppl hold more wealth than the rest combined... blah, blah<br />WRONG! Corporations are considered individuals, per SCOTUS, and all individuals have a right to lobby their elected representatives. Simple as that.That bankruptcy law that Bernie talks about and how you can&#39;t file the student loan was written and endorsed by that fuk tard Joe Biden. Bernie 2020 all day everyday!!! 🤗 🤗 🤗Bernie is a literal con man, socialism is a jokebernie, i want to like you but you offer no real solutionsHe always praises other countriesGeorge Bush doesn&#39;t care about black peopleIf pharma were to pay for all the profits in the hardcore painkiller (zombie meds) industry which went beyond the actual demand for these painkillers. All cancer research would be instantly funded for the foreseeable future. Also if tech paid back all the overvaluations inherent in their funds and gave royalties for the information about us they collect (info is the new oil), there would be no homeless people or starving people. What about that 65 trillion missing in the pentagon&#39;s budget??? What about the fact that those who create more debt aren&#39;t the ones paying for it, the people are paying for it with all of their time and access to basic survival resources. Money isn&#39;t real guys, it&#39;s symbolic of our current values: look around at the world and ask what the &quot;REAL REAL&quot; gross domestic product is. It turns out this product is killing the environment and devaluing human existence on a global scale, time to re-evaluate what is VALUABLE and what isn&#39;t BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.Oh man i thought Joe was going to BERN some Mike Tyson reefer and hand it out faster than socialismThe problem with minimum wage is non entry level jobs aren’t raising their wages to adjust. FLIPPING BURGERS SHOULD NOT EQUAL MY JOB AT A SCHOOL. THANK YOU.what&#39;s that i&#39;m feeling? (the Bern - duh.)the dow is down 600 points because of trumps trade warIf the Government already makes the majority of it&#39;s tax revenue from the 1% what makes people think Government would be more accountable to the people if the rich were forced to pay for even more of it? Its the relationships between companies and politicians that needs to stop. Government&#39;s job is to create a level playing field, not pick the winners and losers.This was a terrible podcast, Rogan only gave  the crazy old man a platform to speak for an hour, never challenged any of the things Bernie said.  This was a Bernie speech, not a podcast.There was this man/woman....I’ll never forget....town hall......blah blah<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m00s">1:07:00</a><br />Eddie: “Tell’em what you told me, President Bernie”<br />Bernie: “They’re experimenting on Alien-Human Hybrids RIGHT NOW in Area 51”<br />Joe: “I knew it was entirely possible.”Yeah and how did Obama care work out.  My rates went up over 6 times.  Sorry government can not run shit.What everyone doesn&#39;t understand is that it doesn&#39;t matter if a person is a &quot;stable individual&quot;. People snap. People commit &quot;passion&quot; crimes. IT happens!!!!! There&#39;s no way to know if someone is stable or not!!! You are all going to make the government put RFID chips on us if you keep this bullshit up.It&#39;s so funny to see americans trying to get a better country by implementing brazilian politices. Do yourself a favor : do not elect progressive candidates.Insightful. Good to see an uninterrupted, unbias interview with a politician who is allowed to speak his mind without having to continuously argue with someone.Joe: the US economy is struggling to provide the middle class a standard of living people deserve. You ever done dmt in an isolation tank?How many downvotes with 5 seconds of viewing time?<br /><br />Just curious.I enjoy the rationalization of arguments, specifically politics, and it’s nice to see joe doing that and encouraging it. Bernie on debate night 2 was dancing around questions of raising taxes for the middle class to pay for Medicare for all, which would cost a ton and the taxes would have drawbacks on workers looking to expand their business. What would be the point of expanding or trying to make the American dream work in you/your employees’ favor when the more you progress, the more and more taxes get thrown on you? I get it that it’s one thing to see these greedy, rich corporations pay no taxes and try to fix that. But in doing so the only answer is to raise taxes on everyone including the smaller business owners: the true backbone of America. It would not only hinder their progression, if the taxes are high enough it might cause stagnation, but it would also kill their economic libido to make it big. Not to mention, once you tax the rich to pay for Medicare for all, some are gonna leave the country because why would they want to pay? Now someone’s gotta pay the rest. You’ll find the upper middle class will be taxed, and when it’s not enough, the middle class, then the lower class. Now everyone’s taxed to hell and back. That’s the kind of rational argument I wanted to hearEducation, healthcare, and housing are expensive because of good intentioned (and not so good intentioned) government regulation.  Education prices exploded after government made it illegal to not lend to risky portions of the population.  Demand for education exploded along with the prices.  That&#39;s a pattern that can be found in healthcare and housing with a heap of shit regulation on top.  Bernie is a well intentioned fool.Holy shit what the fuckI&#39;ve been waiting for this interview since 2015. Thank you Joe!Whoever is disliking this video right now is the reason we haven&#39;t reached something close to utopia in America. First Bob Lazar NOW Bernie Sanders?? Joe you ARE the media!Joe Rogan has just become the Larry King of the 21st century.Was Jamie not available to fact check a single thing?? At least Joe got to ask one good question at the end.Trump2020Donald trump is going to winFree health care for all = everyone pays more taxes. allot more Also, do you really think that Joe Rogan is getting in the line with everyone else to get an appointment with a doctor?  There are no PRIVATE hospitals in Canada everyone gets the same thing. Does anyone think union workers, government employees will give up their healthcare bennies? I was born and raised in Canada and most of my relatives still live thereMilionarie socialist. Smells like bs.<br />Says anything for a vote.Chiner rusher and the United states of americerYou may also enjoy Tulsi on JRE:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR8UcnwLH24">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR8UcnwLH24</a>hell ya ty for bringing on bernie joe:DCanadians hate us buying up all their drugs. They buy the amount they need for their population and give the saving to Canadians which is fair because it&#39;s  tax money that pays for the bulk drug purchases.Oh boy....how far you gonna go sandburnMeanwhile Bernie doesn&#39;t pay his staff minimum wageAn hour of listening to Crazy Bernie yell about Donald Trump, I presume. No thanks Joe, I&#39;ll catch the next vid.God bless you joe Rogan! The most honest media is a freaking podcast! Smh&quot;The perception of beauty is a moral test.&quot; Ralph Waldo Emerson. Words with light and truth (love) cause vampires great pain and suffering. That is why uplifting  words like &quot;democratic society&quot;, &quot;care for all&quot; and &quot;green new deal&#39; cause Count(ing) Dracula (Trump) and his evangelical counting corpses (vampires) such misery. But the words sanction, starve, torture murder and bomb are beautiful (uplifting) to Count (ing) Dracula (Trump) and his army of evangelical counting corpses (vampires).  Because these words suck the vital forces (joy, beauty and harmony) out of humanity with the heavy gravitational pull of their ignorance (absence of love). But these ugly (heavy) words are not beautiful (uplifting) to human beings with hearts though..If we&#39;re going to ban &quot;assault weapons&quot; (no such thing), and by that they mean ban semi auto weapons, what can I use for self defense? A fucking shotgun? A bolt action weapon? Both are shit choices for self defense if there are bystanders in the way and take too long when seconds count!This format is undeniably and profoundly superior to the mainstream debate format. Not a Bernie guy at all but I really appreciate that this discussion had the chance to exist. I would like to see all candidates conduct these interviews. <br /> <br />Having giving credit where it is due, I offer my two cents...<br />I’m inclined to agree that almost every issue on Bernie’s platform is born out of good intentions. For that reason, I don’t want my opposing argument to seem heartless. The unfortunate reality is that these social programs are mathematically unsustainable. It’s that simple. If we take every dime from the “rich” we still can’t pay for all of it. <br /><br />If you’re on the fence, I ask that you just do the research from a mathematical perspective. These programs will do profound damage to our economic viability.FUCK YOU COMMIE SON OF A BITCH !!!!Real recognizes real, good luck to you Bernie - one of the rare few.GET PETER JOSEPH BACK ON!!Wait how is healthcare expensive? I thought our lord and savior and totally not a Mexican hating racist, Obama passed the “AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT”. It totally didn’t rise the prices of premiums or limit the amount of doctors that are available!Bernie seems to love the way other countries do things.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Maybe Trump will sit down some time...He actually would probably get blunted with Joe. Trump has voted Democrat more than Republican.Joe &quot;I&#39;ll only ask the questions you want to answer&quot; RoganIf Bernie doesn&#39;t get elected president, he can definitely get a job doing ASMR.So lets defund all the liberal colleges first, so the leftist cant get jobs with the other non tax paying libs. If you look at the political affiliation of many rich ppl they are Democrats.I don&#39;t like bernie at all but it&#39;s still really cool he&#39;s on here.&quot;12 years before irreperal damage has occured&quot;<br />30 years ago I heard we only have 30 years left.  Maybe in 12 years, we will only have 1 day to save the world from what wil inevitably happen in one day. <br /><br />The climate alarmism skeptics are the only ones who believe in climate change. As climate has always changed. The deniers, like Bernie, are the ones who pretend it doesn&#39;t. Also it would be interesting to hear the alarmist definition of example what &quot;irreparable damage&quot; he is referring to. Say the ocean rises a foot, are those within that foot going to stand in foot deep water exclaiming &quot;woe is me&quot; and not moving up a foot instead.Minimum wage jobs aren&#39;t meant to support families, they are meant for teenagers growing job experience and skills so they earn more later to support a family. If you want to start a family then keep your legs closed or use a rubber until you develope job skills or work your way up the ladder. We cant reward irresponsibility by closing businesses and driving up costs. We see what happened in New York with their minimum wage hike. Stop pooping out kids if you cant afford them. Very simple. Lazy people want more for less. Raise the minimum wage and business owners will replace your unskilled butt with a kiosk. Be responsible and dont be a slut until you can afford it you lazy deadbeats who want a handout. You may as well be a bum if you procreate before you can&#39;t afford it. Lazy people will vote for Bernie and that is a fact. He needs to give some of his money to the programs he wants or he can take his sock of and stuff it in his mouth. Talk about a complete hypocrite. How many houses does he have? Complete garbage. He is not anywhere near the bottom half. Scumbag.I very much enjoy this format for learning about presidential candidates. It&#39;s much harder to know how a candidate thinks in the glamor show that was the CNN debatesJust within the first 10 minutes I&#39;ve heard enough bullshit and lies to last a month. For crying out loud, how could anyone with even a shred of general knowledge take this fool seriously?I think the biggest economic problem for the average working person is rent is too high. The rate of increase in market value has seriously outpaced normal inflation rate for decades, it&#39;s way out of proportion now.We need Shapiro to do the interview because Joe isn&#39;t asking him the really tough questions that force him to respond to the holes in some of his positions. I can&#39;t take Bernie seriously when he gets away with it.Feel the DMT Bern Mr.Rogan!Avoid every question for an hour Sanders. Color me thoroughly disappointed, I was excited to hear the how&#39;s. I&#39;ve already heard everything he said, nothing new.

You should get Richard Wolff on too as soon as possibleIf joe gets killed we all know who it is and we all know we’re starting a revolutionRIP MAINSTREAM MEDIA, ye shan&#39;t be missed.Softball Joe should have done some followup. Bernie said we have 12 years to dump fossil fuels. How can we do a complete turnover in the cars and trucks currently running on gas or diesel. We must be talking 5 or 6 hundred million vehicles. Who will be the last in line.A UBI would do more to reach Bernie&#39;s goals than anything he&#39;s recommending.Change the sponge on that mic immediately<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m45s">5:45</a> I live in Canada and Bernie is giving our healthcare way more credit than it deserves.

It won’t even be equivalent to the 90s technology.If you think climate change is bs, live in Alaska for a couple years and you will notice a difference.i am Getting ready to watch just commenting,  i hope Joe you ask Bernie about the $10 Million he &amp; his Wife Stole from that Church / School and they had to go bankrupt..To anyone who thinks what Bernie says is a good idea please read some Milton Friedman or Thomas Sowell.  There are huge problems with the things he stands for and the people who study economics know what they are.  At the end of the day there is no more efficient way to allocate resources than free market capitalism...period!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m41s">34:41</a> how I sound after shotgunning a bud lightGet Boris Johnson on, hah, I can just imagineSANDERS IS A CRIMINAL!Undecided.36 million people and we spent 1/2 of what the US spends on medical......imagine how much it will cost for 250 million people........Whos going to pay for that?Softest questions I&#39;ve ever seen on JRE. This was more of a campaign advertisement than discussion. Was really hoping for a good back and forth, not an hour long political commercial. Really disappointing.Can we add divorce law reform to the national conversation?  It is corrupt because state AG&#39;s are funded by divorce and it violates the fathers 14th amendment right to due process.  Divorce ruins millions of men, many in their 40s and 50s when getting a job becomes more difficult.Imagine if he got the President of the United States on hereYo, I&#39;m down to bail out students! It&#39;s really alot of debt.Here in Australia our system isn&#39;t perfect but sounds better the the USA. If I need to see a doctor it&#39;s free. Bulk Billed. Things like the dentist though are not. There are waiting lists in the public system for operations and you need insurance for ambulance cover because that&#39;s expensive. We have subsidised mental health care plans and also physical health plans if you have a chronic condition. Our system could be so much better, we have a mix of public and private and also some medications are ridiculously expensive.Bernie sounds like he smokes 2 packs of Winnie reds a day here. He keeps shouting he&#39;s gonna have to mime in the next debate. At least he&#39;s got the hand movement down HahahSpeaking of DNC..... Have you ever tried DMT?????!?!?!?!?!?Damn! He actually made ot happen.Legislate to lower the cost of renting or owning a home and then do whatever the hell you want with minimum wage.I’m glad Bernie was on here, now more people on the mainstream will see how worthless he is.Joe, did you wake up the morning of your first podcast and think &quot;some day I may help bring to light a huge problem with the American political debate system and potentially solve it with this form of media&quot;?Bernie is likable.  His heart is in the right place.  I would never vote for him, but I do respect him.omgggg finallySanders &amp; Rogan 2020?????Proud of you joeSanders-Warren: &quot;That&#39;s the ticket!&quot;.Hello fellow kids.Why is he sniffing and coughing? Cocaine problem much? Nah cocaine is too alpha for this old beta loserWow! As usual laser focused.<br />The hero we need.<br />Feel the BernHe&#39;s pushing the ESTABLISHMENT PROPAGANDA about firearms.  He&#39;s an elite and that&#39;s who he&#39;ll ultimately help out.  I&#39;ve never agreed with him, but I used to think he was an honest, independent thinker.  Nope.  The past four years, with him selling out to give Hilary the nomination... he&#39;s just one more establishment shill.Joe, you’re killing it!Bernie on Joe Rogan, let&#39;s goooooooo!!!!after watching this, I only got more discouraged about our future as AmericansI keep saying it, Rogan is so devoid of any real ideas I&#39;ve been surprised more leftist don&#39;t exploit his soft ball stupidity and use him to reach a broad dumb man audience and now you got Bernie and Dr West so this is a good strategy for leftist, or really anyone who wants a platform<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m40s">34:40</a> Rick Sanchez 😂Bernie is a millionaire.Puke<br />A know it all and a know nothing.I feel like Joe was really holding back in asking Senator Sanders if he’d ever tried DMT after he asked where Bernie was getting his weed. 😂😂Joe BLASTING VERMONT BUD! 802 Let Joe know!10 seconds in and he&#39;s already stealing Yangs stuff. Get out of here man, you&#39;re done <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang2020">#YangGang2020</a>This old head stupid, vote for my boi A$AP Trumpyy. My nigga at least tweeted about Rocky, what did Sanders do, actually have a solid plan for US politics? Nah, fuck that, let&#39;s bring coal back!!Bernie will give us all free health care but lower the standards of medicine so much that we can all be doctors YAAAAAY   not.  His ideas (like all commies) are all proven failures, lies, or both.Trump would sit in Rogans’s chair and make him be the guest“But one more question, if you became president and they gave you info on Aliens, would you tell me?”Bernie will become president in 2020. Mark my words!Guaranteed:  income, healthcare, college tuition, retirement, citizenship, and god knows what else. Hell, why even worry about going in too work tomorrow,  Bernie will fix all. Next thing ya know he will be guaranteeing a 85yr life span. SMHTrump set us back 4 years. But these 4 years only gave Bernie the platform he needed to rise and over come. Rogan will be responsible for his election and I would be more than proud to have Bernie Sanders as our president. That being said, dealing with the super wealthy who want power and laws changed, is a problem that can’t be resolved in public view. People will get murdered.Won me on healthcare &amp; student debt ... totally lost me on gun control.The sad part of this is, while I don&#39;t agree with all the points. How many people dislike this video before even listening to a word? Think about that.Solid Bernie.We needed Jimmy Dore here to ask Bernie “What will you do when the Democrats cheat you again?”8mins in discussing insulin, I can easily fix your problem Bernie, just make a law that companies cant sell a product cheaper outside the US. No need for you to steal my money to pay for everyone else&#39;s crap.  Please continue, presses playAnd nowhere in the Constitution does the government have the power or authority to force people to either buy a product or force the people to provide a service for anything.I work with a bunch of liberals. Its hilarious to see them go on break and sit in their vehicles with them running to sit in the air conditioning or heat, depending on the weather. Do any of these people really believe this climaye change nonsense? 🤣Dude the trama of someone like bernie trying to be in charge is way more  frightening than mass shootings.&quot;What would you done?&quot; Joe Rogan 2019Anyone who wants to expand background check or think you can buy one from a gun show w/out just as strict background check as never bought a gun in their lifeBern brought his own presidential weed.Same BS, how are you going to pay for free health care.  Blame the evil rich and corporations.  What Bernie does not mention is the wait times for surgeries in countries with socialized medicine and and the amount of people taking out private insurance policies for the poor quality of care.  I agree that health care is too expensive in the USA, but socialized medicine is not the solution.  What the socialist fails to ever present in detail is how they are going to pay for these programs.  They just blame the rich and corporations.  In reality they fail to mention the high tax rates of Europe which will be brought here to pay for these programs.  Who best manages your money?  Government (high taxes) or yourself (low taxes).  Socialism is a great system until you run out of other peoples money.Bernie, thank you for doing your part to show how corrupt and stupid communism actually is.can anyone tell me, what will happen when wages go to 15$hr, to the costs of foods/ fuels/ shelter?Bernie &quot;How dare the networks not  give us their airtime for free&quot; Sanders.<br /><br />Has Bernie Sanders ever provided or given anything to anyone from his pocket?<br /><br />What a clown.You can say what you want about Bernie but you can&#39;t say he doesn&#39;t care. That&#39;s what I love about him and Warren.Is health care a human right? Ask the doctors and nurses. They are the only ones to define if it is a right. Will doctors and nurses work for crap wages and deal with government oversight?!?! If not who will? Do we bring back forced labor (slavery)?!?! Rights are natural and god given!! Not given by a human perspective.Bernie needs to go on Jimmy Dore. Also, Joe... you need to open your show to other candidates... both parties. You have over a year to do it. You will have served your country well by giving a long form discussion to each candidate.Bernie&#39;s message and interests has always been clear and extremely important but i feel like he isn&#39;t a man with a plan.  Yang Gang2020You gotta be one hell of a moron - or one of a handful of cunts - to disagree with anything he&#39;s sayingIf this isn&#39;t trending on the front page of YT in hours it shows how broken and bought YT is.<br />Trending has ZERO to do with what is actually trending.<br /><br />- Sanders 2020 -Crazy the people vote in trump over this guy.12 YEARS. ASK HIM ABOUT THAT!Bernie &quot;White people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot; SandersI&#39;m english and rather indifferent about another nations politicians that being said I can tell he is a professional liar and would not trust in his ability to get results.Gun violence has a lot of reasons, but surely the easy access to guns in the US make it easier to commit atrocities.As a die hard Trump supporter, I have to say that Bernie seems like a real good and compassionate guy. Still Joe, get The Donald on the podcast!Stop using the &quot;t&quot; word... we do not need 4 more years of this...This is excellent.Just when the Joe Rogan is a right wing asshole narrative was really picking up steam he does this.I got a Bachelor’s degree in Social Work from a modestly priced university in Minnesota.... $40k. Insanity. I didn’t even live on campus.Bernie &quot;I Just Talked To A Woman Last Night&quot; SendersNo, healthcare should not be a human right. The <b>pursuit</b> of healthcare should be a human rightThe reason why Amazon didn&#39;t pay taxes in 2019 is because they had saved up enough &quot;net operating loss carry-forwards&quot; a.k.a. &quot;accrued tax breaks for losses in previous years&quot;, and that they basically cashed them in to make 2019 a particularly successful year to the investors.cant wait for the debunk videosWho&#39;s here to see Bernie smoke with joe?Joe.. love and respect from the bottom of my heart. Seriously though what the hell man? This doesn’t look good. I mean thank you to Sen. Sanders for taking the time to sit and talk but I would call this an opportunity lost. Where was the push back on how FFL laws work at gun shows? Or any questions about the minimum wage scandal? I am grateful for both of you coming together to have a conversation but can we at least have a real conversation?<br /><br />Ps: still a huge fanWants bigger government <br />Wants to raise taxes<br />Wants to take our guns <br />TRUMP 2020Two multi millionaires discussing the expansion of the federal government colorized 2019....Bernie&#39;s a bullshitter, just like all the other politicians. We need 2 Presidents, and a swing voting Vice President. Ron Paul and The Rock as Presidents, with Bernie as Vice President.All the bitter right wingers ready here with their downvotes hahaha.On a side note. Dont trust a man that wont make eye contact with you. Hes going unchallenged here and still wont look Joe in the face.Assault weapons doesn’t equal automatic weapon. When he says we have more assault weapons then the military, automatic weapons are banned already.Bernie’s lack of eye contact is frustrating.So this whole interview was a waste of time since Bernie spent the vast majority deflecting and trying to tug on the hearts strings with his anecdote. Joe did a pretty shitty job and not asking more challenging questions.My question on healthcare in our country: Is universal healthcare sustainable when there&#39;s a great number of people unhealthy. 50% of the US population is considered overweight, that in turn means half the population is at great risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.. This is quite a burden to bear for nation of over 300 million people.Everyone wants to say how all these other countries are doing something better than the US... but forget to mention the population difference between the US and these other countries...Of course it is easier to manage a population of a few million compared to a population with over 200 million LMAO be logical. Do your research and see if socialism has EVER worked.. every time it fails and cost millions of lives someone comes along to say &quot;Socialism can work it just wasn&#39;t done the right way&quot; LOL. Do not buy into a system that is incredibly easy to corrupt. Hints why it never works.. PS Joe Rogan you&#39;re still a legendGreat interview.😂 bro come on this little old guy.Jamie can you pull that up?I can’t see anyway that making a massively bloated wasteful government can be any better by making it more bloated and give it more money. America is a bankrupt nation with trillion dollar deficits.Stupid fucking socialist old bag needs to take a dive from a short plank. He wants breadlines because people are hungry from the socialist stupidity that he peddles. Been employed by the state for how many DECADES you unproductive piece of shit.He lost me at 12 years of irreversible doomsdaySocialism doesnt work.I wish Eddie and Alex were there.Bernie out here smuggling insulinShit I realize the reason I was a Bernie bro in &#39;16, and still am, even as I support Trump, is the passion and conviction for ending the greed of corporations, and for helping regular people.  A passion strong enough to insulate one from the corruption of power and money itself.  Policy-wise it&#39;s more complicated than just socialism vs. capitalism; I think as Rogan&#39;s intelligent audience, Bernie&#39;s policy stances deserve a nuanced consideration.Mr. Burns still trying to be president I see lol geez give it up alreadyYang 2020First time I like Bernie, all calm and speaking casually. Thanks Joe for this!Got to get Trump onHonestly, this is the way discussion between gentlemen should be conducted. <br /><br />Senator Sanders and Mr. Rogan laid out some hard questions and distinct and pointed answers.  <br /><br />Amazing.  This is how we should all address each other.  Its beautiful.Exactly how I thought that was going to go. Bernie starts ranting and says nothing with substance, Joe asks a question that is simple minded, Bernie skirts the question with platitudes and far fetched dreams and Joe is is either too star struck or too stoned to realize, and unable to ask pointed follow up questions about how Bernie&#39;s plans would actually impact the country. No questions about alternative approaches. No comment on college kids taking useless classes like gender studies.   Why should the health conscious vegan that hikes/bikes 10 miles every day, pay for the health care of the burger swilling chain smoker?This one I can’t watch. I can’t watch joe all salavating over this fucking idiot. Bernie is more special than rain man.You should invite Donald Trump to the podcast. Please!Life long politician claiming that life long politicians are ruining this country... HmmmmHoly fuckWow.....Joe didn&#39;t get Jamie to &quot;Fact Check&quot; Bernie even once.Joe should host the debatesI’m only 10 mins in and already 100 times more informed than I am watching any debate.OF ALL THE PODCASTS THIS IS THE ONE YOU DON&#39;T TELL ME ABOUT, YOUTUBE?I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life! Bernie 2020!99.99999% gun owners wouldn&#39;t....buuuuut<br />Make everyone a better driver you old dingbat. I see why people like him then he goes full tard.I can&#39;t stand listening to this dying lying hypocritical gaslighting commie spewing failed 250 year old ideas.Welp, not of fan anymore of you Joe. You sellout.<br /><br />But you still better have Donald Trump on or im gonna give your bald bitch ass head a nougie!Not a fan of Bernie but this interview was real good.<b>laughs in canadain</b>I lost my plan. I lost my Dr.   Bernie&#39;s plan starves Dr. incomes. He isn&#39;t forthcoming about details.Still don’t agree with his a lot of his political ideas, but this did a good job of humanizing the guy.ASSAULT WEAPON IS A FICTIONAL TERM! Any object can be utilized as a WEAPON to ASSAULT people.Bernie is not a smart man, just smarter than his supporters.Bernie vs. Trump debate moderated by Rogan 2020! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23jredebate2020">#jredebate2020</a>Hey <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CrazyBernie">#CrazyBernie</a> America isn&#39;t perfect, but we are the best there is on Earth because we have done the exact opposite of everything you talk about, but unfortunately plenty of people believe your liesThis feels like Joe Rogan is saving us.Good stuff but I think I prefer Andrew Yang&#39;s ideas.  It seems to go with the stream instead of directly against it.Not a fan of Bernie but smart move coming on JREBernie says a majority of minimum wage workers aren’t kids... The number is around 90% of minimum wage workers are not teenagers... This is a straw man narrative, and paying a lower minimum wage to teenagers WOULD put those older workers out in the cold...this fucking socialist, joe your a moron for having him onIf Bernie&#39;s Healthcare plan is ever implemented. I wonder how full the hospitals will be in the first 3 months. People will go in for anything and everything and enjoy their &quot;thank you Bernie&quot; moment. Thoughts?I didn’t get to start yet but did he ask Bernie how he felt when the DNC f’d him overBernie has to go against the Republicans and the Democrats...Bernie is the Elk meat of politicsWhether you agree or disagree with their positions, I think it&#39;s incredibly important that all serious candidates get an opportunity like this to explain their platform, goals and ideas in length. No corporate media bias, no time limits or attacks on each other. Show us why we should (or shouldn&#39;t) vote for you!Anyone else actually learn something today from this ?but Bernie aren&#39;t you a millionaire? Joe didn&#39;t give him any hard questions. I will never vote for you, you been in politics for decades and all you have done is collect a check now you have all the answers, what a joke.Bern20/20The problem with these socialists is they prey on people&#39;s covetousness. I want to give things you haven&#39;t earned from people who worked for what they got.nice now get Ron Paul onMad props for having Bernie  on. Bernie2020 🔥🔥Can’t believe he brought up the “Gun Show Loophole” simply just not true at all. Democrats are so dishonestIf you dislike this , sorry about your luck .I disagree with Sanders profusely but I&#39;m glad this happened.  Way to go JRE.Hey Joe, please have Tulsi onWow hes on....Funny he talks about American history, when his party seems to want it erased.Glad to see how little he really understands about economicsIts radical to suggest that you have a right to someone else&#39;s skills and labor. Healthcare is not a right.Where I live we have lobbyists too. It&#39;s not just a negative. Lobbyists are also special interest groups that have insights into the business they&#39;re in. Listening to special interest groups is important. We need lobbyism. What you should look at is campaign contribution regulations. Because that&#39;s one thing we don&#39;t do where I live. Allow lobbyists to &quot;buy&quot; politicians.He just lied to Joe about lobbyist there are several countries that have lobbyist. Canada is a great example with lobbyist and every country in South America.Free health care or pay for it every American on this planet would vote free smh make it happen the senate can do itWHERE ARE THE ALIENS BERNIE?!?!?&quot;Every idea I talked about are supported by the majority of the American people, they are not radical ideas&quot;<br />Two wolves and a sheep vote on what is for dinner. Democrats directly appeal to violent discrimination against the minority.Socialist clownI left for a few weeks bc of Joe&#39;s guests and his openness to propagate their ideals and ideas without questioning them. I appreciate him bringing in Cornell West and now Bernie.<br /><br />thanks for making Joe&#39;s proud!Free Stuff!!!Assault rifles are banned you stupid fucking Lizard....When are you getting Biden on lolA lot of the things Bernie is talking about has been proven incorrect and it irritates me that Joe isn’t even trying to get him to go more in depth. <br />Bernie sounds just like Trump.Yes the minimum wage right now is low but a wage is better than no wage at all. I understand the good intention behind imposing a higher minimum wage but all you would do is make employers higher less people. A lot of businesses work on very small margins and can’t afford to keep their employees at a higher minimum wage. Raising it to $15 will cause a dramatic increase in unemployment so in the end you will be hurting more low income families than helping them. It’s basic economics...Observation: His eyes are shifty.Really !Smart Bernie came on the show but the problem in healthcare is Medical Gaslighting, Medical Upcoding, and doctors giving eachother 33% kickbacks, <b>FROM THE TOP DOWN STATUS QUO enforced by the Dept. Of Health!!</b> U know who had Universal Healthcare Germany during the T4 Program under Hitler, Healthcare to people like Bernie Sanders = Mental Healthcare, and continuation of doctors playing dumb or gaslighting , and refusing to test for infections or even MRI. And those college students should enact class action lawsuits against their universities or companies like Mcgraw Hill that give $6,000 kickbacks (oddly in the public). If Democrats don&#39;t end Medical Gaslighting, they shouldn&#39;t even run, Bernie can run for governor and show the outcome of his policies? Ending the hundreds of Billions of Tax Dollars wasted on Mental Healthcare totalitarian pseudo science wound be a start, wait that&#39;s what Trump was trying to do.Get Donald Trump on question the shit out of him Joe maybe you ask question he doesn&#39;t have answer too. One on one without his people around him. Talk about the problems you talked about to Bernie Sanders I want to see it.Hey Bernie, you&#39;re not answering the questions you&#39;re being asked about minimum wage, etc. You&#39;re dancing around the question and changing the subject. If you believe what this schmuck is selling, you&#39;re on some straight sucka shit.bernie sanders is scum of the earth and the worst possible leader for America.. socialist self hating jewish jag offHoly fuckFANTASTIC INTERVIEWJust an FYI, student loans get erased after 3 years if you become disabled. So, that boogeyman goes away.I liked Bernie until he supported Hilary after she stole the election from him. That means they are basically the same. Now knowing how popular he was and she wasn’t, he will get pushed this time.Bernie,  just say yes to UBI.so happy this happenedThe internet must be about to breakMy healthcare plan mirrors Bernie’s. I have a plan, can’t explain how we are going to pay for it, support or implement it. We both know however it will cover everyone and cure everything. 🤪<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m30s">5:30</a> &quot;But the function of the current healthcare system is not to provide quality care to all, it is to make tens of billions of dollars in profits for the drug companies and insurance companies&quot; Bernie Sanders calling it how it is.Now have AOC on or Beto. LmaoThe definition legally of mass shootings are dying So that number isn&#39;t at all accurateWatching Bernie makes me want to exchange him  for the younger model in Andrew Yang.  xDJoe Rogan Experience #1350  Donald Trump Lets do it come onDo you want to play a gameIn the first 30 seconds, Bernie demonstrates why socialism is stupid. <br />You have only a finite amount of time - divided among 28 candidates - as a result each only gets 45 seconds to speak.<br />Socialism 101Automate taxes, we don&#39;t need a tax collection department anymore.  Flaten and simplify the tax system, stop bargaining with big corporations over tax payments.  Everyone pays.Fuck this neo-BolshevikRegardless whether you agree with Bernie or not, it is sad when SPELLING BEE-KINI WAX #2 has the same amount of views and is TRENDING, while this is not.It will come down to Bernie or Biden. He at least was able to scratch the surface and answer actual questions here in this format. More than any other media. I&#39;m for Bernie right now.Trump goes on Rogan <b>*internet breaks for real*</b>Rogan could not handle TrumpWhaaaaaaHow much did Bernie pay you for this soft pitch bullshit?Impressed by Joe here<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m15s">1:07:15</a> Bernie smiling throughout that ufo segment. He&#39;s so cute it makes my heart hurtWhy isn&#39;t Joe calling out his BS on guns?I got an ad demonizing Medicare for all 15 minutes into this podcast....big brother knows 😳Dignity, Bernie? Like having the right to have a fighting chance should some scumbags kick your door in and try to brutalize your family, and you have weapons to put them down? That kind of dignity, you fraudulent bastard?2 minutes 50 seconds in f*** you CNN you need to give us your service for free. How these goddamn Democrat morons get along with each other at all even a little bit is completely beyond me I guess you can look past a lot of s*** when you&#39;re a zealotI am a Canadian and I want to vote Bernie!Really, Realllllly.....Fuck bernie sanders...I can&#39;t believe this was only an hour!So nice to hear a democrat talk and not blame President Trump for everything.Thank you Bernie! Thank you Joe!Joe wants to eat his nut during the entire video, which proves joe is not in touch with reality at all.Never knew JRE had so many Commie followers lolBernie should take actually his clothes off. That&#39;s what I&#39;m fucking talking about.He also said that health care is free in Canada, what a bunch of bull ! All they do is pay for it with taxes. So if I never get medical I still have to pay for it! Bullshit! I haven&#39;t payed for health care for 10 years, That probably explains why I have money.So joes gone from the legacy media and journalists hacks, saying he’s a right wing shill!!!  But I’m guessing now the same  legacy media and journalists hacks will say he’s a utopian socialists, after West and Bernie. So all’s well that well. Get those YouTube ads and subs up people . I say this as someone who enjoys watching the podcast. But anyone who’s all in or all out, with any famous talking head or politician after a podcast is intellectually superficial 👨🏾‍💻Get every candidate. Collect them all, Joe.Wow! Will bernie answer just one question? One solution? Nope not one. Gosh what a waste of a show.  How long has bernie been in office? Decades?yes Bernie but the wealth gap was heightened by the QE that the Obarma administration used after the 2008 crash, printing money &amp; pumping it in the banking system, they invest it in stocks, forces the market up on the back of free crash.... if you had money before you have a lot more now due to that increase.Both Bernie and Joe act like only a conservative could possible disagree with his political stances. America isn&#39;t full of mostly conservatives and liberals.  Most REAL people are moderates. Life is just not that black and white.Did anyone see the advertisement right before this video played BASHING BERNIE? These guys are crafty and swift with the slander adverts!WOW....I WAS TRUMP 2016<br />I WAS GOING TO BE TRUMP 2020<br />BUT I JUST CHANGE MY MIND...BERNIE 2020!!!!!It would be very informative to see Bernie Sanders, Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson, Tulsi Gabbard and Elizabeth Warren get together for a conversation.At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h01m00s">1:01:00</a>, I can&#39;t help but recognize that he is talking to Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar (my current home) and the AUE, and saying specifically that they need to decrease their national GDP (based on oil) growth. That they need to let millions (not hyperbole) die in order to let fossil fuels decline. American&#39;s won&#39;t be harmed, fracking has been amazing for the net output of the U.S,; but not so for Europe, and especially for South East Asia, where what he is proposing is as death sentence for &gt;100M people. May I propose a humble alternative:<br /><br />We neutralize taxes for companies that are developing energy efficient systems. That is, we remove taxes on the R&amp;D work of these new systems. At the same time, we create a national enterprise (think NASA), that helps promote and fund ventures that the Private Sector thinks are promising, and that we incentivize cooperation through this GOV entity . THAT IS TO SAY: we encourage companies to come together under a government regulated umbrella for the purpose of patents and copywrite, and then SELL that technology at the national level to developing counties.<br /><br />Anyone who has examined the toxic outputs of China and India KNOWS that these are the two greatest outputs of harmful gasses during our lifetime. If we, the U.S. are able to sell them the solution (or have this at that hand at the international table), then not only wlll the U.S profit, but so will humanity in the long run! Our own CO2 levels are falling while theirs are rising. Surely there in a market solution that can effect and restrain both systems...Solid interview. Bernie is great.Joe we need more of these.  Ask Trump on twitter please.  Have had a few people just these week talking about the woman they liked from the debates even my dad said something . Told every one of them to check her out on Joe Rogan.  i feel like I know so much more about these people after one of these than I do after a debate.Sanders/Gabbard in 2020!What?! You are awesome joe! The diversity of your guests is astounding! Keep it upOr, watch an interview where questions were actually answered!: <a href="https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8">https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=46m33s">46:33</a> The US has more people in jail, than China. lmaoIn bernies UTOPIA we&#39;d all be invading china to stop global warming.... trhink about that folks.Bernie and Alex Jones have more in common than you think. They&#39;re genius. The real devil are industrial Democrats, Bernie is the only hope the real Democratic party has.Lol another 2 hours of Bernie not actually being questioned on his nonsense.  Hopefully Joe does his job. <br /><br />Hey Bernie... The politicians are the one&#39;s doing the debates in sound bites on garbage.<br /><br />Its funny when it&#39;s something bad.   It&#39;s the nation, it&#39;s the media,  it&#39;s the format.   <br /><br />When it&#39;s good.  It&#39;s the politicians. LolWe have lobbyists because we have government involvement. In every aspect of country we see prices skyrocket once the government gets involved and starts making decisions, and picking favorites. Hence the lobbyists give massive amounts of money to politicians to craft legislation in their favor. When the government started handing out pel grants for college you saw the price of college skyrocket. When the govt  tells apartment owners what they can or can’t charge then you see prices skyrocket or they take the apartment of the market like in the sf Bay Area where we have a massive homeless problem, skyrocketing rents and over 100,000 empty units. When the govt stays out of an industry you see competition and prices plummet. The government is the absolute worst way to try and help people. Tell me one governmt program that isn’t insanely expensive and inefficient.Not 3 hours?Also, its not climate change is hoax.  Most of the reasonable people against this issue believe on IPCC findings, what they are not agreeing on is computer modeled prediction, and how much money you spend to how much impact it has on stopping the climate change. Just look at the economic impact to climate temperature projection. I am just sick and tired of the strawman about &quot;climate change denier&quot; we are not having the discussion we need to be having.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>40 billion over 20 years is nothingWhy so many dislikes?How deeply disappointing.  I&#39;&#39;m progressive, but Bernie is deceiving us into believing that he could actually get anything done if elected.  The big money is in American politics for many reasons -- Citizens United, for one -- and Bernie has no plan to change this.  Game over.From 55 to 45 to 35 and expand it to hearing aids, etc over 4 years...that doesn&#39;t sound too radical, does it?...sounds pretty radical. It&#39;d benefit me, I&#39;d be thankful, but its the HOW I&#39;m concerned about.It’s fun to watch JRE go through huge milestones like this. Better not hand him a blunt, Joe.What has he accomplished as a life long politician? Apart from profiting off the system he claims to hate.Medicare does not pay for my insulin pump supplies. I&#39;d rather have that than glasses.You should get Beto O’Rourke in next time.Thanks Joe, I appreciate you circling back to lobbyists and the money influence issue when it may have slipped by the first time, this was a measured and balanced interview the actual left, not the centrist corporate Democrats, never get in America.ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I like the bark on bernieWhat is he talking about when he says Assault weapons? Automatic weapons are illegal. All these mass shootings are done by people with semi-automatic weapons. Semi-automatic simply meaning one shot per pull of the trigger.  Most gun violence is done with semi-automatic hand guns anyways.If we can combine Trumps job creation with Bernies ideas we&#39;d have a better country..I voted Trump but I agree with everything Bernie is sayingWTF....why this did not pop up when it was live? ......and nothing in mine sub tab ....its 2016 all over againDo white people still not know what its like to be poor?listening to bernie sanders nostrils for an hour while he sugar coats taxes I CANT WAITA humanizing look at our next president. 💙Where Alex Jones @👀Watched all but never subbed. Now I subbedDonde esta la biblioteca☝🏼BERNIE!!!!!!!!Fuck Bernie edit... 8 thousandth dislike 🖕I have seen better from Joe.Please , someone tell me if Joe ever asks hard questions of Bernie...or is it a softball interview?I talked to this guy, never forget itGod I listen to him and pray he doesn’t ever end up in the White HouseBUT DID YOU ASK ABOUT DMT!?Joe!! Please invite The Donald 😁This is your worst guest yet and you regularly have cunts that believe they have seen aliens.Everyone else around the world thinks Bernie has been the only sane politician in America for years. Hopefully with Joes help the American people can see sense finally.“Possibly next president of US”<br />Joe rogan is a true legend <br />This is epic !!<br />Would like to see  Steve BullockThis Bernie Sanders podcast episode needs Alex Jones.<b><i>HEALTHCARE IS A PRIVILEGE, NOT A RIGHT</i></b>Good podcastBERNIE IS A MILLIONAIRE WITH 3 VACATION HOMES. <br />His healthcare for all is gonna be healthcare for none. He says it costs 40T, Harris says 30T but high projections are 80T. Keep in mind the ENTIRE BUDGET for police and schools and military and roads and EVERYTHING is 4T a year. Youre saying were just gonna not have all those only for healthcare? We would be paying for his mess long after he was president if he won.Joe it&#39;s legal because they make the laws. Russia&#39;s gun laws states they need a doctor&#39;s permission.1st choiceWe need to lower the cost of living before we raise minimum wage.America, here is your opportunity to be in the right side of history for once. Vote Bernie Sanders 2020. Period.Climate change is real ??? They&#39;ve been saying this for over 50 yrs , oceans are not rising <del>AT ALL</del> ...&quot;Who&#39;s Joe Rogan?&quot; - Biden<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m54s">5:54</a> “ you can go to any dr you want” sorry Bernie but you can’tThis is sadIt’s been incredible watching this podcast grow. Amazing interviewer in an amazing studio. Great job Joe!&quot;leader of the cuck.. vroom vroom&quot; just kidding. if bernie wins dem nom im in.. if he doesnt turn independent after losing dem nom though then fk politics for life... cause he woulda won as an independent at last min in 2016 and he has the same ability in 2020.Bernie goes on and on about Climate Change but he doesn&#39;t understand the basic facts. First there is a consensus the planet is warming however then there are two debates, firstly is it a natural cycle that will reverse and secondly is it induced by man. There is about a 2/3 consensus man is having some impact but the level of effect varies. However there is almost no consensus of the Left&#39;s propaganda of a &quot;climate crisis&quot; with a 12 year ticking clock.<br /><br /><br />Either Bernie is stupid or he is deceiving people by conflating different ideas such as climate change implies man made climate change so if Scientist agree on the former but not the latter then Bernie conflates the two. Then Bernie takes it a step further and states the climate crisis theory is climate change. So where as 100% might agree with the former but only 0.2% with the latter Bernie basically lies that the former believe in the latter through the conflation.Mass shootings?  Yeah  I can imagine that in Stalins Russia, Natzi germany, WW1 WW2 - people went and killed each other becuase GOVERNMENTS told them too.  How about not expanding the role of government and let people be free to defend themselves?Notice when Bernie is unsure of an answer he actually admits it, like an adult.  Refreshing....LMAO!!!Bernie, how about you put your life where your mouth is and lead by example. You&#39;re an old man, you&#39;ve got to have health issues affecting you right now, if not, they&#39;re coming. How about you set an example and get all your treatment done in Canada, and WAIT IN LINE FOR IT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. When you recover and live, come back and tell us how it went.... We&#39;ll be waiting.Holy f**k! I clicked like before I even watch this because I&#39;d never think Bernie would ever come on JRE podcastFuuuuck that guy 😂😂I understand being &quot;polite&quot; but jeezus come on joe....get in there!<b>Who is America?</b>Oh no, people are going to think Joe votes for the leftYang 20/20Holy shit. It actually happenedFor some reason I didn&#39;t get the push notification for this :( Bernie is amazingFUCK DEMOCRATS. FUCK SOCIALISM.  WE WILL NEVER ALLOW IT. YOU DISGUSTING INDIVIDUALS THAT SUPPORT SOCIALISM CAN MOVE TO VENEZUELA.Joe your follow-up questions are non-existent.... Just roll over dude.Not true about the gun issue. You cannot walk into a gun show and buy anything without background check. Criminals do not care about laws.Love this show. I just wish he knew how to push Bernie on all this nonsense. He is getting no pushback.Hmm, some of this I totally am down with, others not so much. One thing that struck me was this discussion about depression in rural areas and  how universal health care etc. would help to fix that. Well, Japan has universal health care and a high rate of employment and high paying jobs ... it also has an extraordinarily high suicide rate. <br /><br />They&#39;re on the right road though ... many of our issues is in the United States comes from a lack of empathy, purpose, and morality ... yet at the same time we&#39;re throwing all that away and wondering why things are in the toilet. It&#39;s a cultural issue. Politics and the government can only put a band aid on it, the true solution comes from humanity fixing itself.Oh look another sell out that will call anyone a racist just to appease the dems. Hypocritical assholeBernie 2020!!!America needs an overall attitude adjustment from top to bottom. The problem with any of these issues that were discussed is the corporate control and power companies or wealthy individuals can impose on the systems. How do you convince people, who have nothing to worry about and can dictate the rules at any given turn, that there&#39;s something terrible happening around them?Joe Rogan filled the void left by Charlie RoseWow👏👏👏👏👏Another incompetent Rogan interview. Never asked comrade Sanders about his belief that White people don&#39;t know what its like to be poor.Another incompetent Rogan interview. Never asked comrade Sanders about his belief that White people don&#39;t know what its like to be poor.I&#39;ve gotta say I really think Joe took what David said to heart. It&#39;s fine that Joe would talk to Alex Jones and Ben Shapiro but for a long time there it was really getting one sided glad to see Joe opening up to move leftistsYou could tell the only question joe REALLY wanted to ask was the last onethe rich are purging the poor.it should be mandatory for all candidates to be on the JRE podcast!Ironically, this interview suffered a bit from the exact issue it criticized mainstream media for... too many sound bites, and not going deep enough into the issues. I would have loved a 3 hour interview with more conversational flow, and less &quot;Joe asks, Bernie answers&quot; sort of format. Still, props to Joe for making this conversation happen. And props to Bernie for being real enough to come on a platform like this.Bernie was stupid to compare climate change to the Nazis....  The former is infinitely more dangerous and it&#39;s propaganda strategy would make Joseph Goebbels weep with jealousyIf climate change is real why the fuck is it so cold up here in Canada?What a clownhaha I can&#39;t unsee this after seeing it, but imagine someone else is sitting in for Bernie and someone superimposed bernies animated head over that person, just too low avoiding any neck exposure.I cannot fucking believe my eyes, Bernie Sanders on JRE.I would still like Bernie if he hadn&#39;t bent the knee to SJWsLammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeHe should host debates.... In form of fear factor. Imagine Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren having to be locked up in a cage of mice while they explain their healthcare plans.Look, Folks, never trust a host of a talk show with more makeup than common sense!Andrew yang 2020Bernie should just say he would elect Gabbard as Vice President if he wins and convince Gabbard to sit out but instead, send her supporters his way. Listen, Bernie/Gabbard or Garbbard/Bernie is gonna rock the World.Just stopped in to say Bernie is fucking insane lol. I can&#39;t even listen to him talk anymore.Says I know what I&#39;m talking about and then says I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talkin about😂😂😂This guy is still getting support?Could you imagine Trump going on JRE?Fucking capitalist pig 🐽&quot;Canna dates&quot; who TF talks like that. That&#39;s a no from me budKinda freaked out that this interview made me realize that lobbying groups can LEGALLY offer Joe Rogan tens of millions of dollars to get candidates of their choice on his show to give softball questions and Joe wouldn&#39;t be obligated to tell anyone.I was excited...  but very soft questions without really challenging him on any policies.   If this were an alien guy or mma expert he would have challenged him much more.He’s such a loser, Joe is such a lefty.This was flame i hope it convinces more people bernies the real deal and should lead this  country into a greater USA  for the next 8 yearsWasn’t it just the other week that we saw Bernie was not paying his own staff a $15 min wage?I agree with Bernie. The DNC and MSM is a joke.Wish this was longer, great showThere&#39;s a killer on the road<br />His brain is squirmin like a toad<br />Take a long holiday <br /><br />Let your children play<br />If you give this man a ride <br /><br />Sweet family will die<br />Killer on the road<br />Don&#39;t trust politicians <br /><br />The inbred elite<br />They got there coz they cheatI came here a Trump fan but I...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Left here a Trump fan.Bernie just cemented my vote by promising them aliensJoe should just change the name of the podcast to &quot;Softball Interviews for Democrats&quot;.  Bernie the hypocrite wasn&#39;t even paying his own campaign staff $15/hr and as soon as it became public, he agreed to give them a raise to $15/hr, but reduced their hours worked.  Joe just let Bernie lie right to his face without any push back, this will be the worst JRE since the first Jack Dorsey.When Bernie mention DMC I thought for a sec (hoping) he said DMT. 🤡🎉awesome to see Bernie on JRE * guests can actually go in-depth. Bernie&#39;s right about M4A elsewhere - he needs to point out more often to countries such as OZ, CA, UK, IT, FR that have working &amp; effective M4A - countries that also have Defense expenditures (stops the likes of Ben Shapiro &amp; his ilk as they only mention countries with M4A that don&#39;t have military budgets).2.4 trillion in debt canceled  would be like adding 2.4 trillion of spending to the economy.If Bernie would turn it down 25% and NOT pass new gun control legislation I would vote for himBernie totally lied about the knowledge of space aliens, he&#39;s not getting my vote now.not one word about immigration!Canadians like to come to the US for the better procedures, surgeries, and medicine prescriptions. But Bernie won’t mention that. UVM is a prime example.Yang Gang!!joe is letting this communist slide so easily. university of california where? why didnt you ask him that joe? california is a big fucking state u bich ass nigga<b>The discrepancy within the dysfunctional Democrat party is so painfully stark.</b> Agree or disagree with Bernie, he is 1000x more lucid, articulate, and altogether more functional than Joe Biden. No matter how you cut this bread, Folks... lemme tell ya, Folks, this here moldy Joe is clearly suffering diminished mental capacity due to old age, and possibly symptoms of dementia or other musty afflictions. 🙄 I am not a Bernie guy (or a Democrat party adherent, for that matter...) but clearly he is not the raving, babbling circus buffoon the opposition media resentfully portrays him to be (and probably necessarily so, as the aim in the current system is to win elections and crush &amp; smear your competitor-- even if that primary competition comes from within one&#39;s own party...).<br /><br />I think the contrast between Bernie&#39;s intellect and Joe Biden&#39;s shallow, confused &quot;Look, folks... lemme tell ya...&quot; followed by some broken, mispoken foolish misremembered-incorrectly-memorized talking point is downright scary.... It may well be scary because, if you disagree with Bernie, then naturally you want nothing to do with this person being president, as he certainly would work towards the agenda he consistently profiles on campaign. Could be! But if the Democrat party was actually serious about making institutional changes, and introducing meaningful, substantive changes to America-- as opposed to simply reshuffling the same old three-card Monty corporation nonsense-- then they would get behind Bernie while he&#39;s still not-quite-9000-years old. Instead, they prop up a doddering, embarrassing senile fool with a folksy smile, and an unbelievable tendency for the most absurd gaffes... coupled with a light-skinned black &quot;Hillary 2.0&quot; career opportunist whose only genuine personal conviction is to absolutely double-down on whatever position her well-paid marketing team &quot;focus group&quot; tells her to support-- whether or not that position changes, often literally within a day or two... and whether or not she is rightfully perceived to be a serial waffler.<br /><br />Perhaps it&#39;s for the best. 🙄 The Democrat party is presently a horror show, currently saturated in the destructive ideological currencies of &quot;social justice&quot; (mob justice rooted in bigoted bullying), identity politics (contentious bigoted tribalism, anathema to unity and a United America), and intersectional victimhood (the value of one&#39;s societal worth being hierarchically determined by one&#39;s tribal group-experience of being &quot;victimized&quot;). These are literally the foundations of a neo-Stalinist, truly authoritarian police state. It is... frightening, in a sober, grave sense.<br /><br />---<br />Sidebar... here we go.... 🙄 Bernie is just plain wrong about all of his typically misinformed, ignorant, hysterical positions on &quot;the problem&quot; of firearms in America. No, Bernie, you can&#39;t just &quot;walk into a gun show&quot; and buy a gun without a background check, and no, it certainly is not legal to &quot;buy a dozen weapons, and then legally sell them to anyone you want.&quot; This is just pure, ridiculous nonsense. There are plenty of stringent laws against &quot;straw purchasing,&quot; among the 10,000 firearms laws nationwide. Notwithstanding, the real truth about which Bernie speaks is absolutely contrary to the ignorance and misperception of American gun culture: the sheer number of firearm owners and &quot;assault weapons&quot; in the United States speaks to the amazing responsibility and safety record of American gun owners. 100 Million firearm owners in a nation of 330 Million people, collectively owning 400+ Million guns, including at least 20 Million &quot;military-patterned&quot; long guns (i.e., probably far more... Bernie cites 5-6 Million, but true data reveals the number to be much higher than that, regardless the definitions used). All this, juggling huge numbers in the tens of millions, and still the actual instances of Americans killed annually by ALL long guns together, including ALL rifles and shotguns, is roughly 400-500 people (including justified homicides and police shootings)... again, in a nation of 330 Million people, with 400+ Million guns. America has 250+ Million handguns, and these are by far and away more commonly involved in shootings, used in roughly 5-6 thousand annual deaths. Of the 400-500 long gun deaths, &quot;assault weapons&quot; are usually involved in about 100-150 annual deaths (which again includes all justified homicides and police shootings, along with mass murders...). The whole alarmist, hysterical silliness concerning &quot;assault weapons&quot; is just that: silly and unfounded panic, an emotional overreaction to an admittedly ugly, horrific, but exceptionally rare type of tragedy that is being shamelessly exploited to advance a draconian vision of civilian disarmament against perfectly capable, perfectly safe and free Americans. In contrast, literally hundreds of thousands of people perish each year due to medical errors of malpractice... and who is freaking out daily about this &quot;out of control epidemic.&quot; 🙄 Nobody is &quot;banning&quot; doctors... in fact, it seems Bernie would like to mandate them-- a doctor in every household... despite doctors being responsible, directly or indirectly, for literally 500x (Five Hundred Times!) the deaths annually of all the Americans unfortunately killed by all long guns in whatever circumstances, mass shooting or otherwise. The whole &quot;situation&quot; involving guns in the United States is an unfortunate, sad example of intellectual laziness and emotional hyperbole. This is textbook exploitative hysteria, and frankly, Joe should know not to gobble up the hype and hyperbole... perhaps he does. Yes... it is terribly sad that people die and are murdered in mass killings... only, it just has literally nothing whatsoever to do with 99.99999% of American firearms owners (i.e., it looks like an invented, randomly exaggerated numeral, &quot;99.99999,&quot; yet it is in fact at least that much)... and in the grand scheme of things, especially statistically, these events are an exceptionally rare and aberrant phenomenon, making a relatively low-priority issue compared to almost any other problem in America. It&#39;s graphic, gruesome, and easily exploited... that is why it is an emotionally wrenching big deal. Medical malpractice isn&#39;t quite as &quot;sexy&quot; for the irresponsible, agenda-driven mass media. Nobody is saying the issue of mass murders shouldn&#39;t be addressed... it&#39;s just that millions of Americans think that &quot;guns&quot; and &quot;assault weapons&quot; have little or nothing to do with it, and justifiably so. We are just urging: maintain perspective, for all the gravity is lost when the subject degrades into ignorant, prejudiced, alarmist hysteria.<br /><br />Lastly... as Joe wraps it up here, and I can stop yapping while I listen...in the U.S., roughly 900-1000 people are beaten to death with hands and fists annually. Joe cites the hyperbolic, irresponsibly inflated &quot;mass shooting&quot; index (i.e., &quot;hundreds of mass shootings this year...&quot;) which is just plain wrong. And irresponsible. The Washington Post, a leading crusader for draconian gun control, concedes that there have been 1196 murders due to mass shooting since 1966. In other words, slightly more people have been killed by actual mass shootings than are killed every year in America by hands and feet (i.e., actual mass shootings-- not merely inflated, exploitative &quot;padded stats&quot; based on the stupidly contextless definition of &quot;four people plus gun equals mass shooting&quot;). What would Joe say... were the martial arts, jiu-jitsu, and MMA all relentlessly smeared, attacked, stigmatized and driven into draconian regulation by ignorant and prejudiced hysteria... and then banned outright, practicing these deadly exercises sanctioned by law...? To save those thousand souls who are savagely beat to death every year? Oh... but &quot;guns!&quot; 40,000! &quot;Unprecendented in the civilized world!&quot; ...or is it? The truth is not as exciting. Such hyperbolic numbers are for the lazy, for the inattentive, and for the gullible. The bare truth is, all these statistics are painstakingly pored over year by year, day by day, and this awful truth reveals that... really, &quot;gun violence&quot; is a hyped mythology blown far out of proportion, particularly in light of the number of its collective practitioners and American gun owners and their amazingly huge collection of weapons. And further regulations on this &quot;type of weapon&quot; or that, based on some ignorant and arbitrary prejudice of guns, simply won&#39;t change what we know by fact: that by far and away, most gun deaths are suicides, the remaining bulk are urban crimes in already gun-controlled areas using handguns, and then police shootings and justified homicides round out the rest... with the smallest number being mass murders and other crimes, smaller even than &quot;accidents&quot; (i.e., deaths by negligent discharges, which number roughly 400-500 souls annually...). As terrible as these evil mass killings may be... the phenomenon just isn&#39;t as big a problem as so many other things that kill at least as many or more people, yearly. Twice as many people are killed by bicycles, for instance. 😳 But... the truth, while freely available from raw, primary sources (like the FBI and CDC... not Mother Jones, or The <a href="http://trace.org/">Trace.org</a> or Moms Demand Hysteria... for god&#39;s sake)... the truth simply isn&#39;t available for the lazy or preoccupied. If you&#39;ve gotten this far through a mere YouTube comment, then perhaps you are one of Joe&#39;s listeners who have the critical thinking skills to see beyond this ignorance about &quot;gun violence,&quot; and the nutty, prejudiced hysteria that fuels the exploitation of mass murder in pursuit of a zealous crusade.<br /><br />Good show... revealing and interesting, as usual. Cheers.I dig what he saying.. yet what are we gonna be about the money being backed by nothing?Holy shit what a fucking POWER moveGet Yang back onThe DNC is in a tough position is that why they f*<b>**</b> you seems to me they put you in a tough position Bernie when they pull down your pants and f*** you in your ass you f*<b>***</b> loser how can you defend this I mean I know why you&#39;re a dirty f*<b>***</b> communist moron but I still don&#39;t understand I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re a man at a certain point your balls f*<b>***</b> turn on and say no f*** this s*** maybe you don&#39;t have yours anymore maybe you&#39;re super into that f*<b>***</b> T part of the lgbtSupported Bernie in 2016 and will do the same in 2020. He is hands down the best candidate and to those who say he is too old to be president - I WOULD VOTE FOR HIS DEAD CORPSE OVER ANY OTHER CANDIDATE because at least he would appoint a sensible cabinet that&#39;s not controlled by the billionaire class and restore democracy!Wow how much money did ole Burn pay Joe for the hour plus of constant fellatio?Bernie Sanders should make his campaign slogan &quot;Let&#39;s ACTUALLY make America great this time.&quot;WoW!!!!!! Most awesomest podcast ever and ever!what the fuuuuuuuck?!JRE has a lefty as a guest? The sky must be falling.Whoa whoa whoa, I Know a few canadians that dont know each other. None of them like the Canadian healthcare. Like at all. At the end of the day hes wrong about that one. Sorry. But I&#39;ll keep listening on. Love my daily dose of JREThe rest of the world&#39;s leaders would walk all over him. They have a different view on life. It&#39;s not that people think climate change is real, it&#39;s that it&#39;s a natural happening,  not made worse by man. Here we go again. PIVOT.Bernie and Tulsi 2020His own staff demanded 15 an hour and he cut thier hours to do it. Free college education will just increase unskilled workers in important positions (doctors, nurses, police, etc) , boost entitlement which is already a problem, increase unemployment if businesses have to pay 15 an hour or more, this guy will just stop our progress we have made in our economy under Trump. Hell we saw what happened when his buddy AOC killed the Amazon deal in NYC, if he had any power we would lose almost all of our big tech or manufacturing jobs. If your in your 30s and work at a fast food restaurant you need to do better and work your way up. Sick of this guy. Cant wait until he stops running. At least he doesnt kiss or grope little girls but damn.. The left is so far from reality hopefully we will see a Trump family dynasty.bernie and bust on some big ass titties!the perfect place to hear a candidate speak his mind, Joe will let them speak and ask normal questions iam not a Bernie fan what so ever but iam really interested to hear him speak, this should be goodWhat a commieI can’t even describe the excitement that came fourth when I saw this was posted!!! I almost could not believe it. Thank you so much Joe!!! Great questions for Bernie and great answers from my man Bernie.  ❤️❤️❤️ Can we just have Bernie/Yang for 2020?! Or maybe Bernie/Tulsi 😊Great to see many different perspectives on this show. No need for the dislikes. :)Mental  illness is not the problem these people were brought up with certain ideology believing in some thing like God is not mentally ill is it?i want a 15% tax across the board. thats it. everyone pays 15%.Comments: <br />80% : “Bernie ain’t that bad”<br /> <br />15% : UFO <br /><br />5% : ‘redditors and conservatives spewing insults/trolling’Holy shit dude.When someone opens with &quot; to answer your question&quot;, you know they are going to not answer the questionThis has gotta be a joke Hahahahahahagood shit 👍Demoquatic Socialism.If you can get Warren, Sanders, Yang, Gabbard, and Williamson on for a 4 hour round table discussion, I will donate $1,000 to the show.Can’t say I’m a sanders fan but still very  interestingCool story bro, you already blew your load in last campaignWhy is this podcast only 1 hour long??<br /><br />And why does this feel like an interview and less like a fun, JRE podcast?Free college so you can get the $15/hr job at mcDsLITERALLY, 3 minutes in and Bernie is already complaining about how we should do what other countries do and whining about &quot;free airtime&quot;.<br />SMH. Fuck this guy. He rolled over after the DNC fucked him and he is a millionaire socialist: a walking, talking oxymoron.What rubs me wrong is how much of a yes man bernie is.. not all these things are obtainable, there is give and take on every issue.  Nor should all these things be done. Just makes me feel like he’s lying to my face with his sweet wordsAmazing conversation. I grew up conservative and many of my beliefs are still conservative, but this man has won my vote and my support. I was always a fan of Bernie&#39;s stance on free speech, but I never could&#39;ve imagined I would support his views this much. Long-form content is definitely the way to go with current affairs the way they are.  Substance &gt; SpectacleI’m gonna admit up front that my following statement may be naive but reading comments I hear that upping the minimum wage will raise the cost of living and decreasing it would lower the cost. Am I wrong in thinking that either way you will end up spending similar percentages of your income? So what difference does it make what the minimum wage is in that regard?Bernie is my president this man is a hero2 amazing human beings right here, thanks Joe and thank you Bernie for the great dialog.The CBO issued a report stating a 15$ an hr minimum wage would eliminate 1.3 million jobs. Medicare for all will cost trillions of dollars a year. Free tuition will cost multi billions of dollars a year. You really think taxing the top 1% of people will accomplish all of this haha? I like Bernie and I think he means well, but the truth of it is he is promising things he can’t deliver on. He pumps up the Scandinavian countries as examples but fails to tell you they have been living under the blanket of security we have provided them for the last 70 years. They have almost no defense budget whatsoever. He talks a good game but the only way you can implement these programs is a massive government takeover of the American economy. The middle class would be decimated under Bernie’s leadership.This is great. Thank you Joe Rogan.You should ask him about his trips to the Soviet Union. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2d3DMC6qyg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2d3DMC6qyg</a>if better care is your motivation for health care reform in the image of european or commonwealth countries and you want to avoid a system where profit comes before quality of care you&#39;ll find no one from these countries  confirming this. in my mind if the discussion was sincere you&#39;d need to be way more specific or the bottom line will just be people getting ripped off in a different manner.I am going to lose my mind if Bernie comes back on the show in a few years and spills all that alien gossipOur Canadian health care is not perfect, but it&#39;s very reliable. You break a leg? You go get it fixed and only have to pay for the crutches. Heart attack? Yep, you&#39;re good. Now mind you, we pay taxes upon taxes. And yes we have to pay for prescription drugs, but it may only be $50-$100 and most employers have a health insurance policy for their employees to cover 50-80% of the cost. But we NEVER have to worry about a doctor&#39;s bill. Again, it&#39;s not perfect. But it really is achievable.How many went straight to the comments, before a voice heard?The healthcare in Canada is pretty bad. It takes ages just to make an appointment with your family doctor.Every weapon knife stick or gun is a fucking assault weaponIt fuckin happened!!!As a Canadian, I&#39;d be proud to vote for Bernie if I could.We had this many guns before we had this huge culture change... maybe we should change the culture back...Canadian healthcare is not free.Why would you bring on this socialist small hat piece of trash who sucks at politics&quot;No, they wouldn&#39;t agree to it, we&#39;d have to pass legislation.&quot; Brilliant. As if the government isn&#39;t involved in what the news puts out enough already.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=53m38s">53:38</a> Sounds a lot like Donald Trump In 2016. What a fucking crock of shit this all is. Joe nearly redeemed himself after blowing Jack Dorsey. Then he brings this asshole on and kissed his balls for an hour.<br /><br />Done with JRE. Self serving horseshit. Now he uses his platform to push his candidate of choice.<br /><br />Suck it, Joe. You left wing dipshit.Bernie is really playing up the &quot;I love poor whites&quot; line for the Joe Rogan audience!I&#39;m done , this guy is the true conspiracy theoristIs he going to answer any question directly?I LOVE how Berne&#39;s Ideas were considered &quot;Fringe&quot; a few years ago, but polling shows the VAST majority of Americans want exactly what he&#39;s been pushing for, for years.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FeelTheBern">#FeelTheBern</a>I appreciate that online media channels like this are willing to show interviews with people from various ranges of the political spectrum.  More interviews like this should be done to show ideas of all perspectives.Bernie is a gun grabber. SAD!I got an ad against medicare for all in the middle of this podcastJoe just had to ask the alien question he couldn’t help himself😂 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23savage">#savage</a>Bernie isn&#39;t very Christian like...Unreal manJoe, we proud of you!Ther Berns got some good points but I think Maynard had a better solution to it all!BERNIE 2020!!!!!!!Hey Joe, I just want to say that you might have just won Bernie the 2020 presidential election. This guy is speaking the truth and not trying to hide anything from anybody I stand by somebody who is honesty and doesn’t try to manipulate the system. I really appreciate this podcast, if Bernie is elected I will be one of the millions beside him for the real change in America!The last question was what I was really waiting for.I&#39;m gonna listen to this shit tomorrow one more time. Just so I&#39;m sure, but it seems this is a terrible interview of a presidential candidate with no push back. In fact I would call this interview. Terrible, worse than the Twitter CEO interview with Jack. There&#39;s a bunch of bias hereThanks for interviewing him, but I have to say it. Socialism kills.JRE is the most important podcast/show on YouTube or tv.bernie is still sharp as a tackI just wanted him to start talking about DMT and sex robots and freak out BernieWho is dumber? Bernie Sanders or Joe Rogan!?  Hmmmmm.....If we can censor so called &quot;nazis&quot; like Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Laura Loomer, surely we can silence filthy Communists. Commies have killed tens of millions of people, making the Nazis look like the JV oppressors.This is a Great convoCan we talk about how 2 seconds I realized I confused Bernie Sanders with Warren Buffet?BooooooooooooooooooooooooooRaising the minimum wage is like putting a band-aid on a gapping wound. The problem is inflation. Government borrowing and spending is out of control and has been for many many decades. If the minimum wage was raised to 30 bucks an hour tomorrow it would take about 20 years before that was no longer a &quot;living wage&quot;. We need a balanced budget amendment added to the constitution and we need to stop welfare to corporations and foreign countries.<br /><br />I agree that drug companies should be forced through legislation to lower their prices to a level that matches the world wide average. Same for Doctors and Hospitals.<br /><br />The cost of education has continued to rise while the quality has dropped. Liberal arts degrees should be paid for by students. Grants should be expanded for engineering, sciences, &amp; trade schools.<br /><br />Welfare should be eliminated and replaced with workfare for all but the truely disabled and infirmed.<br /><br />All drugs should be decriminalized. <br /><br />Open carry of legally owned weapons should legal everywhere all the time.<br /><br />Immigration (legal &amp; illegal) should be stopped completely for no less than 10 years. Illegals should be rounded up and sent home. If Dems think they can round up millions of guns from millions of people then surely we can round up millions if illegal aliens.<br /><br />Corporal punishment should be reinstated in schools. So should saying the pledge of allegiance.<br /><br />It should be illegal to put hormones in our food and chemicals in our water.Got a hold his feet closer to the fire though I get the respect aspect but question Bernie , question him why he let the dnc step all over himI wonder if Bernie understands what freedom means . Maniacs do not and will not dictate terms on the second amendment to a free people . You want them Bernie ? Come get them your damn self .Normally a fan of the channel. God Joe could you have been any softer on him . I get you needed to give him time for his platform, but when he misspoke about the &quot;assault rifles&quot; and you as a gun owner/shooter failed to call him out , just bad. You needed imo to call him on the bs from the guns,  To the inner city issues caused by decades of democratic failures.  The man has been part of all these problems for decades. He has not done a damn thing that is realisticExcellent interview. Sanders talks about issues that affect all of us and would actually do something about it. I know who I&#39;m supporting for president. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieSanders2020">#BernieSanders2020</a>Okay, the MSM is DOA baby, Joe Rogan is the future of media, thank god!I wonder if he asked Bernie if he’s tried DMT.Fucking communist.Can&#39;t afford college? Fuck you. Get a scholarship or enlist into the military for four years. Serve your nation for four short years instead of contributing to the cost inflation of a college degree.Bernie Sanders = Old Man Logan irl. He’s earned my vote by actually fighting for the 99% like a consistent Adamantium champ for his entire life, and like a true badass mutant underdog, being no stranger to adversity, labor, and of course, sacrifice.<br /><br />No matter who’s tried to buy him off or what the establishment’s tried to dangle in front of him over his 40+ years of public service, Bernie’s always been an incorruptible rock.<br /><br />No one puts more fear into the hearts of our corrupt establishment elites, mainstream corporate media, or corrupt self-serving politicians, than a working man’s anti-hero like Bernie Sanders. Shush, there I go rambling again.<br /><br />Much love from down here in Texas to brother Sanders, of course brother Rogan, and to all y’all just wanting the very best for y’alls families... cuz there ain’t nothin’ at all wrong with that! ✌️🤠🇺🇸Bernie &quot;all that I&#39;m sayin...&quot; Sanders.  God bless this is wonderful.  Thanks Joethis&#39;ll hit a mill in no time.Can&#39;t wait to vote for this man. His Medicare for all bill is actually better than what Canada is doing&quot;They&quot; guarantee health care to &quot;their&quot; people.  Mate we are all free to fuckup or look after &quot;Our&quot; own health.  Dude get a grip.There should be a YouTube debate between Ben Shapiro and Bernie SandersAOC wants open borders, i still don&#39;t know how this helps us. Fill America with third world people and we become a third world countrycomment for Algorithm to push up the bernWell that went nowhere.Is the wall  being built to keep Americans in , so they cant buy the cheap pharmaceutical drugs in Mexico.The second amendment exists because we live in a dark and evil world. I&#39;m never gonna let Bernie take my guns, I&#39;ve done absolutely nothing wrong, why should I lose my guns? Are we gonna ban trucks and fertilizer too? Remember when someone killed 80+ people with a truck in France? Or when someone built a giant fertilizer and set it off in oklahoma city and killed 168 people? Guns aren&#39;t the issue. A car can do just as much damage if not more than a gun, and far more easily.Love Joe having politicians on for discussions - but definitely did not change my mind on Bernie after listening to him for an hourSocialists talking about economy is really funny. They always talk about the same shit without having no explanation or real plan. Just crazy ideas and crazy numbersIf it&#39;s so goddamn demeaning then why aren&#39;t all of your f*<b>***</b> candidates on Joe Rogan show guarantee you he&#39;d have each one of you on no problem. To be quite honest so I watch those debates and quite honestly I didn&#39;t see anything to meaning other than what you were doing to yourselves. You people are truly the most pathetic losers I&#39;ve ever seen in my life and I know some f*<b>***</b> losers I would rather vote for a dude on PCP actively stabbing someone as long as he said you guys were f*<b>***</b> idiots again truly patheticIm on the right but I&#39;ll check this out I&#39;ll try hard to not go aha or yell bs I&#39;ll and see what it looks like on the othersideWOW! Bernie!🤗🤗🤗🔥🔥🔥<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=43m55s">43:55</a>   Ilhan Omar must have called him up.Initial response: Yay! Bernie on Joe&#39;s podcast!<br />2nd response: Only an hour?! How can anyone have a meaningful conversation in an hour? lolI woulda thought one of the other candidates would have paid him not to appear and he woulda taken the money a ran, like he did when the clinton campaign paid him to let her be the candidate.I was waiting for one of his epic outbursts lmaoJRE is this generation&#39;s Larry KingPER CAPITA!For everyone out there that feels hopeless and helpless to what to do to help stop these senseless mass murders, here is my plan:<br /><br />Every gun buyer has to submit to the following mandatory measures before they can complete a gun purchase:<br />1. A current psychological evaluation.<br />2. An interview of friends and family members.<br />3. A state and federal criminal record background investigation.<br />4. A social media evaluation. <br />I believe this would be a great start to finding the mentally disturbed out there. I know this is controversial, but something needs to be done. Any positive comments are welcome. Doing nothing is not an option!The Powerful Bern RE!!!!Also.. almost finished and Bernie hasn&#39;t called Trump a white supremer, Nazi, racist, homo, nothing.. is this the same guy who&#39;s tweets I see?Bernie appears to be sincere and to care deeply about people. As a European, I just fucking love the idea of him becoming president of the US. America would finally give a positive image to the world.Bernie is every adjective at once.Vote Bernie for the inside scoop on aliens!  Of course announced here first on JREThanks for allowing any presidential candidate to come on and speak their piece on anything they want and for how long they want. You may not realize it now, but when you and your team look back on your work....you can honestly say, &quot;yeah, we did good&quot;. Something executives at  Fox, CNN, NBC, etc....cannot say with a full heart.Holy Shit BERNIE! I hope he asks him about Alex Jones confronting him...lol.bernie is the only one who can beat trump. bernie 2020Could you imagine how many views Joe interviewing Trump would get?When I was watching Brother Cornell being interviewed by Brother Joe I knew he is gonna offer to introduce him to Brother Bernie. Glad it turned out so. Thank you Brothers.yooooThe perfect form of debate would be to have Trump and the democrat candidate both on Rogans podcast at the same time for like 3 hours with Joe moderatingnobody has the right to someone else&#39;s labor. that is called slavery.* after over*   &quot;Jamie have you seen my wallet?&quot;Jafar&#39;s parrot escapedMeshugga Bernie is from a 1932 time capsule... handing out communist party pamphlets on Delancey street, and worshipping uncle Joe Stalin. Only pocahontas the $5 whore, is crazier than this nudnik.Bullshit stop blaming mentally ill people. So all  nazi&#39;s were mentally ill? Every one in the confederacy was mentally ill?Congratulations to Joe Rogan for putting the final nail into the mainstream media coffin. By the way Bernie, expanding Medicare to 19 million under Johnson is nothing like expanding it to cover the nearly 400 million Americans in the US in terms of taxes required to pay for it. People from Canada do travel abroad for healthcare that they cant receive in Canada often. Medicare recipients often buy supplemental insurance on top of what the government provides. The advancements in the medical field are mostly found in the US because of the free market pressures for innovation.  All of the people in the US who can not obtain insurance on their own are provided for through Medicaid and Medicare which means the US does provide it as a human right for those who can not provide for themselves. All others have the freedom to obtain it on their own. Freedom of expression is a human right, yet we don&#39;t expect the government to buy every person a pen and paper.Why didn&#39;t joe ask Bernie about not paying his own employees a livable wage?POO POO PIKEr PepeLaughThank you for inviting Bernie! I LOVE this!Sanders had no solutions to any of the problems he mentioned. The man without a plan is a fool!  He wants people to take to the streets so he can live his socialist utopia fantasy.. total fraudDo Democrats believe in science when it comes to gender and sexMany of the things he has brought up have also been brought up by President Trump. One in particular was the price of medicine. He made the same exact claim that Bernie just made about the pricing policies here in the US. What Trump has proposed is to make our drug policies the same as the prices around the world . And he explained that the reason webpay more for our medication is because of the fact that drugs are cheaper in other countries. The same goes with trade. Yet when Trump has brought it up, the media won&#39;t show it and continue to push the &quot;racist, biggot, homophobe &quot; accusations.Thomas Sowell please.Commie Sanders. GO FUCK YOURSELFJRE is better than any media outlet, period.Joe should interview Stephanie Kelton.UBI effectiveness &gt; raising min wage effectivenessBernie jumping on the Rogan band wagon after Yang and Gabbard.&quot;I am worried about what is going on in education today&quot;<br />Yeah, 12 years of government indoctrination and the brats are not even worth a &quot;living wage&quot;. Lets extend that perverted incentive and incompetence to before and after grade school as well.<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Everybody know the ages of zero to four are the most important... Childcare workers are paid starvation wages... working class families cannot find afforable childcare.&quot;<br />Here is an idea, stop fucking taxing parents so one of them can fulfill the biological imperative of being a parent at home.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Tax on wall street speculation&quot;<br />Why stop there, why not have a tax on main steet speculation. Every time you leave your house you are speculating on getting somewhere, you should be taxed to leave your own house!<br /><br /><br />&quot;Kids leaving colledge with high debt.&quot;<br />Remind me again about why kids are unemployable after 12 years of government indoctrination, and how extending that for four+ years will fix anything?I came into this with a really open mind but he isn&#39;t answering the questions. I cannot believe America would consider electing these people or anyone who finds simple questions hard to answer. If you want Medicare for all tell me: how much will this cost, how the money will be sourced, how the plan will be implemented. I know his intentions are not pure because he won&#39;t give accurate details on any of this. All he proposes is a president lead workers union. What tffffffWealth inequality isn’t a problem.  Poverty is.  They are not the same thing.All we need is a Precrime taskforce. Way to go Joe by not pushing back on his crazy. Let him expose himself.👍👍👍👍👍Why do I feel like he just had a pastrami sandwich ?Donald Trump next up to batHave Kevin O’Leary on!I watched all of this. What  The Actual Fuck? This guy sounds like an under the covers communist.Lol assault weapons!!! Lol free healthcare! You CANT get any doctor you want in Canada! You show up and you get put on a waiting list you take what they got. <br />Lol idk about you guys but everyone I see working minimum wage jobs where I’m at are the shitheads that don’t do anything with their life. <br />Good luck keeping good quality colleges when they are free to attend.By the way , for those of you out of high school who found this interview educational . Your morons . Yes there needs to be election reform has been needed for a while . Also look at who donated to Bernie&#39;s campaign.  Follow the money . It&#39;s not hardThe Dems will knock him out with the superdelagates again if they have to.yessss... bernie!!!!You&#39;ve sank to an all time low... I&#39;ve unsubscribed... What a piece of shit Bernie is... Bye pal, I&#39;ve lost all respect for you.Joe you need to make these Bernie interviews longer.Let’s talk about how amazing Bernie did at answering every single question with A very reasonable answer that Joe through At him and how amazing Joe did interviewing him one of the best shows in Some timeJRE=ultimate media respectFor my ppl curious about the numbers breakdown on Tuition Free College, Medicare for All and Bernie’s tax rates:  <br />Medicare for all increases taxes across the board but the average family will save $4K annually because the private tax of premiums, deductibles, copays, hidden fees etc will be gone. Every middle to lower class family will save money on this plan and it’s $5 Trillion cheaper (over a decade) than what we’re doing now.  <br /><br />Tuition Free PUBLIC Colleges ($70B annually) doesn’t even involve a tax hike. It’s paid for by a financial transaction tax on Wall Street. This would raise $112B-$450B annually. Wall Street won’t even feel it, The plan is a 0.5% tax rate for stock trades, a 0.1% rate for bond trades, and 0.005% for derivatives transactions.<br /><br />Here’s Bernie’s tax plan: <a href="http://www.bernietax.com/">http://www.bernietax.com/</a><br />Here’s how he plans to pay for his ideas: <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all?inline=file">https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all?inline=file</a>How much money do you have Bernie and how did you get it? Joe won&#39;t ask that very weak👎👎Wow, this was one of the worst softball interviews you&#39;ve ever done Joe. You didn&#39;t press Bernie to answer any questions regarding his policy proposals and at one point you even permitted him to state the known falsehood of gun show loopholes as fact. I work at gun shows in several states and can tell you it&#39;s false. There is just too much wrong with this interview to go through it all... very disappointing.Get Donald Trump on The JRESoftball Interview Joe......U.S. health care spending grew 3.9 percent in 2017, reaching $3.5 trillion or $10,739 per person.  VS. In 2018, total health expenditure in Canada is expected to reach $253.5 billion, or $ 6,839 per person. The 10% of Canadian families who earn an average income of $60,850 will pay an average of $5,516 for public health care insurance, and the families among the top 10% of income earners in Canada will pay $37,361. VS. According to the CDC, during 2015 health expenditures per-person were nearly $10,000 on average. (edit this post below)&quot;We need more laws on guns&quot; but what about the laws against murder these monsters wont listen to laws more people need to carry guns there are bad people out there that want to hurt people and they will do it no matter what protect yourselves peopleLying Bernie you been a politician for like 90 years and havent done anything that you keep saying youre going to do or should be done.PLEASE VOTE FOR BERNIE<br />He&#39;s a man of the people, not some corrupt politicianThis is real journalism Joe Rogan is a reasonable guy who allows everybody a platform with no bias.If the real free market were allowed to come back that would help fix the healthcare system through competition.Soren Kierkegaard spent a lot of time writing about despair, life don&#39;t give a fuck what happens to you or your family. People need something to hold on to and science offers nothing in regards to that, find some hope and care for it. Maybe in the future you will have a garden that future generations can partake of.Free health care!!!BERNIE!!!!!Awesome.  Nothing like an interview with someone who spent their honeymoon in the 1970s in Moscow, and recently had to lay off staff in order to meet his precious $15 an hour wage.  Old Bernie is a true believer, a tried and true old-school Marxist, he hates the kulaks and would  demand another Holodomor against modern kulaks if he could get away with it.  Knowing many people in Vermont as I do, he must bring home the bacon because otherwise they&#39;d toss this jackass out of office. So you see, contrary to what Bernie says, it&#39;s ALL about the money...  And so is he.  The worst kind of hypocrite possible.Bernie literally had no real answers to the questions he asked itListening to this podcast literally just convinced someone (me) who never tunes into debates and was undecided on who to vote for (if I’d even vote at all) to 100% now turn out to vote for Bernie Sanders.  Powerful stuff.  Incredibly smart move of Bernie Sanders to come on the podcast.  This is a game changerWhether Bernie is a good guy or not is mostly irrelevant. You&#39;re not marrying him and you&#39;re not going to have a beer with him. It&#39;s a candidate&#39;s IDEAS that have to be good. Are they practical? Will it all work out the way they claim? My opinion people made the same mistake with Obama. It&#39;s why I mostly don&#39;t care that Trump can be an insensitive prick.Our generations Larry KingAs I&#39;ve told many people I know, I like Bernie as a person. I just disagree with him too much politically to ever cast a vote his way.I think what Bernie is trying to say is America is not the best country in the world right nowBaltimore and Detroit could be helped by not having corrupt complete democratic control for decadesBoooo. Bernie is the king of communism.smart guy, polar opposite of 45guns are not a problem in the usa<br />its objectively false that guns are the reason behind these shootings<br />making it harder for LAW ABIDING CITIZENS i repeat because idiots like bernie don&#39;t seem to understand this, <br />LAW<br />ABIDING <br />CITIZENS,<br /> to own guns will do absolutely nothing but create a massive and incredibly dangerous black market <br />making guns is not hard<br />literally all the blueprints are public information and available online for free<br />all it takes is one gun to make a blueprint so censorship is out of the question<br />once that industry is created it will be impossible to shut down and will create even more dangerous gangs and shooters because ALL of their weapons will be fully automatic<br /><br />educate yourself bernie, before you try to ruin this country preferablyHahah I just see bernine passing legislation so he can do Castro like long form speeches.  Zero chance of being elected mate.  Health care is not a human right.  Look after your own health.  If you stuff your face, get fat, its on you mate.Bernie seems like a very reasonable guy, how did Trump and Hillary win over him?I’m am hotel driver in Vermont and literally everyday a at least 1 group of Flight Attendants ask me about Bernie, whether I have seen him downtown or walking around lol...i don’t know anything about the guy but what better way to get to know him than on a Joe Rohan podcast...here goes nothing..NahLet him off easy with that &quot;assault rifle&quot; bullshit.I&#39;d love to see Trump on here. Dood! LolLet&#39;s see ya bring up DMT now Joe Rogan!!BooooooooooThis is gonna break records for sureeThis is like Bernie Sanders ASMRBernie is Burned LOLBernie Sanders is the candidate who fights for the people. 💖 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotMeUs">#NotMeUs</a>Less than 12 years lmao...joe should&#39;ve charged money for this as a comedy special20 minutes in and Joe hasn&#39;t challenged him once. I hope this whole thing isn&#39;t just Bernie saying whatever he wants without having to defend his ideas.<br /><br /><br />Edit: Bernie knows nothing about guns, admits an assault weapons ban has been done before (it was an automatic weapons ban, im not sure what Bernies definition of assault weapon is) admits the ban may not do much, admits hes not sure how to fix the problem, but wants to take our guns anyway. And Joe doesn&#39;t challenge him on that. Im really disappointed in this Interview. JRE is my favorite and most listened to podcast but this was weak.POWERFUL JRE!Bernie should be sponsored by Halls throat lozenges.What&#39;s up with all these short interviews:(Both there heads are shiny AFLIKE TO GET TRUMP ON THE PODCAST!Bernie/ Tulsi 2020Bernie sounds good when hes reciting talking points at a rally or something but when he actually sits down and tries to Have an in-depth conversation, its transparent how out of his leaque this all isThank you Joe. I love you Bernie.WOW I’m so pumped to watch this let get itJoe Rogan tapped out to Bernie Sanders! C&#39;mon, Joe! What were you thinking?! Let Jordan Peterson ask him questions about the viability of Socialism next time, please. JBP is a cordial Canadian that sees what Bernie is offering in real time.pls dont die bernie we need u make sure u take ur vitamins and stay in good health plsLarry David for President!Bernie Sanders has a very soothing voice. I&#39;m getting ASMR tingles.That’s great to see Bernie Sanders on Joe Rogan, and I’m a Trump supporter and I will watch this whole podcast to learn more about Bernie supporters and he’s views.I will pay cash money to see Bernie on DMT.Bernie with Nina Turner as his running mate would be pretty coolThis guy is a liar and a very dangerous individual he hates America while praising Communists if he got elected kiss your freedom goodbye vote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a> to save America from asshole like this 😈Bernie is going to drop out and support Biden this time around.A lot of people with guns didn&#39;t get then legally. Banning guns won&#39;t help anyone.You piss off the rich and america becomes broke and we all lose our jobs. Alot needs fixed but we need to do it in a way that keeps corporations in America... We have done this before and we lost alot of work. As long as it&#39;s done in a smart way it might not suck. (which I dont think there is a good outcome to with his plans)He makes a great point about mental health. A broken arm and a broken brain both need treatment. I think people with mental health issues are shoved aside because nobody looks at someone with a broken arm and labels them as a freak. But the brain dictates behavior, and so it goes.&quot;I like Joe, he&#39;s my friend... but... he&#39;s high on DMT, but he&#39;s my friend&quot; Bernie SandersBernie is going to win this thing. He&#39;s got the receipts. Dude has my vote.Great interview, need more of these.I find it crazy that there are some Americans against a national health service. Here in Scotland we pay a tiny amount towards our NHS through taxes and I&#39;d happily pay more if I had to. I&#39;ve never paid for prescriptions, never paid for a visit to hospital or the doctors, I pay £15 whenever I visit the dentist, I paid £60 to have my wisdom teeth removed, I paid £0 when I nearly died from food poisoning in Spain at 6 years old and had to be rushed back to a Scottish hospital and had a 3 week stay. I paid £0 when I collapsed, used an ambulance and had an overnight stay. I paid £0 when I broke my hand in a bike accident and I also love the fact a homeless person or anyone who struggles in society has access to health care free of charge if they were ever in a time of need. American health system is NOT normal!&#39;Prison is disproportionately brown and black&#39; - not if you account for violent crime, then it&#39;s proportionate.Don&#39;t be fooled by his bullshit. He is arguing against capitalism, not just healthcare. He is a tyrant.I fucking hate this Keynesian Commie. Government interference in free markets is what empowers these fascist monopolies he’s bitching about, and his solution is more governmental interference in free markets. Just get government out of these markets and allow open competition to drive costs down and quality up. I don’t expect this fucking wacko to say anything about real economic understanding though.Holy  @#$%  Rogan actually listened to my brother Dr. Cornel West.   Finally.  FINALLYThe section around 35-40minutes is straight up propaganda. &quot;Assault weapons&quot; (not a thing), &quot;hundreds of mass shootings a year&quot; (yeah when you manipulate the definition) etc. Joe really dropping the ball this episode.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> ✊🏽rogan only 1 out of four in mentaly illI&#39;m a middle class American citizen with zero student loan debt and only a high school diploma.<br />Learn the TRADES that make this world spin <br />It took me 9 years to get here and I am loving life!<br />You dont need college, dont waste your twenties accumulating debt and partying!Holy shit, it&#39;s Bernie! I never miss JRE for a reason. I am often pleasantly surprised by who turns up for a chat.Bernie says, &quot;I could yell and take my clothes off.&quot; Had to pause for like thrity seconds to wipe that from my brain.If you want to curb the influence of lobbyists, limit the power of the federal government. If it wasn’t so all powerful, companies wouldn’t be spending billions to influence it.Not to the military obviously. Then Martial law and bam. Checkmate. I want so bad to trust this guy but most of this podcast is geared towards that. Oh and will the military be able to keep selling them to terrorist organizations? Something has to change but I don&#39;t believe taking away more freedoms is the answer.Props to Bernie.Get Trump on next then pal.Ubi&gt; min wage. But min wage better than nothing.He&#39;s pro worker never worked a day in his lifeCommunistAll he does is cry and cry and cry and cry and all he has is some dumb shit advice of how to make things betterBernie talking about greed is funny.  The it that wants to steal my money to give healthcare go illegal immigrants.15 hour shift tommorow? I need to stay up late and watch this.I am actually Very Pro gun, but how hard can it be to add say a reference requirement to buy a gun... When you apply for a job cleaning floors they ask for personal and professional references and talk to people you know personally and professionally before you get to clean a floor so it doesn&#39;t feel hard or like to much to have someone talk to a friend for 5 mins about how someone wants to buy a gunwrong on global warming Bernie. We are entering into a Grand Solar Minimum. You know of what I type.Bernie got nervous when Joe asked him about aliens...Can you imagine if he actually became President and then came back on JRE and told us all about aliens :OHad to start my own business because college is so expensive...I dont want to hear that murderer are mentally sick. No shit. In that case if somebody is found to be mentally sick lets just put them all down before they do something &quot;crazy&quot;.@PowerfulJRE The 2A is not just about defense against criminals; it’s about preservation of liberty.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=40m49s">40:49</a> didn’t answer the question fuck-tard.🙄🙄Joe should just host his own debate show - bring in Warren, Bernie, Harris, Biden and Yang in one room and give him 5 hours to debate. Done.It&#39;s amazing to me that this cat can chew on his tongue while speaking and not drool all over himself.I was really hoping Joe would have  Bernie hit the blunt like Elon Musk did.I lost support for him after he got hung up on tv time. I don’t have a tv for years. How are the time slots fair? He’s too old an stubborn but still home to some good over due ideas. He shouldn’t be at the wheel but he can point out some shits to the kids in the back.Democrats would be stupid to not pick him to run against trumpSoon, people will realize the importance and intelligence behind this interview.I voted Democrat for 30yrs. I gave Bernie $150.  Then he goes and supports Hillary... I voted for Trump out of spite, but have come to love him.  Go away Bernie, you had your chance, then betrayed us.  MAGA!I like Joe and Bernie and I&#39;m all for studies, but in 2017 they did the largest brain study on adhd and found structural differences vs normal brains... it&#39;s real, our brains are different. We aren&#39;t just rambunctious. To often I basically hear ADD/ADHD isn&#39;t real on this podcast :(<b>HOLY ..... SHIT .....</b><br /><br />Sanders 2020 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Expanding Medicare doesn’t sound outrageous until you see the tax hikesPeople carry a gun and defend yourself.Damn this is surrealProbably I would have enjoyed listening to Bernie before, but after discovering <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AndrewYang">#AndrewYang</a>, Bernie sounds just like other typical politicians who can&#39;t really offer clear solutions and laser focus on problems of the 21st century... Andrew Yang is fresh air and hope...That time when president Sanders went on JREThat last question is why Joe is the MOTHERFUCKIN MAN!!This marks the death of mainstream mediaThis guy doesn&#39;t pay his own people 15 an hourBernie’s ideas are just way too utopian. “How are you going to pay for that, Bernie?”  “WE’LL TAX THE RICH!” Every time.Joe: &quot;Have you tried DMT?&quot;<br />Bernie: &quot;Do you mean the Democrat&#39;s Money Transitioning?&quot;Show I didn&#39;t dislike the video because you had Bernie Sanders on your program I dislike the video because I think Bernie Sanders is a communist f*** Wit and the things he was proposing or not only going to start a civil war but if they end up winning it will completely destroy any hope this nation had left the world had left. Bernie Sanders if you read this I think you&#39;re a coward and a traitor to your country and your countrymen you should be grossly ashamed of yourself you are a wicked person and I sincerely hope that you come to realize this and change your ways. If not though I will see you in the rest of your disgusting commie brood on a Battlefield and trust me son I&#39;m not going to be hurling my love at you.I’m Canadian Canada 🇨🇦 o agree with Bernie on the universal health care - however please take notice 40% tax bracket I’m 3 hrs away from Windsor, Ontario however I do go to the USA for a colonoscopy because I can’t wait 7 months for my next appointment. Just to make sure I’m okay with my current medical problem. My doctor agrees with my travel medical decisions. I could have been dead by now. The tumor was detected if I waited not sure I’d be writing this right now. So I pay out of pocket.Bernie is the only choice!Dnc don’t u mean dmtHoly softballs.  Didn’t challenge any of his premises, this is a Bernie commercial not an interview.Actually you can tell how desperate Bernie is when hes on Joe rogan...... I am laughing my a** off right nowThe price of goods will shoot up if minimum wage goes way up and it will only move numbers around and accelerate inflation which will be a very uncomfortable and harsh transition for the economy.Bernard knows what’s good for him and his campaign. Happy as hell to see him and Tulsi engage the way they do.👍🏼Sernie Banders on Roe Jogan.What a crock of shit. So Bernie bitches about our debate formats being silly and how long form, detailed discussions of issues were better on basically the only damn media form that allows for the thing he’d prefer?<br /><br />I’ve always held a lot of respect for Joes format. It’s really the right way to have this discussion and there’s no one like it, but fuck me. The irony of what they opened the discussion with to only let Bernie do a 1:1 regurgitation of tired political lines with nothing deeper...is truly fucking insane.Bruh! This is going to be good. He needs to get Andrew Yang back on. Yang has the better ideas.That last question sealed it for me... BERNIE 2020 😁I live in Canada and No major heart surgery patient spends a month in the hospital..l was in the hospital overnight and the man next to me was being released  after major heart surgery in less then 24 hours, his family were freaked out to take him home.  Most non emergency  surgeries have 2 or more years waiting lists, and we are so freaking highly taxed .  Our system moves you out of the hospital asap and prescription s are not included...neither is rehabilitation of any kind that comes out of pocket. Sorry Bernie 90 per cent of what you said about healthcare  in Canada is misinformation.Best interview ever if your a waaky comy .Bernie may know the issues but he didnt in this interview explain how it would solve them, He had an hour to convince me but he just told me what i already know. He didnt give any detailed plans on how to solve the problems accept how he would pay off student debt from taxing wallstreet thats was one plan and how he would change the health care system but thats just copying other countries health systems, He could of been more prepared he says he will work with experts but why not tell us what some experts think would solve the problems but again like every other politician he can tell us all the problems but he has no answer to how he would actually fix them. <br /><br />Ill give you one example of how i would fix the issue of affordable housing the goverment builds affordable housing and the buyers only pay cost price so no profits can be made but all costs including labour are paid making the house affordable so your not buying the house at market rates witch often makes them very unaffordable? This would create jobs too but at no real cost to the goverment as any money spent would be reclaimed on the house sale.Colonel Sanders looks so different without the moustacheSo only two presidential candidates have been on JRE.... and as a result, they&#39;re the only two candidates I have a clear-cut idea of what they actually believe! As Sanders says here: everyone&#39;s looking for 30 second sound bytes. You can&#39;t find a simple 30 second answer for a complicated problem, especially in a nation with millions of people. God I wish I could hear every candidate in an extended, candid and uncensored interview like this. That includes Trump.Bernie 2020!Like him or not, you have to admit that he’s honest and fights for what he believes in rather than being led by polls or money.Shall not be infringed. The 2nd has nothing whatsoever to do with hunting. Why do these potential tyrants always bring up how they support hunting when they&#39;re plotting to take our rights?Modest tax??? WTF......Capital gains is a 20% tax for the big investors. And come on.....Mean salary for a doctor in the USA is at least $200K a year. And they can&#39;t pay back their student loans???I disagree with almost everything Bernie believes in, but I respect the hell out of him for coming on the podcast.This fuckin guy is living in a ding dang ol wet dream if he thinks taking guns away is gonna keep criminals from getting em anyways. Fuck that old geezer dude. And fuck all of Vermont for birthing him. Fuckin idiot dude Jesus Christ I love your show Joe, but I feel like I just wasted an hour of my time listening to an old fart with whimsical fantasy vision.I also got a 10% raise by my &quot;evil&quot; top 1% company ...idiot<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> 🔥🔥🔥Bernie Sanders trying to get that Andrew yang crowd..... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>  lol Andrew yang is the one who said reality TV show right on stage.... smhJoe &quot;Suprise Mother F#%ker&quot; RoganBernie Sanders is a nut sackThere is already a tax on stocks/bonds being sold, it&#39;s called capital gains. Bernie is referring to a fee to buy/sell.All you have to do is look at how long the time stamp is,, anything under 1hr 30min, and you will know the interviewee really has nothing intersting to sayThis would be better if Ron Paul was in the room to balance some of the crazy with logic. Bernie means well i guess. At least hes not a full blown liar like the establishment candidates but tulsis better.Passing on this one. Can’t wait for the next podcast.I&#39;m A newzealander, the govts response to our mass shooting is text book how NOT to deal with the event. rushed legislation forced through with no input from anyone who knows about firearms. they banned ALL semi auto rifles because they declared a .308 mostly wooden hunting rifle is the same thing as an AR-15. They have destroyed the local sport shooting community and treated law abiding citizens as criminals. they called it a buy back but refuse to pay the same price you paid to legally by your firearm, its straight up robbery. we have no idea how many of these weapons are here or who has them because we had no register. so if someone wants to they can easily hide their guns to keep them. this means that only the most law abiding citizens are turning these guns over, obviously bad guys wont be, we have not made one bit of fucking difference to safety with this rushed emotionally driven response.FEEL THE FUCKIN&#39; BERRRRRNNNNNNN Every single thing he said makes perfect sense but too many idiots consumed by tribalism and their own ego will hit dislike and continue to vote for people who lie to them.  Ya&#39;ll need some DMT to kick your egos to the curb so you can see past your tribal bullshit and evolve with the rest of us<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> 💙<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%2340YearsOfConsistency">#40YearsOfConsistency</a> 💯<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NoMiddleGround">#NoMiddleGround</a> ✊<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MedicareForAll">#MedicareForAll</a> 📢Just waitin for the dumb ass conservatives to start yelling &quot;SOCIALIST&quot;Minimum wage.... <br />Bernie - &quot;I don&#39;t have the numbers in front of me.....&quot;<br />WHY DON&#39;T YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF YOU. YOU KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE IN THE INTERVIEW.There should be more political figures on the show and even bring on a left and right wing figure to debate and see the comparisons and differences especially considering this isn&#39;t the news so there&#39;s soo much more freedom.6 mins in and here comes the free healthcare  lmaoHe should get Obama on the podcast, I think he would say yes.&quot;Reality TV Show?&quot; That&#39;s Yang&#39;s line. Yang Gang!Fuck you both Joe...Now bring on Trump!  &quot;Joe I have been waiting for this a very...very...very long time. This is going to be great it&#39;s already fantastic.&quot;  Hahahaha<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m30s">1:04:30</a> oops, I think he meant japan not chinaIf this is a simulation... this guy bitches a lotStill won&#39;t vote for him...bernie never looks at Joe - no eye contact. what&#39;s that all about?I am curious where Sanders thinks the medical research comes from. South Korea and the USA. I wonder why... oh yeah no socialized health care. BEWARE of millionaires masquerading as socialists. Bernie is rich as fuck.Yang 2020Is it me or does Bernie have a John Wayne epicness to his voice now?Bernie is so full of shit another 0 here 1 here it just works fine like other country.  And for kids that are in student debt you’re 18 years old read the fucking contract and you wouldn’t be in this position you if you did.  You  a join the military and diet at 18 but you can’t read  a contract about debt. You deserve to be in debt. Don’t go to college if you cant get a degree that will pay off your debt!If you truly want change realize these people are not our leaders but our representatives then we may be able to take control  of our own lives and not let these people control ours.This dumb old grifter? His entire plan is flawed<br /><br />Get Trump on damnit!Pretty annoying that Joe changes his expressed beliefs based on who is in the current podcast.15$ an hour for entry level jobs, laughable. That&#39;s why he had to cut the hours of his own employees. Because he had to start paying his own employees 15$ an hour. But Joe won&#39;t bring that up.Hearing liberals talk about guns is so cringe.So glad he threw the alien question in thereI wish You could interview every candidate Joe! I&#39;m a Conservative American and I have enjoyed hearing Bernie Sanders comments and actual point off view, didn&#39;t agree with everything he said..... but got a much better view him as another American! Thanks Joe, and Bernie!that happened.Thumbs up for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a>Joe “slow pitch” RoganWow sorry bernie you are full of shit. I&#39;m a working man 50ish k a year thx god to trumps tax cuts. I&#39;ve seen alot more money.  I can finally save to start my own businessYou know what&#39;s wild? I got TWO medication ads while watching this.That was weak I learned nothing new about this man to convince me he’s the oneIt&#39;s crazy that a podcast, not CNN, NBC, FOX News, etc, etc, is better at getting information across from a presidential candidate than formal news outlets. I&#39;ve been following the JRE podcast for a while, but this is definitely the moment at which I realized that I will FOREVER follow the podcast. After interviewing x amount of people, Joe Rogan did a wonderful job of getting the answers that the standard American wants to hear.How can you trust someone with economic issues when they don’t know how ridiculous a federal minimum wage is. Does he really think the minimum wage for someone living in New York City should be the same as someone in rural Mississippi? He just says shit people want to hear his actual policies and points are retarded.7.5k dislikes? did they even have time to watch the whole thing before they sent their click farms and dislike bots? [edit] I just looked up the Ben Shitpiro interview and that has a better dislike/like ratio lmao.. I guess that says more about Joe&#39;s audience.. yikes... some awfully ignorant people around here.. that guy is literally an open transphobe and hypocrite right wing grifter and they can&#39;t see through that? like wha...Yang and Tulsi episodes were way better (way better candidates too)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=56m15s">56:15</a> how many of the 40 million in poverty are immigrants or children of immigrants. If it&#39;s a substantial amount, maybe we should close down the borders to poor people who want to move here.Amazing! Thanks Joe!1) Canada has far less people. 2) many Canadians come here for healthcare because the waiting list for surgery is outrages. Also taxes there are really high.How about stop making bullets for the AR&#39;s. That&#39;s how you ban things. Take away the bullets and those guns are useless.This is what a man of the people looks like. Trump fakes being a man of the people but he&#39;s literally a New York trust fund billionaire who drives around in black limos and has gold everything, including his hair. Still don&#39;t blame people for preferring him to Clinton in 2016 though.People are not even taught to be responsible for their own actions.. To be smart enough to live within their means.  Average person has adult toys, latest model cars, or smartphones or debt on a car they can&#39;t afford, eating out too often etc etc etc...  We are being spoiled and as a result we complain more and more while doing less and less for ourselves.  I think you should behave as though you are in the depression era, grow vegetable at their homes, mow their own lawns, and build towards their future. It has worked for many families including oursFree education would be great if they hadn&#39;t become Churches for the woke, if this guy wants to raise taxes he needs to reform all kinds of areas before that. The problem is that he thinks he can fund all this by just taxing the rich, when in many reality they will find ways to avoid or simply invest elsewhere with lower tax rates. He should be honest, like the nordic countries that tax workers very high, can only afford there programmes because of high income tax rates. Its either that or quadruple the debt, just increasing taxes on the 1% won&#39;t be enough for these programmesAt mark <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m41s">5:41</a> he says the function our healthcare system is to make insurance companies and big pharma billions, then Obama care failed and it was a wasted 8 years. The dems also wasted 3 years on russiagate.Bernie with all the answers for the demand side and no answers for the supply side. Not even close Bernie, sorry.Aw man thought it was the soccer playerIs Jamie not going to “pull up” one f-ing thing?The US just experienced the coldest and wettest October to May in the last hundred years. Just putting that out there.Jre 2020Yep solar and wind huh, no nuclear burnie bro? I dont understand why every looks over nuclear energy 🤦🏻‍♀️Just audibly went &quot;no fucking way&quot;  when I found thisPredicting seeing some of the other candidates on JRE nowSo glad he came on this show. I don&#39;t support all his points but really enjoy the open discussion. Not just 60 seconds so Joe, you have stepped on something big brother.Joe your just a Legend for this one ..Who&#39;s NEXT?! TRUMP!?It took ole Bern an hour and three minutes to say it but, yes, yes Bernie, you have utopian dreams....I&#39;m a Canadian and referring to his Healthcare comment most of us will die before we get our care in the US I can have my back surgery done and be back to work in like 11 weeks here in Canada it&#39;s been 13 years and they refuse to do surgery stating it&#39;s too dangerous my uncle who lives in the states hadn&#39;t even serious more serious back injury and it was 11 weeks from the date of a surgery to when he was able to go back to work so do you want our Healthcare go ahead but expect your level of care to go from a nine or a 10 two or three or four if you&#39;ve got money you might be able to get a 5 or 6 but if you&#39;re poor like me good luck oh and enjoy the minimum 10 hour wait line at the emergency room I weighed 18 hours to get my hand stitched up by the time they went to stitch it up the wound had to be cut open again so I had to go into surgery also a large portion of my hand died because they waited too long and I had to go in for a second surgery and have a skin graft done and they had to replace that dead piece of skin with a piece of skin from the front of my hip not from the back and a week after that surgery the stitches ripped open because they took it from the tightest spot on my body and that got infected and I almost died and that was Healthcare 10-15 years ago you don&#39;t want to know the health care we have now f*** you Bernie you talk out your ass just like the Liberals talk out their f*<b>***</b> ass here in Canada we need a trump here in Canada to tell us like it is but there&#39;s too many pussies and not enough dicksBernie &quot;other countries are doing it&quot; SandersVery good interview on point!!NO SUCH THING AS AN &quot;ASSAULT WEAPON&quot;Bernie is genuinely a person that wants to run for president, not for himself but for the people.Finally so many Joe Rogan listeners will listen to Bernie Sanders and judge for themselves if he is a communist or just an honest American fighting for the middle class.Only an hour?!?!?!  Wth Toe Hogan!!he doesn&#39;t even mention government guaranteed student loans being the cause of sky high tuition. this is embarrassing. appreciate Joe for having him, but wish he&#39;d challenge him at least a littleHe never answers Joe’s questions. I wish Joe would have called him out on it.thank you for asking the questions that needed to show me im sure on my voteIts nice to see bernie talking about these issue with free mind no media bullshitAre we still building up to the Kanye West Interview?I can get behind everything except cancel all student debt, no way will wall street go for a speculation tax, not a single chance, they will form a private securities market, it&#39;s been done before, and the response was to privately trade between &quot;two entitites&quot; and eliminate the &quot;speculation&quot;.Clive Palmer bought 60 million dollars worth of advertising in the last Australian election, he later admitted that he never wanted a senate seat but only entered to stop Labor forming a government. All over the world rich people can just buy elections.bernie is a great dude but as many politicians.... he shouldnt be oneFinally!Ffs. Fnckin politics.Half way into this and Bernie has not answered the “how” of all these promises....just the “what” these promises are.<br />Whatever happened to the principles of scarcity and abundance or supply and demand.  You know, what we learned about in high school?So Bernie becomes president and changes tax policies to make all these companies pay their fair share. What is keeping them from saying screw this and move to another country?There it is, the death of the mainstream media. I disagree with Bernie on just about everything, but this is huge! Nice work Joe.Socialism is evilSmh, Bernie is crazier than Alex Jones. Most of his ideas are like throwing alcohol on a dumpster fire...Sorry I listen to him and just cannot support him at all. Think if he becomes president will be only cause he is buying votes with doing away with student which we cannot afford as a country.Great job Joe, now it would be fair to have the republican candidate on the podcastDonald Trump next.Joe your doing this country a huge service with your platform!Oh, high schools aren&#39;t funded enough to keep kids in school? Correlation isn&#39;t causation. Same kids are abusing drugs and alcohol? What&#39;s the root cause? Don&#39;t worry about the real answers, throw money at it. Thanks for the insights, Bernie.Bernie Sanders is the left wing version of Ron Paul. Both are controlled opposition. Good actors yes.In 2012 a<br />report came out in Psychology Today saying since SSRI&#39;s came out in 1987 most of school shooters through 2004 were either on SSRI&#39;s or coming off of them. Interesting that same report said those under 25 were more likely to have impulsive violent side effects. I tried to share this on Facebook and it was interestingly blocked.Glad to know criminals, with unmarked AR-15s are going to voluntarily go to their local cop shop and hand over their illegally possessed firearms..So what exactly has Bernie done while being in the Senate?Great interview.   But it exposes Bernie’s weakness.   He’s given multiple opportunities to explain specifically how to implement healthcare but all he does is explain what the problem is.   Sanders is great at pointing out what the problem is.  And he’s often correct.   But he’s no idea how to change the system.    Very interesting.This man Bernie looks like he’s about to freestyle over frank sinatra instrumentalsThis pretty much changed my perception on Bernies health due to age. Perhaps I was unfair. He seems very healthy and mentally acute. That said, Tulsi 2020!Why the fuck did u have this moron on your show?  Next stop Hospice....You need Trump on hereBravo Joe Rogan!!13 minutes in, go on Bernie! Truth!Wow! I&#39;m wondering if Joe dont get it just like Bernie dont get it. Real problems. Backward solutions.Dear Joe Rogan, <br /><br />Please interview,  Jamarl Thomas,  Big Daddy Kane, Cindy Sheehan, President Morales and President Maduro. You might have to find a way to smuggle yourself to Venezuela because of the embargo,  but it would be your greatest interview. <br /><br />Sincerely, <br />A fan.Yoohoooo Bernie!!!!!!Why does Bernie lie about the quality of health care in Canada?! Is the VA also a high quality form of healthcare?! Hahaha he&#39;s lost me after 5 minutes.Knee jerk reaction? Nah, m&#39;fer! I work hard for what I have. I&#39;m not interested in paying for liberal protesters and losers who sit around playing video games all day to live as good as me. Get a job and take care of yourselves, you leeches!!!Owning a gun is our God given right. Should we ban cars knowing they kill more people than anything. Mental health is the problem. Sorry his take on gun control is stupid.400 million guns don&#39;t just vanish. Cops who ask too many questions to the wrong law abiding citizens do. lolFuck BernieImagine trump on joe Rogan 🤯are there really more assault weapons in private ownership than the military?bernie?! automatic like. gonna watch this one through. feel the bern!Great 👍This is the new open space for candidates to air their views, dig into issues, make their case, and just be (as much as they can) fucking normal people.  Fuck the networks, let each candidate come onto Joe Rogan for 1 hour, have the space and time to make their case, then next.  Joe is the amongst the most curious, most impartial moderators that could do this.   Imagine this-&gt; he didn&#39;t ask Bernie:  &quot;well, so and so said this about you so how are you going to get them back?&quot;Damn joe nice guests! good job dude.Lmao. Love how Joe fit in the alien question in the last min. I was waiting for it!Joe nice of you to have socialist Bernie on and not ask him any hard questions . Here Bernie tell us all that your going to do and I wont ask where all this moneys coming from , sure just the rich . Also make sure no talking about immigration reform which is hurting the middle class more than anything.  Or how mister Sanders wants to disarm America.  He talks about about Ross Perot and his charts which I liked true transparency.  Bernie where are your charts show me how your plan wont bankrupt the country? Puff piece.  Let all candidates do what you just let happen.  Both dems and Repub. Its interviews like this that piss me off. Joe GET REAL ANSWERS,  ASK REAL QUESTIONS . By the way find out what tax bracket you&#39;ll be in Joewelp its offical im voting for trump again. see ya in 2024 you have dead bastardBernie Sanders; &quot;we&#39;re going to cancel student debt by imposing a tax on wall street speculation.&quot;  WTF does that mean?  Bernie later explains that he would tax individual trades by less than 1/2 of 1 percent.  And that high-speed trading is a form of speculation and this tax would slow down the market and reduce speculation.  So we have a problem with high tuition so let&#39;s tax wall street.  Makes no sense to me.Haha Bernie won&#39;t win peeps!Joe: would you let us know if there are aliens?<br />Bernie: g2g byeSocialism kills. This quack pot dope has been pushing communism and tinpot dictators for decades....if that’s not bad enough, he got almost NOTHING done in congress.Feel the Bern!Thank you Joe Rogan. Thank you.Goddamn Joe has pull!Maybe I vote for Bernie now.America: One of the greatest countries in the world, built on the idea of Neoliberalism/capitalism and freedom.<br /><br />Sanders: bUt SoCiaLiSM ThOFinally I get to see the Bern on the Rogan Experience!!! Fuk yes, Bernie 2020 all day everyday!!! 🤗 🤗 🤗Bernie is a baller for this.Trump 2020 fuck Bernie!Britains NHS is just ludicrous, its poisoning the whole damn country, claiming folks are depressed, anxious, diabetic and anti social, underthyroids when they are just UNHAPPY with there life, any one with half a brain wants it privatised for the protection of the countrys health.&quot;99.9% of gun owners in a million billion years would think of doing these horrible things&quot;- Bernie Sanders <br />Let&#39;s take em any wayThank you Joe Rogan. Amazing interview.He&#39;ll never be president.Joe was not prepared for this conversation at all...these were just fanboy softball questions with no real critical debate.<br /><br />FailThanks Bernie, you just put Trump in office another 4 years! And you were right about one thing, Baltimore is a ShitholeIronic how  a rich J@wis$ man complains about greed and the wealth of the 1%, but refuses to pay his campain aids a &quot;living wage&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=8m37s">8:37</a> many people get trappedPolitician are not for us the American citizens. Every single one of them is a piece of shit and are part of the problem with this country and worldBet Joe&#39;s punk ass won&#39;t have Trump onDid this just happen?Hey Joe, you should have Last American Vagabond, or Brian of High Impact Flix if you want to talk about the real issues. Not this political circus. Politicians are like pro wrestlers, all about the show. Actually... On second thought, that&#39;s not a fair comparison to wrestlers. They at least work hard for a living.Bernie barely ever looked Joe in the eye... Anyone else take note of this?ahhhhh shit. This is gonna get him a ton of votes. Come on trump get on this show LOLSomeone has to pay for these “free” college opportunities, appreciate the thought but realism&gt; socialism.Great job Joe, now it would be fair to have Trump on the podcasti want to see a thumbnail of bernie with the flame throwerI&#39;m all for health care, but all I&#39;ve seen is sick care...bro!(2yrs I was fined for being healthy!) It seems the healthy has to pay for the sick.Bernie is such a crock of shit 😂<br />Bernie IS the problem facing this country. You young bucks that don&#39;t remember who Bernie is and what he represented in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s need to do your research.Fuck Bernie Sanders2010: snowflake effects<br />2019: Bernie Sanders<br />That&#39;s called progress son!<br />Proud of you Joe!You failed joe...enjoy your socialist  agendaCheck out the balls on bernie comming on!  I&#39;m a ron paul man myself but i&#39;m glad he&#39;s here.Thanks, Joe, for a great interview with a great human.99%  of statistics are false show evidence of your claim bernieCouldn&#39;t disagree more with Bernie on 95% of issues, but I&#39;m really glad you brought him on. Now we just need to get Trump on here to get him into a reasonable longform discussion for all to seeHe also keeps saying “assault weapons” as a term to use for AR-15‘s and other similar weapons, which is my biggest political pet peeve. If you are in politics, you need to abide by the ATF’s definition of an assault weapon. There is already legislation banning actual assault weapons… It’s called the NFA, the National Firearms Act, And it’s been around since 1934. It includes actual assault rifles like fully automatic M-16‘s, machine guns, etc. An AR-15 is simply a semi automatic rifle dressed up to look a little scarier.Rogan is toughIs a tax on Wall Street speculation really going to pay for everyone&#39;s college?Fewer than 12 years huh? Didn&#39;t they say that like...over 12 years ago? Said we had 5 years like 12 years ago? Lol🤙🏽🙌🏽👀💙 this was good.Now every candidate it going to try and get on JRE to get our vote...<br /><br />...aint gonna work tho, cause us die hard JRE fans are voting for Eddie Bravo. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lookintoit2020">#lookintoit2020</a>I’ve learned more from joe’s podcast than in collegeSome of our neighbors down the US forget Canada is like the US , we have provinces , you cannot compare Quebec&#39;s healthcare (i invite Bernie to come and visit )vs other provinces ,also health care is not free in Canada , its 500 $ on your annual taxes , and you dont pay unless you really need an operation for health risks ...you can wait for get operated for years .... so people who talk about our health care  like its the best thing in the world , should do their research or come and check it out for themselves . For those who watch mma , check AL Iaquinta interview with Ariel Helwani from his Cowboy fight in Ottawa and hear why he said he wouldnt  fight again in Canada . Canada&#39;s health care doesnt cover  drugs that you need , heck i paid 50 $ for my prescription nose drops last week [ i dont have health insurance ] . The main issue that i have personally is lack of doctors /competent doctors( cardiac surgeon told me they get way less than US ) , which causes huge delay in general either on waiting list  or  in ER or clinic ,I&#39;ve been in Canada 2000&#39;s and still dont have family doctor ... go figure<br /><br /><br />p.s. lil&#39; example i broke my nose  few years ago , went to ER [ it was crooked ] was asked &quot;can you breathe through it&quot; , i  said yes , nurse told me , well we cant fix it since it ll be considered as cosmetic surgery  and also if you want xray you have to wait around 12 hrs in lobby , if you wanna fix it ,  will have to go to the private sector and pay for it .... Thats Quebec Health Care , the hospital is in Montreal [ Verdun ]One Rogan is not enoughI walked away knowing a majority of folk who listen to this shit are demanding hand outs how fucking sad you people aeeShould of asked why my hot Cheetos cost 3.50 per bagSuch an interesting mix of what appears to be intelligent reasoning, with a big helping of nutty-as-a-fruitcake.<br />Didn&#39;t believe when I saw the title... Damn! Joe! you&#39;re good!Please interview Bob Ross nextSo what about all of us who paid our own way through college with jobs and scholarships, and lived in shit cheap housing to avoid loans, while watching other students take out student loans to “afford” first-class housing and go out to dinner every other night? <br />Should we be expecting a check in the mail?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m40s">1:04:40</a>  ---&gt; Japan, not China.Trump next.So exciting!!!Bernie Sanders #1Bernie2020!!!He’s got my voteBernie Sanders doesn&#39;t know anything.The road to hell is paved with good intentions.im so sad its only an hour long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I&#39;m glad Rogan got Bernie on, but this was such a softball interview you&#39;d almost think it was The Rubin Report.America is fucked  with lawHe knows who’s watching, that’s why he came on.I&#39;m now 100% sure this comments section is FULL of trolls paid to make this genuinely good man look evil.Bernie Tulsi YangThis guys a fucking communist<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=3m04s">3:04</a><br />It only took 184 seconds for Bernie to show he hasn&#39;t got any solutions that doesn&#39;t involve the use of force.Please give that man something to suck on.Seconds into the interview and he is already stealing quotes from Andrew Yang &quot;the debates are like a reality tv show&quot; (paraphrased)Old senile man🙄And the Lord said to Samuel, “Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected MeJoe Rogan is our generations johnny CarsonWe must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts, while children in America go hungry.That was such a treat. Great interview by Joe as usual.I like Bernie but I’m sure he’ll raise my taxes and I like my insuranceBernie Motherfucking SandersDude is talking about straight up communism nobody is saying anything against itThis is one of the smartest decisions bernie has made in this campaign.You got Bernie let&#39;s make America communist Sanders on your show but not Ryan Upchurch.......WTF Joe Rogan?!?!?!I love ya Joe but the lack of depth with Sanders you portrayed makes me want to name you Sleepy Joe Rogan.  Call Tim Pool again for some real questionsBernie turned beet red when joe asked him about aliens, he was probably hoping he&#39;d make it through without talking about UFO&#39;sMarijuana ain&#39;t heroindang that side view of bernie really messed me upI’m sorry you lose me at “assault weapons”. Don’t tell me that if you ban ARs people aren’t going to just use a shotgun to kill mass amounts of people. Fix the root cause of it not the cute answer that is going to benefit you in the polls with people who don’t understand gunsThis is the moment in podcast that will be referred to as AB. Everything before Bernie will be referred as BB. Do you remember 30 EBB? (episodes before bernie)This interview was needed.Sanders has suggested atleast a 0.5% tax on stock trades. He clearly knows nothing about the stock market. If you know anything about trading stocks then you know this would simply not work or drive all investors to other countries to trade.All or most of Joes podcast are 2-3 hours  or longer why so short with Bernie because not  much to say but the same old bullshit!...Wants free college/healthcare for 400 million people in the US. Also says he takes offense when people say he wants to steal money through tax to pay for it.why is student debt the priority over all other debt? I&#39;m pretty sure people with student debt aren&#39;t the poorest people in the nation.WHERE&#39;S FUCKING STYXX WHEN YOU NEED HIM?!😈Bernie Sanders won&#39;t have to balls to stand up to big money.  He&#39;ll likely have a mysterious accident.Why is this not 2-3 hours!?This was dope!!the &quot;magical solution&quot;, is changing from a neoliberal set of systems, to progressive systems, and the NEED for weapons, and so many other societal issues, simply evaporates.Straw purchases to ”bad people&quot; is already illegal Bernie. There is no loophole because you&#39;d have lied on the FFL 4473.I thought he had something going until he talked about guns, lost my vote.Bernie 2020I think what Bernie doesn&#39;t realize is that world war 2 the start of Americas military industrial complex is what got us out of the great depression FDR policies didn&#39;t help that much if at allwhaaaaat only 1 hour??? fuck!He&#39;s an idiot. Joe has gone off his freakin&#39; rails.  I&#39;m done!Why so many dislikes? I&#39;m serious, anyone have some reason why I&#39;d like to try to understand. ThanksHe is basically wanting to move wealth all around by force for the greater good whether that is clean energy or affordable housing etc. The cost of all of this is not possible. We owe 22 trillion now. The ideas he is proposing will hurt the middle and lower class by forcing them to spend more on everyday life and the billionaires will still be billionaires. The government doesn’t know how to run a business. We need to bring the individual back the rights they’re owed and keep big government and huge cooperations under control.Wow, Bernie made so many good points!!!America will never be a socialist country!<br />&quot;Progressive Democrats&quot; are the biggest threat to freedom and liberty!<br />Save the US Constitution to save yourself 🇺🇸<br />🖕Commie rat bastards 🤡Colleges these days have too many administrators if you let these people go tuition costs will decreaseThe Democrat party would rather lose to Trump than to let this man get the nomination.Yang on JRE<br />”That&#39;s cool, I&#39;ll check that out.<br />Tulsi on JRE<br />&quot;Hell yeah, I&#39;ll watch that!....boy, it Sure would be cool if Bernie could do an interview&quot;<br />Notification: Bernie on JRE<br />&quot;YYYYAAAASSSSSSSSS!!!!!!&quot;I guess the reason it was only 1 hour is because Joe only had $15 to pay Bernie. 😂 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Bernie&#39;s campaign is already pumping millions into Aisle 518 Strategies. An online media strategy company... that has 50 whole tweets on Twitter. LOL. Suckers. He&#39;s gonna keep pumping millions through there, just like he did with &quot;Old Towne Media&quot; in 2016. Feel your money burn, fools.We both have the same burdens....lol..yall failedeven if Bernie isn&#39;t your cup of tea- this is extremely educational.I love Bernie, but get this man a bottle of water yeesh, dudes clearing his throat every 30 secondsBernie is a Fraud.

I actually found him to be reasonable in this discussion. This will help his campaign.ONE HOUR!? he should have four hours!Smart move coming on JRE...8k idiots stupid enough to believe the very drug/oil/prison/weapons company propaganda hit campaigns he spoke about here disliked this videoIm pretty sure trump fixed the thing with the drug companies price gouging, so bernie is kinda wasting his time.Awesome show, now have Trump and Alex Jones on!Still not a fan of his but give him props for going on rogan.Senator Sanders talks as a human that is trying to bring people together and uplift them as a community, and is genuine. Even if I disagree with some of his policies, this is the quality that I put above all others for a future president..Great episode!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a> He is the best person to provide opportunity and prosperity for our country. Listen to his message with an open mind. His agenda is where pragmatic governing meets compassionate utilitarianism.What&#39;s an assault weapon?HOLY FUCK WHY IS HE STILL ALIVE !!This surprised the shit out of meBernie is a quack on crackWill they allow this to trend in the US?how does Bernie always have a full cup of phlegm in his throat at all timesRemember he&#39;s going to raise the taxes of the same middle class people he&#39;s talking about.

You WILL BE hit with 90% tax rates because unless your not paying taxes Bernie will hit you to pay for all his bullshit ideas ! Think about this if you confiscate ALL wealth it wouldn&#39;t pay for his ideas and then nobody would have anything to grow a business with ! His BULLSHIT ideas don&#39;t work ANYWHERE they are tried !No wayWhen I seen this on my feed: “Oh fuck 😂”..bernie there is NO such thing as an assault weapon!!! definition of assault is an physical attack on..by striking a person..not a gun!!! a gun cant get up and go strike someone, a human needs to intervene..ive never had any of mine get up,walk out of my residence and strike a person..its a word made up by the news media to put more fear into the population..<br /><br />one of the things you could do is ban news media from repeately airing the event over and over for weeks..some of the shooters got the idea from watching news media..the media almost gives them a blueprint of how to do it..<br />also news media doesnt tell that the majority of gun crimes/deaths is by suicide, police, accidents, then mass shootings..news media is biast and dont report both sides..ive never seen a major news media report on a legal ccw save a life and it happens everyday..<br /><br />stop passing more gun laws because the only person it hurts is the law abiding gun owner..criminals dont go through a gun safety course, background checks..concentrate on the mentally ill and criminals..get rid of gun free zones..almost all these events took place at that type of place, ie sandy hook, va tec..and each time there was people who legally could carry and could of stopped the shooter but by law they couldnt carry on person because of the gun free zone..these people who do this know this and target places like this because they know they wont have any resistence till the police show up and that can be over 7 mins..also if someone sees a post on social media or a therapist has a patient that tells them that they are gonna shoot up a place,REPORT IT!!!...some of the shootings were from this.<br /><br />if you disarm the law abiding citizen who can carry a gun to stop events like this, every citizen is gonna have to solely rely on the police to save their life and your gonna have more deaths than saved lives..i dont wanna feel helpless when my life is on the lineIf a Democrat was truly pro 2nd amendment...maybe they would get those republican voters.well,... bernie for president i guessThe year is 2021. President Sanders has just returned from an extended and very private meeting with several world leaders. He announces a return to the JRE hinting at a big announcement. A theremin plays ominously in the background.What&#39;s with the rating ratio? Do people not like this?Joe &quot;I&#39;ll fix this bad election coverage&quot; RoganLove you Bernie, but not impressed with the answer on decriminalization of all drugs.I love Bernie Sanders but would he make the right decision during times of war? Comment and let me know what you think!Jordan Peterson recently said “Joe Rogan is probably the best interviewer of all time”. I don’t agree with Mr.Sanders on much of anything, but I applaud him for coming on here and taking questions.Corporate capitalist policies will be hard to beat they got it all!!$$$!!Bernie says theres no current tax on Wall Street speculators? are you kidding me, trades within a year are taxed as short term capital gains i.e your ordinary income tax rate. you dont need to be an expert in the tax code to know this. Just empty platitudes from Bernard, the guy thinks like a bloody 16 year oldThis feels like the watershed moment for alternative media. Random mma guy joe rogan has a far better interview with a presidential candidate than any mainstream media and reaches vast amounts of people.I voted for Bernie and then he caved and sold out to the Democratic Elites. He did not have the balls to fight the criminal Hillary Clinton machine, now he is old saying the same crap and playing identity politics. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23walkaway">#walkaway</a> of the Democratic Party <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MAGA">#MAGA</a>AR15 ban?  Its semi auto.  Any idiot who has played call of duty knows thats not an assault weapon.   Voting Republican.  No thank you Bernie.Why don&#39;t presidential candidates have YouTube channels dedicated to long-form conversation?  Wouldn&#39;t that be the perfect opportunity for them to explain their positions in detail?  Am I crazy for thinking this?&quot;Raise the minimum wage to a living wage&quot;<br />Why not raise it to an opulent wage, you stingy bastard. Also define &quot;living wage&quot;, because as far as I can tell no one earning minimum wage is dead. Further the real minimum wage is $0 and hour by limiting little an employer can pay to $x, the employer will only hire people who can earn at least $x an hour and fire or limit the hours of everyone who can&#39;t. you are necessarily increasing the number of people &quot;earning&quot; the real minimum wage of $0.Dissapoinment to hear the same boilerplate talking points, just like every other democratic candidate. Was hoping for something more original from Bernie.I do appreciate his position on Student Loan forgiveness. It is insane how you can’t get rid of them no matter what you do, even in death they can sometimes be passed to a spouse or other family members. No bankruptcy relief. No chance of ever paying them off and that was the plan all along, to enslave an entire generation of Americans before they have even started their lives. No chance of getting a house, or anything else. No marriage prospects. No kids. No future. Just makes sure that you are the perfect worker, working nonstop to put all your money into your loan payments. All the while the Loan Principal is getting larger not smaller because you can only make the minimum payment.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie">#Bernie</a> Sanders  or  TulsiJoe: What&#39;s standing in the way of &quot;universal healthcare&quot;? <br />Me: Liberty?<br />Bernie: MONEY! <br /><br />sigh.<br /><br />EDIT: serious props to Bernie for coming on the show though. <br />THANK YOU BERNIE, VERY COOLHere goes a quick mill views.....Get rid of petroleum and you can forget about everything that relies on versatile-affordable plastics, which is virtually everything. Good bye electronics and modern medicine/surgery. Feel the BERN! 😎Joe is the voice of the people!!!Whoa, didn&#39;t see this comingLost me with gun talk. Go fuck your mother. My guns are mine.When Bernie moves to the suburbs... lives in a house without a fence... drives a Hundai... and fly’s in a cattle car.... offers everyone who works from them free meals and health care.. I will vote for him... hahahahahaaaaThe best thing about Bernie is that he&#39;s old AF and will soon enough succumb to natural causes. Communism is evil and should die with him.While I lost respect for him during the last campaign, I&#39;m glad Sanders came on because I think every candidate owes the public a long form discussion like this. I no longer agree with his solutions but I don&#39;t deny that the problems he outlines are real.Both Joe and Bernie (surprisingly) handled the gun debate amazingly. Stayed away from the classic liberal talking points of blaming the Republicans and the NRA 👍🏻Bernie or bust!!!That was a great interview.  Rogan youre more important and influential then any news caster alive.  I have to say though given the long form format I did expect to hear more details.  Still felt like they just skimmed the surface.Goddamn, I hate this. But I’ll give sanders credit, he breaths slowly, therefore saving the rest of us precious oxygenBahahahaha...good bye joe and your bullshit with Bernie...he will never be shitYang Gang pass the torch bernie you old cuckbern why u quick tapp to hillary like conor mcgregor last electionAmazon needs to pay some taxes. BTW, Australia banned semi-automatic &amp; military style weapons in 1996, after a massacre in Port Arthur. Background checks are common sense.Freaking socialistJoe lost alllll edginess.One of the many things I love about Bernie is he has actual plans for raising the money to pay for his ideas. Even though he could legitimately say that we can take it from the military budget since thats up to about 800 billion a year.He is 100% wrong on almost everything related to firearms.This sideways talking shit talker let crooked Hillary have the lead bc she bought his third house but he wants to help poor people and he&#39;s such a great person to hear him telling it. He&#39;s a career politician that hasn&#39;t achieved anything in 30 years. Nothing. But he talks a great game.Americans should give this guy a chance. If it doesn&#39;t work vote him out in his second term. He makes lot of sense to me.I see so many right wingers in the comments super salty but I haven’t heard any of them say his ideas and bad and here’s why. He explains how to pay for it all and how it will help the American middle class, this is why the average person is not doing well in American because you have these authoritarian boot lickers who kiss the ass of the right wing and when someone comes along in the political system who wants to actually help the middle class they label him a super socialist commie. Yes he has socialist views but he agrees with capitalism and likes capitalism, read up on how much federal income tax Exxon mobile and Amazon paided last year they pay little to NONE, yet they make BILLIONS. Most right wing people are just blind followers who don’t look at facts. Bernie Sanders wants to help the average man make a living and be able to feed his family and live a comfortable life. Now another argument is well someone at Macdonalds shouldn’t make 15 dollars an hour my question to that is why not? If someone is working at Macdonald they are working for a multi Billion dollar company and your telling me that can’t make 15 and hour? Basically my view on it is that if your working and helping a company that makes billions in profit each year why are you allowed to make a decent living off it? Some of you people are so blind and just plan fucking retarded!Only an hour? I feel cheated in some wayMedicare for all. No bs middle ground incrementalism! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m38s">35:38</a> 🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼A millionaire socialist.... Define hypocrisy. This man laments the one percent while happily occupying that position. This is more satirical than SNL. Way to go, Joe.Here come the “tRuMp 2020”I don&#39;t understand the idea behind banning one type of gun but not another. A mini 14 fires the same round as an AR 15 and can be used in a mass shooting it wouldn&#39;t be classified as an assault weapon either. So banning &quot;assault&quot; style weapons will bot stop shootings It&#39;s just gonna force the crazy people to buy a different weapon. And guess what? The next bill that passes will ban all rifles. Then pistols, then shotguns, until our second amendment is non existent.Fucking communistThe minimum wage question is as it goes up as does the kiosk and self checkout stations, lost of hours.  Bernie reduced hours of his own employees, I&#39;m positive Joe is smarter than me and knows this.Dude, TRUTH BE FUCKIN TOLD BRO!!!!!

And I know you are not really a liberal, but you always ask tuff questions of both sides. What was this!? Ass kissery!Bernie already has my vote because he is giving the most free stuff. However, if another candidate, all of a sudden, offers more stuff, then I will vote for that candidate.Joe “Where are you getting your weed at?” RoganBernie, if America sucks so bad, move to Canada<b>Bernie Sanders you have ONE JOB.

Bernie - &quot;We have to give free stuff to everyone&quot;. Joe - &quot;You&#39;re so awesome Bernie!&quot;. All I heard was this lunatic spewing the same garbage talking points that he&#39;s been spewing for years without any real substance at all. No real answers. No explanations. Just his typical crap about Wall Street and big pharma, and give free shit to everyone.Oh hell yeah Joe!! My face lite up bright when I seen this link with Bernie!!!  Thank you sir!! 👏😂💯<br /><br />Dam Joe, I need another hour with this man bro!!Thank you Joe! Best interview/conversation with Bernie ever!Holy mother fuck. Bernie Sanders!What a fucking liar saying that they don’t do background checks at gun shows. Yet another lying piece of shit that probably hasn’t handled a weapon before. The ban on “assault weapons” that Bernie talks about is going to be all semi autos. This old fuck has never had a job. He’s a multi millionaire on Gov Cheese!I think its interesting that people want to cry SOCIALISM when it comes to Bernie. But what he is advocating isnt socialism. Is Germany, France, Canada, etc socialist because they have socialized healthcare? No a program or two dont make the country socialist. Are we socialist because of public schools, roads, police, fireman? No? Ok expand that reasoning to socialized medicine.Who wants to see Marianne Williamson spark up a joint with Joe on his podcast? 😂Hey Joe,  America does not lead in mass shootings or gun violence  in the worldI think Bernie has good intentions, but his policies are very dependent on the public not taking advantage of government services. There&#39;s a side of Murphy&#39;s Law that heavily applies to politics. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and anything that can be abused to taken advantage of by the public will be.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=39m10s">39:10</a> Bernie, flat out LIE!<br />The assault weapons ban was NOT undone by Republicans!<br />It expired, it was a 10 year ban which was done to find out what  effect it would have on gun crimes.  It had NO effect and therefore was allowed to expire!!Bernie, good luck on the run!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freemedicareforall">#freemedicareforall</a>I’m really struggling as a non-American how there’s people who flat out disagree with some of Bernie’s points.....Fuck Bernie !!

What about the crooked politicians who accept those bribes?<br />Is anyone falling for his bullshit?<br />Ceo&#39;s and Business men don&#39;t lie about being in it for profit.<br />The only liars are the politicians like Bernie.You need to get Daylyt on the podcast!!Bernie Sanders sounds like he belongs in the mafia🤔Bull, the corporations do NOT make the laws, they pay off congressmen and women to write laws that allow loop holes, that allow them to charge whatever they want for pharmaceuticals. I love how these politicians blame everything on the corporations, but guess what, not one of these corporations are breaking laws, and who writes the goddamn laws? Congressmen and women and the senate. As for tax cuts making more for the 1% after 10 years, well of course it will. When more people have jobs and are able to buy things, corporations make more money, much much more money. As for colleges debt, why do you think colleges charge so much? Because politicians began paying for so many people; once government is paying for something, the prices are always going to go up. The only thing I agree with Bernie on is regulating pharmaceutical companies. See, in a regular business, you can just not buy the product, you can regulate with your cash and the only cost is, you don&#39;t have a fancy new whatever you were going to buy. With healthcare, you can&#39;t do that because the cost is your life and pharmaceuticals know this. The drug prices HAVE to be regulated and ENFORCED by government because the people have zero power over them.This man is an absolute hero! All he cares about if fixing things for the people. A genuine hero.<br />And with student loans... I had zero idea wtf I was signing. No clue! He&#39;s just right about everything!How can you listen to this man and think he&#39;s a radical? Really hope this opens some right wing eyes who listen to what right wing pundits tell them Bernie stands for, rather than listening to the man himself.This guy said &quot;eliminate fossil fuels&quot;, Wind turbines have a huge motor in the nacelle area that utilizes  fossil fuels. What a joke!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=17m57s">17:57</a> - scientists like aoc?If you watch joe Rogan to get your political perspective on the world, you are a complete fucking moron.New Zealand has a lower rate for young workers, I personally know three people who have been exploited by this and each of them unknowingly took an older employees higher paying wage.Bernie, I know it was just a slip up but you really messed up your outro by saying we fought China in WW2Another guy who deserves to be in Joe Rogan show. Richard Wolff. He will explain everything in detail what Bernie said today. Keep up the good work Joe!!Tried to give him a chance to sound sensible. <br />Nope he’s a quack!Yo Jamie stop deleting my comments, you authoritarian.I did not know who bernie was until 2013.  I think that is the fault of the media.  Who are our progressive representatives?Now he needs to get on that <i>hitta</i> podcast gang GANGProbably the best Bernie interview i&#39;ve seen this campaign so far. Good one, Rogan. More candidates should be on your show.Damn.   Great interview !!!  Well done Joe Hogan.    Bernie not a monster , however some of his statistics are off and completely off base in my opinion on numerous topics.    When ever your campaign revolves around FREE goods and services , your trying to steal votes from weak minded people.   If it’s too good to be true , it’s too good to be true.Definitely one of the best episodes. Still, 1 hours doesn&#39;t feel like long enoughJoe. They took down Kamala&#39;s records after the debate......Also she was obviously stunned into silence. She could&#39;ve responded if she wanted to face to face. All Kamala did was run to cnn and attack Tulsi over a meeting; with Assad, that was aimed at brokering peace. She can&#39;t handle face to face battle&#39;s, only false perceptions pushed by msm. Just as every other status quo dem that&#39;s the &#39;leading candidate&#39;.I think America actually does do a good job of having productive discussions... Thanks to Joe Rogan.Does his shoes have shoe laces? I need to know thanks.Sad part is Bernie actually thinks he brought up a good case! what a ignorant liberal socialist moron😂My boy Bernie Sanders on the Joe Rogan Show WOW this is unprecedented Lol 👍🏽😂😂😂I&#39;m just here to say fuck Bernie Sanders. Nothing more than a political whore who will never be elected president. No sides between red and blue, but fuck him personally. That weasel.A few things that adults should stop believing in are Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, Bernie Sanders, and the Boogeyman.22 trillion in debt.Just a few things here!<br />1. He referenced canada as being the model for healthcare but what he doesn&#39;t tell you is that when the government controls healthcare, the government decides who lives and dies! Canadians don&#39;t even like their healthcare system!<br />2. He said Republicans dismantled the assault weapons ban, that ban had sunset clause that stated that the ban would end in 10 years if there was no proof that it reduced gun violence! There was no proof so the ban went away!<br />3. He spends an awful lot of time hating on rich people for someone who is a millionaire and owns several vacation homes!<br />4. He referenced Baltimore and Chicago as cities that need to be fixed and they absolutely do need fixing but he fails to mention that they have been under Democrat leadership for as long as anyone can remember! California has been a blue state since the dinosaurs went extinct and they literally have people living in third world conditions!<br />5. He makes it sound like anyone who doesn&#39;t get college degree is doomed to minimum wage for the rest of their life! I have an 8th grade education and make more money than the vast majority of people my age who went to college! We don&#39;t have an education crisis we have a crisis of lazy entitled brats! <br />6. He preaches 15 dollars an hour but it turns out his own staff wasn&#39;t even making that, then when it was discovered, he started paying 15 an hour but he cut hours so they don&#39;t get any overtime!All I hear is outcry of corruption but real no solutions. He&#39;s right about alot of things but I am just not sure where the lines is between hard work and personal reposibility and how much the systems cause our problems. I was broke, jobless, in dept and stress out to the max. Could not survive on min wage, so I learn to drive a big rig, got out debt and have a career making 60k a year boughta house and thinking of going back to school.  <br /><br />I am not success story but iam comfortable.  if I was in a third world country on would to pull my self out of the pit in my life.<br /><br />What I&#39;m trying to say is tearing the world apart easy but salus it out with all the good capitalism has provided. It&#39;s brought more people out of poverty than any other system. I just wish for a balanced president. A purple party<br /> <br />.Lost me at the guns BernieThere are people who will watch this and still say Trump is our best chance to further the nation to a better path. Bernie gives you a deep answer to a question, going at the roots of these problems. <br /><br />I will never understand people who can’t pay their bills voting in favor for the rich getting richer. Somehow it’s the person fault with less than you that you don’t have more? Couldn’t be the guy eating all the food that leaves you starving. It’s the guy who picked up your crumbs. Incredible. <br /><br />Great interview!I dont agree with bernie sanders on much but im glad i listened to him for an hour and understand his position betterBernie Sanders - the wealthy politicians get too many breaks...<br />also Bernie Sanders -  Presidential Candidates should get as much free network airtime as they see fit to explain their case regarding complex issues in their platform.<br /><br /><br />I don&#39;t think a man ever had more fitting initials... BS“I am going to force networks to give airtime to all candidates.”  “I do not want a dictatorship.”Nah, fuck you, and fuck this commie piece of shit.  Lost me bro.Why would you give these retard a platformAnyone else get ASMR from Bernie????banning a tool isnt going to stop illegal tools from being made and sold. thats how easy the gun debate is. carry, be prepared, thats all we can do.From Vermont. 👎👎 <br />Don’t be fooled by this guy, it’s the same story just a different old man.&quot;We&#39;ll announce it on this show!&quot;Hmmmm..... Isn&#39;t he the same guy that said &quot;white people dont know what its like to be poor&quot;?HAVE FUN NOW!NOTHING IS FREE.This was a poor performance from Bernie. Couldn’t provide a single concrete response of what he would actually DO to tackle the problems he mentioned for the last hour.Rich vs everyone elsei cant wait for the remixYessss!!! Finally! Bernie 2020!You need to have Donald Trump on not this scum bag communistHe won&#39;t be able to do anything because he is owned by the ClintonsNo fucking way!!!!!! Bern with Joe!! God this is a epic channel. This gets my vote for Bernie. No fake news here...... only punctual answers!!!!Bernie sounds like he is saying “ magic lances “. Can some one photo shop Bernie jousting with a unicorn horn.Bernie “assualt weapons” Sanders 😒I&#39;m just here for the salty ass Republicans.I really hope Bernie can make it this time 🤞Bernie &quot;I don&#39;t have the numbers in front of me&quot; SandersAmericans paying 10x more for diabetic medication?<br />Why? <br />Think about it? <br />High obesity = High demand = High profit. <br />Both the food industry and pharmaceutical are equally responsible for this terrible cycle of misery.Bernie 2020 joe you consistently do incredible work  thank you for this.YangThe reason we let people bank off shore is because we can’t make them pay taxes.I want to thumb it down cause of Bernie... But I&#39;m glad he actually went on the show!Health care health care health care.. is that the only agenda you have to be top leader?!Loans are also part of the reason.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BERNIE2020">#BERNIE2020</a>Bernie Sanders lowering the voice like a hardcore Jewish Hitman......Just started this, but of course Joe starts with some weak breaking the 4th wall meta bs on debates. Read the paper. Don’t sit here and lead Bernie Sanders away from the issue. Jesus. Ok, hope this gets on track!Where&#39;s Ron Paul in 2020?  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also, Jordan Peterson.  Since I&#39;m Canadian.Raising minimum wage will cause people to lose their jobs and hours. It&#39;s happening now. Also places like McDonald&#39;s now have tough screens to order food which cut down employment and hours. Idiotic idea if you actually think about the effect it will and does haveBernie is a hero of the people. A true working class leader. We&#39;ve been waiting for you Bernie!270 mass shooting in a year? Maybe in the history of America. Or the last 100 years... There was not a mass shooting almost everyday of the year.  but great video. thanks for sharing.You mean Corp democratsJoe rogan for president 2024Smart move by Bernie in doing this.  Joe Rogan is taking more risk than Sanders on this show.  I am glad this is happening and I hope more politicians on both sides go on shows like this.electric cars for 30$ then can afford🤦‍♂️Bernie Sanders = A Commie and not gonna win 2020 because US Electoral College do not select a bald president.From a Frenchman&#39;s perspective, your healthcare system has always been a joke to us and so are your tuition fees.Bernie Sanders/Joe Rogan 2020So I&#39;m going to school to become a doctor.  I know its going to be 8 years of school around 30k/yr which is 240k when I&#39;m done.  But I know that after I graduate, I&#39;ll be making 150k /yr.  I took a risk and now its paying off.  How is this immoral?  College should be cheap but not free!The thing is you don&#39;t need a college education to make a living. I&#39;m from an area with a low cost of living and shit you can make $19 an hour at nearly any manufacturing plant (if you can work hard and have any common sense) with just a GED. Work 50 hours and your making $1000 a week.I&#39;d love to see Trump bodyslam Bernie WWF style at the presidential debates. Fingers crossed.Joe should&#39;ve invited Joey Diaz to join the conversationQuality of care in Canada doesn&#39;t matter if you have to wait insane amounts of timeWhen Joe ask how Bernie would stop the drug companies from having so much influence Bernie had no answer.  That is stupifying and disqualifying.You kind of softballed him Joe. Even Patton Aswalt would have asked tougher questions.Feeling the Bern!!&quot;Thanks Ugly God&quot; 😁😆😃😄yugeA wonderful interview that nails a lot that can be done to improve a good number of relevant issues.<br /><br />Whether you support Bernie or not, his suggestions should not be ignored.Fuck you bernie. Anti second ammendment and anti america. You&#39;re at least ten times more likely to die from a doctor committing malpractice in hospital than a gun and he doesn&#39;t say shit. This isnt about saving lives. Hes a liar and a shill. Over a million people die every year driving because we make it so easy to get a license. Fuck off and you dont give a fuck about the childrenBernie: “These are issues we have to deal with and I will deal with.”<br /><br />Me: “How?”<br /><br />Bernie: “I’ll deal with it.”Holy shit what a pull, this is definitely how I’d prefer to hear from candidates. That being said, Bernie was doing some really creative framing for some of these topics , but he came off much more personable than he normally does.I&#39;m thinking Bernie didn&#39;t support full scale drug legalization so he didn&#39;t hurt his reputation. I&#39;m hoping he&#39;s smart enough to see the side Joe is defending.&quot;shall not be infringed&quot;Trade your freedom as a person for free stuff... .. .Rich people made the laws.. but you guys in the gov pass them.. gtfo...This is what real Presidential material looks like. Go get em Bernie.Healthcare, pharmaceuticals, college debt and aliensFuck you bernie. Anti second ammendment and anti america. You&#39;re at least ten times more likely to die from a doctor committing malpractice in hospital than a gun and he doesn&#39;t say shit. This isnt about saving lives. Hes a liar and a shill. Over a million people die every year driving because we make it so easy to get a license. Fuck off and you dont give a fuck about the childrenJoe you are next level man! LOVE what you are doingYang, Tulsi, now Sanders... Maybe Joe should just interview all of the dem candidates.  It tells you more about the candidates then the stupid debates do.Love it, Bernie keeps on bringing the fire. Hope people listened.I cannot be the only one immediately imaging Trump on the podcast while watching this. Would not surprise me one bit at this point.All the anti Bernie comments getting pushed to the bottomJRE should host the debates in a cell games tournament wayThis is really cool. Not a Bernie fan whatsoever. However I’m glad he’s on this podcast. Conversations only happen if you let them. JRE could/should have political debates on here whenever cable becomes obsolete.Ok. Glad that happened. Where’s the question about automation? Self driving trucks and so on? <br />Millions of people out of work in years to come.Productive conversation. Now have another podcast with Bernie and have someone like Ben Shapiro on to challenge him.Pathetic old commie and an aging fool (who should stick to weed and UFC) discuss policy. I couldn&#39;t make it pay 5 minutes without vomiting.Bernie is side stepping the cost factor of providing universal healthcare. You’re a dupe if you actually believe your health care options would better under the plan from the Democrats. Even the poor will suffer from their plan. <br />Under “Medicare for all” &amp; “single payer healthcare” say goodby to medical innovation. Say hello to long wait periods for treatment, high costs for private care, &amp; extreme shortages for public options. <br />I think I’ll stick with my blue cross, blue shield coverage.I would love to hear what any Presidential candidate has to say about climate change and AI coming on .Whats the use of 15$ per hour if a machine takes their place -very important !!!Let truckers smoke marijuana!! Please Bernie! Make it federally legal. Before I lose my marbles!!Communist—&gt;Socialist—&gt;Democratic Socialist—&gt;Ninja CommunistBernie 2020!!!!Lol, bc the DNC gives people fair shots, right Bernie?!? 😂🤣Drugs are tools and tools should be made in top of the line production facilities by skilled, ethical and regulated people.  Combine the taxes raised with the dollars saved through lesser state medical costs and zero legal costs to the state and you&#39;re either an idiot who loves paying more taxes or on the board of a pharmaceutical company if you still think criminalising drugs is a good idea.  Legalise ALL drugs and the likelihood of mitigating Americas problems will increase vastlyRogan seemed guarded. I think he was worried Bernie was going to die from this cough.they need to start discussing term limits, somebody like bernie sanders shouldnt exist. Our leaders need to start bringing more to the table then just middle manning stuff. Nothing will change politics wise unless the &quot;career politician&quot; type people go away.Hey uncle Bernie!? How many people in this country were living in despair when we didn&#39;t have the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment in the history of this country? Oh yeah millions more! How sad to have to run on how terrible life in your country is. To have to deny the most progress in this country since President Reagan. That&#39;s why our President will win in a landslide. He loves and is optimistic about this great country. There is a reason everyone on the planet is dying to get here. And aside fro LA and NY the people in this country love America and want her to thrive. You go run on how bad and dirty she is. This country was founded on the blood of Patriots and it will be saved by Patriots! Fuck off Burns!Didn&#39;t say how high he needs to raise taxes. You won&#39;t like him then.Ar 15s arent assault weapons. Semi automatic. Gun control wont work.. armed guards at school would 100% stop school shootings... I agree with a lot of Saunders stuff but not banning gunsDon’t trust anyone who combs their hair with a balloon!This is entertaining even if I disagree with Bernie in nearly all ways. LikedHealthcare in Canada is free but it is not great by any means. The care my brother in law received in Toronto and Kingston hospitals in Ontario was so horrible he chose assisted suicide at the age of 27 because of the terrible care he received. He was paralyzed from the neck down and suffered from bad bed sores and infection because he was not properly cleaned or rotated and his own mother had to do these things for him most of the time to make sure they were done with any proficiency.Strong licensing procedure for &quot;assault weapons&quot; already in circulation. In other words only the rich will have them. That seems weird coming from Bernie. Also buying 12 guns with the intent of reselling them is already illegal.  It&#39;s called a straw purchase.alex jonea shoudve been on with em they know eachother already from the airport lolI would have died if Alex Jones walked in 💀😂😂😂Holy fuck dudeBernie and Warren are the only ones running in the last DECADE that WALK THE WALK... every. fucking. day... no matter what.<br /><br /><br />We deserve Trump if we can&#39;t put fighters in that office.Did Bernie ever take a single economics class? The guy is scary dumbHows that 15$ minimum wage going in NY there Bernie you idiotBernie Sanders 2020!! Love you joe for having him!!!I love when Bernie said:🤡🤡🤡🤡To all the folks that hate on Joe Rogan... Pareto principleWelp, there goes an hour of my sleep tonight. Gotta open up the shop early. Shouldn’t have peaked at my  YouTube app before bed. God I love Joe Rogan podcasts. Sometimes I dream that I’m being interviewed and I have this cool back story. With all this interesting shit to say. Nah, I’m just a dude who works a lot and beats his meat too much.DID joe rogan ask bernie sander&#39;s the Question every body wants to hear??? on why he walked away when ALEX JONE&#39;S was in his Face !!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=42m35s">42:35</a> Joe explains to him the facts and the real problem with these mass shootings in our country...Bernie changed the subject to another “this is unbelievable, but I’ll never forget it, some young woman came up to me and said...” what does this have to do with gun violence? “Move beyond gun violence and let’s talk about free insurance!” 🤔I&#39;m not a fan of Socialised heath care , but I was feeling what he had to say. But as soon as he said &quot;living wage&quot; I knew he was full of shit from then on out.Getting raped in the anus by drug and insurance companies is as American as apple pie, fucking commies.Joe Rogan has changed, besides having mostly right wingers on his pod cast, he wasn&#39;t being the usual Rogan that gives his opinions on things. He was acting as neutral, and saying other are saying this, how do you convince them?. It almost seemed to me as he doesn&#39;t want to be seen agreeing with Bernie so much. Anyhow glad he finally brought Bernie to the show7.29.. not sure if I&#39;ll watch more, likely will.. but, when he&#39;s not looking at you directly.. he is directing directly to the masses. And that, is when he looses validity. He isn&#39;t like  a person truly having an open conversation with you as many have and as many have generally faked. He deludes himself to near absolution instead of right now realism. Fuck that.. no matter What it seems to promote.We need someone like Bernie to lead us, he will destroy whats left of the US... Communism will end our country, but at least it will give us a chance to start fresh with a very valuable lesson... Just sucks its gonna take so long to kindle a spark for libertarianism... .. .Anyone who can listen to the words of Bernie Sanders and not understand he is the genuine article is completely hoodwinked.Wow - minimum wage in Canada in my province is 12.05 and hour, <br />Blows my mind hearing in the states you only get 7.75You know what, that’s all I care about rn is healthcare. Let’s get Bernie the nomination this timeYou never cease to amaze me, you awesome sumbitch!Haven’t started yet, can’t wait for Joe to offer Bernie some DMTNot getting my voteBernie... you messed up. Had you realized that you could have spent 2-3+ hrs articulating your plans in detail instead of only 1 hour, you might have reached more of Joe&#39;s &quot;6 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS !!!!&quot;An hour is all a sane person need to realize that Bernie Sanders should be the next President.&quot;DNC is in a difficult postion.  They have 20 c plus candidates and they want to give everybody a fair shot...&quot;    <br /><br />Yeah candidates like Andrew Yang have been given a real fair shot, Bernie!  Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuulllllllllshit!  Not that Im a Yang fan, but the debates have been anything but fair and don&#39;t get me started on the garbage questioning.  Yeah, the DNC is in a difficult position....Of screwing up 2020!Joe is bringing in the paradigm shift. The revolution is here!I&#39;ve never read comments with the newest first. This is the funniest shit ever. Conservatives collapsing out her.He can&#39;t be President because of the way he sits in his chair - Presidents don&#39;t sit like that - they sit up straight - SIMPLEMy President$15 would have been acceptable 13 years ago to keep up with real inflation not what the govt.(oligarchy) says it is which is horse shiX just like the unemployment rate.  $22 is necessary if you want people today to have a min. wage like people had in the 70&#39;s.  Sucks that the boomers had the #&#39;s so they were given a decent system to work within but then they built this dystopian nightmare &amp; now tell younger people they should be slaves for a few years.Tulsi 2020Now go on Jimmy Dore!Bernie Sanders is actually the real deal, the rest of you can fuck offTrump 2020I am surprised by this unexpected yet delightful podcastJoe 1 Hour? You should&#39;ve locked the doors..&quot;I don&#39;t have magical answers.&quot; You don&#39;t have any answers. You have platitudes and promises but no real plans. You&#39;re like an ancient baby pointing to things you don&#39;t like and saying ewww yucky.trump is the only one calling out those cities boltimore detroit chicago.  theyre all ran by democratsBERNIE IS ONE OF THE BRAVEST MEN ALIVE.  THANK YOU FOR LIGHTING THE FIRE.It&#39;s cool hearing him in a rare relaxed long form setting. He comes off way more soft spoken then I thought.Good thumb. Did exactly what the masters told him. Who&#39;s your master Rogan!So good to actually hear politicians talk about what&#39;s important, ISSUES, and in depth. Nice break from the bullshit you see on main stream media, well done Joe Hogan.Curb your future president...Gawd dang it Joe, you didn’t ask if he’d done/do dmtwait, WHAT? BERNIE on JOE ROGAN? WHAT IS LIFEWow 😮 wow is all i can say the things bernie is saying is exactly what this country need!!! I hope he does get elected amd i hope he sticks to his word.. unfortunately in this country one man cannot do it. It takes for everyone up there to get it done but we have souless corrupt heartless heathens who will fight an kill to make it difficult... i fkn hate them pieces of fkn shit the rich literally rape an shit all over all of us normal ppl... i wish are ppl would wake the fuk up an realize wtf is really going on an we could come together an really make a changeBernie... I support the 2nd amendment. ..but... Any time I support is followed by but, you don&#39;t support it. Also banning existing Modern sporting rifles, we want to do what New Zealand did??? A mandatory buy back on weapons is what you want to do in the US?? NO WAY BERNIE!  Also NZ has over a million guns and they have managed to get 700 back. Do you actually think Americans will turn in 100s of millions of guns? That would put a major division in this country, every democratic voter I know who owns a gun, lives in the city. Most have stopped voting Democrat because of gun control.Holy Bananas!!!<br />Joe &quot;My Hero&quot; RoganI don&#39;t trust Bernie Sanders because he doesn&#39;t stand up to the MIC and his foreign policy wouldn&#39;t be much different than any other puppet in office.BERNIE IS THE MAN!!!!! BE OUR PRESIDENTThis should’ve been several hours. Hope Bernie returns to this podcast!Bernie is one of the only politicians that give a shit about the well being of the american people.If student loan debt should be magically forgiven, why not mortgage debt?  Credit card debt? etcThis would&#39;ve been perfect if they discussed freedom of speech, identity politics, equality of opportunity vs. equality of income, etc.Omfg Bernie on RJ!Woa, what is happening.&gt;complains about the 1%<br />&gt;owns three homes, and is worth millionsAll you have to do is lower taxes.  period.  That would help the most.  But they never do.  America went downhill since 2001.  Can&#39;t say otherwise. $7.25 best describes where we are at.Orange man badIT&#39;S NOT FREE YOU JUST PAY HIGHER TAXES FOR IT.Can&#39;t wait for Bernie Sanders to come back on JRE as the President and announce UFOs and Aliens disclosure.This guy is lips moving, air coming out, no plan. He would ruin us all. Socialism is all talk with millions of graves to show its triumphant end.key phrase &quot;other countries....&quot;<br /><br />Really think about that<br />Thats them not usIt would&#39;ve been funny if the BLM gals showed up and shut it Down!!You should have asked him who taught him to add.. Fuck you bernie. Anti second ammendment and anti america. You&#39;re at least ten times more likely to die from a doctor committing malpractice in hospital than a gun and he diesnt say shit. This isnt about saving lives. Hes a liar and a shill. Over a million people day every year driving because we make it so easy to get a license. Fuck off and you dont give a fuck about the childrenBernie is what Trump supporters wanted Trump to be, he is transparent and says it like it is without BS&#39;ing you. Capitalism has been destroying the average person, if you&#39;re a working day average Joe you cannot say with a straight face we are richer now than before, people are working two to 3 jobs to make ends meet and even that&#39;s not enough sometimes. Shit has to change man.Why didn&#39;t you mention the damn 1994 assault weapons ban that was proven to not reduce gun crime? Damnit joe.Hey Mr. Rogan <br />You should host long form debates between the candidates.Before I watch this... as a citizen of another &quot;new&quot; state... I feel like I have to &quot;out&quot; Beau of the Fifth Column.... sorry in advance Beau!!!Bernie should be the current president. 20/20 hopeful! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FeelTheBern">#FeelTheBern</a>It seems like UBI would be so much better for small business than raising the minimum wage.

This is why we need right, middle and center candidates on all platforms.Why would I want my country to be like all other countries?

It&#39;s no wonder many consider you a shill..Bernie sanders has my vote. Who agrees? 🇺🇸bring this beautiful country back to what it should be.Hearing Bernie speak reminds me of George Carlin’s skit on soft language. Guy is self righteous as hell...I think his heart is in the right place but you can only hide away from reality for so long.Can someone please make a gif of Bernie nodding his head at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m54s">24:54</a> mark and tag me??Bernie has never heard of the Pareto Distribution.thanks for getting in the question about aliens at the end, that&#39;s an issue candidates are never asked aboutIt’s nice to have Bernie on &amp; all, but he was ALL OVER the place. He’s slick.... Healthcare will &amp; always will be a privilege &amp; NOT a right! We can do things to help everyone get it, but it is not a right! Canceling student loan debt is freaking ridiculous! Cancel the interest on ANY of the loans, but canceling the debt shows there is no repercussions for you getting yourself into that situation! Nobody’s canceling my debt I owe.... we have to be resonable on these things &amp; people must be accountable for their actions! The weapon issue, I won’t even begin to get into...... I will say, if you don’t want law biding Americans to be able to buy these weapons, 1st.... stop selling them to terrorist country’s (Saudi Arabia &amp; such) to begin with, then maybe we can talk! But we know that won’t happen... so Nah bruh....I urge everyone to do your own research about the shit he&#39;s saying about buying weapons. Not all is true, some of it is lies some of it is based on half truths.Andrew yang !!!!!Socialism here we comeHealth care is not a human right. You&#39;re out in the woods hiking by yourself and you break your leg. Where&#39;s you right to care in that situation? Even if someone comes hiking down the same trail as you and finds you; you can&#39;t force them to help you. It&#39;s a decent thing to do to help someone but it is definitely not a human rightI would pay to watch a debate between Bernie and TrumpThank you Joe Rogan 🤙🏻THEY LEFT THE MIC&#39;S RUNNING THEIR&#39;S RECORDINGS THAT WE DIDN&quot;T HEAR YET , OF ALL THIS SHIT!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!I&#39;m not all the way through this but if you believe in the Second Amendment then you should be asking him how we are going to protect our freedom of speech without having high powered weapons freedom of speech is so underrated but people don&#39;t realize that is our freedom and you can&#39;t defend yourself against the government not criminals but the government with a handgun or a small powered weapon so g f o h with that trying to minimalize and soften all of your ideas by saying that&#39;s not so bad all I&#39;m trying to do is... followed by I love the Second Amendment??If a business can not afford to pay their employees 3 dollars more an hour (depending on where you live), then they shouldn&#39;t be open in the first place! IMOYous a fool if you think tRump would come on this (or any) remotely &quot;real&quot; show.Dude get trumpPlease get Trump on!@PowerfulJRE get buffet on thisThis is how it all should be, give time whoever you are your chance to at least explain what you want to do, now I don&#39;t support Bernie but he&#39;s at least given a chance to explain himselfBernie is a pos!Won&#39;t lie I kinda like him as a person. Great guy.FEEL THE BERNThe reason is not money in politics. The reason is government is involved in healthcare.Lol he didn’t miss beat when he accidentally said we went to war with china in World War Two  I get it japans close lmfao idk if I trust him but I did like to hear him in this formImagine Donald Trump on Joe RoganShalommmmmmmm jew Rogan and rabbi sanders, it&#39;s a gevald nobody wants to pay for womens abortions in america like we are forced to here in jew occupied england, please send 500 million more Pakistanis for diversity and wiping white people out, it&#39;s a mitzvah.The only good politicians are going on JRE. I hope I don&#39;t see a Kamala Harris or Petey B on next after they see a trend.Hmmmmm...how much was Joe paid to have Bernie on the show....Bernie &quot;Tax will fix everything&quot; Sanders. What A FoolCrazy, socialist Bernie.  Sorry, dude, but you&#39;ll never win because America will never be a socialist country.  Plus, you are old AF.The first podcast of Rogans ever  that I could give two flying fucks about. Fkn delusional insane full of shit old man. These Dems are so out of their mind&#39;s it&#39;s just comical at this point.Leave it to Joe &quot;nobody owns me&quot; Rogan to have Bernie on and give him the opportunity to be a regular Joe!!I forgot a grip of liberal pussyfags started listening for aomereason and they actually believe the horseshit this man vomits out his mouth.. Bernies old ass will NEVER be president.. someone will make sure of that..No questions on automation or artificial intelligence when that took more jobs that outsourcing.Fuckin shit man it was all going fine until he started talking about guns Bernie is an idiot about gunsI applaud Joe Rogan for giving this show to us.  I am a critical fan of Joe Rogan who will criticize Joe Rogan if I see fit.  This time I am very pleased and thankful for this showEvery candidate needs to do his show.....Why didn’t you ask him why he let Hillary Fuk him over???Softball bitch!RIP Mainstream mediaIt’s not a right as others would have to pay for you to get care, work for you to give you care, etc this has to be forced by the govt. I’m in Canada it’s horrific I had to go to the states recently. Private biz has the incentives to get you in quickly with no rationing or lack of resources like here, Bernie resents success while he has millions and multiple homes but he won’t even pay his own staff min wage lol.Great show. Thanks @joerogan for always giving us the best shit &amp; making us cannabis users not seem like drug addicts!Seen the shit show that is VA health care??? Let’s get rid of your private healthcare and replace it with that. How’s that sound?Whether you&#39;re voting for Bernie or not , a podcast gets deep in the issues . You can&#39;t fake it on a 1 hour long podcast . Every candidate needs to be on here .This guy thinks he can push me around!Bernie 2020!!My granddaughter told me when she started high school her and her friends looked for places to hide.Honeslty I like the guy. I just wish he wasn&#39;t so damn set against the right to bear arms. That so called &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban doesn&#39;t flyWow Bernie committed suicide with this whole podcast<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m46s">0:46</a> youtube time stamps without context. Joe &quot;lets pull this thing&quot; RoganBernie is Americas only hope to take back what the rich and elites have taken from the everyday common American our rights!Hey Bernie!!  you going to ban vehicls, knives, pipes ,aroplanes and everything else that can be used as a weapon to kill multible people in one outing?   you fucking idiot!!   and NO- you don&#39;t believe in the 2nd Amendment or you wouldn&#39;t be talking the shit your talking.Bernie and Tulsi 2020 🔥Now have Trump on a prove you&#39;re not a thumb.Joe Rogan is more honest than ANY MAINSTREAM MEDIA PUNDIT.Bernie Sanders 2020This was really great.Bernie is a filthy communist Jew.  I hope we gas him.Not one question about size of government or debt. OR the scandal surrounding Bernie&#39;s wife. I will give him credit though, to those only thinking with emotion, his ideas make a lot of sense. Problem is government and tax dollars cant fix everything! This country is broke! Not just financially but also culturally :(Goofy Bernie Sanders at it again. hed be a better candidate than creepy pedo joe at least.at first glance i read &quot;BARRY Sanders&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I was quite surprised but not let down hahaJoe should have the dems dabate on his show.He said more of actual meaning and significance in this hour than Trump has in his entire presidency.I got 12 min in....its just too damn boring for me. Rich get richer, poor get poorer...I got it.MAGA 2020Bernie: &quot;I have 7 grandchildren.&quot; <br /><br /><br />Joe: *Fights back &quot;Hollaaa&quot;No fuckin way!! hahaGood show, if i were a democrat i would vote for bernie, hes actually pretty conservative and logicalLarry David&#39;s final evolution.He copied what Yang said on his closing statement within 30 seconds of starting the videoTrump 2020I was listening thinking this was a podcast from 2016, holy shit was i was wrongGet Ron Paul on here to refute all this nonsense.Lol Bernie is crazier than I thoughtThere was no trauma when children were hiding under desks during the Cold War.Just a few questions I&#39;m wondering about. He mentioned taxing wallstreet to come up with 2.2 trillion dollars to pay off student debt, but that doesnt include the costs of making education free. How much would that cost and how do we pay for it? <br /><br />Also, like he mentioned, cant the government regulate price gauging by pharmaceutical companies? Why is necessary to eliminate the private sector of health insurance and have the industry completely controlled by the government? <br /><br />Also, 12 years or else we will cause irreversible damage to the earth? He certainly left the impression of &quot;doom&quot; which seems like fear mongering of the highest level. <br /><br />He loves the 2nd ammendment but wants to completely  ban all assault rifles? Interesting lol<br /><br />Basically it seems like he wants the government to have complete control of everything and all of the power. A.k.a socialism.Climate change is propaganda for people control and job elimination.berniiiieeee 🎉💕Bernie needs to win the Presidency  or nothing positve will change for any of us.A living wage drives up the cost of basic goods/services for everyone.  -  The more we artificially inflate the cost of labor the more attractive automation becomes.  -  Entry-level workers cannot bargain for a job, they cannot lower their price to get a job unless they work off the books resulting in a large black market for illegal labor.Wow that&#39;s pretty cool! The other day I thought about how awesome it would be to have Bernie Sanders on Joe Rogan podcast. Nicely done!I got a trump ad on this lolWhat happens when you have wealth and income inequality? You end up with a substantial amount of people who are dispossessed. What happens when those dispossessed people get fed up with the status quo? They lash out, not unlike those people who have been committing these atrocities that we see at an increasing rate each year. Wake the fuck up, because it’s not coincidence.You better believe I&#39;m sharing this podcast!Trump is next on the JREHey it&#39;s one the old guys from the Muppet show....No teleprompter, and not once did he call it Taledo.  Imagine having a president who can put a thought together.Bro....... trump on JRE..... the public couldn’t handle the big dick energy in that room, Jaimes Adam’s apple would grow to a baseball after that episod that’s how much man test was pumpin in that room UGGGGHHHH YEEEEEEAAAAAAQuality of healthcare is not better in other nations. If you adjust for the fact that the us is a more dangerous country ( gun deaths, car deaths) we have the highest life expectancy which is a result of our healthcare systemHoly shit! So happy to see Bernie on Joe Rogan ❤️Marianne Williamson needs to be on your show!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23marianne2020">#marianne2020</a>Way to ask the hard questions, Joe!  Seriously though, you&#39;ve got some stuff on your mouth, from sucking his D so much!THE MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES !!! this fucking socialist lmaoI thought that I just read that Trump is making it legal for Americans to buy Canadian pharmaceuticals.Bernie taking Yangs point on debate it’s a reality tv show! Haha!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PowerfulBernieSanders">#PowerfulBernieSanders</a>Want to know a major cause of depression and suicide among men? The extreme drop in testosterone over the last 30 years. No one talks about it. No one really studies it. TRT is marketed almost exclusively to guys with ED and low sex drive. The second tier is based on vanity, building muscle. Where are the psychiatrists ordering blood tests and prescribing TRT instead of SSRIs that make many have suicidal thoughts and the professionals don&#39;t know how they even work.Just started watching the video and just want to note that Bernie&#39;s politics, economics &amp; philosophy are between 95 &amp; 99% complete trash and will be extremely destructive. I&#39;ll come back and edit if I hear anything new that I can tolerate.He is looking really rough. :/ hope he holds up through the campaign. I&#39;m really anti sanders but the man is honest and consistent, so it would be a shame to have him go down.Piece of shit been in politics how many years but blames everything on everyone else.My least favorite candidate by far... this is going to be an interesting podcast, can&#39;t wait to really hear what this guy has to say in more than a few minutes at a time1 hour? Even Sargon was able to talk about his concerns for 3...Tulsi wasn&#39;t asking Kamala those questions, she was telling us how disgusting Harris is.  Everything Tulsi said about her is TRUE.  Harris is RUTHLESS and SOULESSExcellent! Thank you Joe and Thank you Bernie Sanders! Very informative!Here&#39;s a radical idea Bernie: Nobody has a inalienable right to something that requires the labor of someone else.Joe Rogan pulled that sucker up to his face.Climate change will and does happen naturally with or without human beings.Who could possibly stand to listen to Old Man Bernie&#39;s voice for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m41s">1:07:41</a>?  Bernie it&#39;s over for you...you have never done anything for &quot;we the people&quot; in your entire career...so shut up already. Donald Trump is 100% for America and (in his short time) he has made you, and all of you lifelong politicians, look like the snakes you are......TRUMP 2020 USA USA USA!!!All candidate go on joe rogan podcast and let joe decide who gets to be a next presidentFor the love of God, Joe, please don’t just talk about weed, psychedelics, aliens, and monkeys.I’m glad he is calling out big pharma. Similar to big oil, guns, food, drink company’s. <br />“A patient cured is a customer lost”JR made a great point to say that entry level jobs were meant for KIDS just starting out in the job market... and Bernie&#39;s response is most of those people AREN&#39;T KIDS, but people raising their families... so Bernie&#39;s solutions is RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE!!!??! 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ the minimum wage IS NOT THE ISSUE... it&#39;s the goh-rammin education and skill-set these people lack!!! 😒😒😒MILLIONAIRES and BILLIONAIRES!!!... BUBUBUBUB....Where&#39;s my early bird special? <br />This man has NO shot. <br />Damn Commy.Do I wanna watch this????What the fuck is an Agender? Is that a new gender pronoun? Fuck this old faggotMade it through 23 minutes of socialist drivel.What a fucking joke! I&#39;m glad you had him on so  I could see him wilt under a long form conversation.I wish I had confidence that the people listening knew enough about history to know how much like Hitler Berny soundsSuch good topics covered on here, although an hour isn&#39;t enough to cover everything, it&#39;s much better than explaining why you want to be president in under 60 seconds on network television <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Feelthebern">#Feelthebern</a>Joe &quot; fu kin &quot; Rogan for the next presidential candidate, seriously tho. The world would be a better place if Joe ran shitI wish the media would ask thoughtful good faith questions like this to Bernie and allow for a thoughtful response.Please get more candidates to come on.  I may not agree but Bernie comes off much better on this format than a debate stage.<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m33s">1:04:33</a></b><b> 1941, War with China? 😖</b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FeelTheBern">#FeelTheBern</a>Yeah, so, more government control. I am going to pay for more government control with your money. But it&#39;s for the children so it&#39;s ok. No thank you bernie<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=14m15s">14:15</a> your tax dollars oops our tax dollars what a POSBernie is a flat dumbassWhat’s the wait times for medical care Bernie? Just asking for a friend.Incredible job by Joe. Really really good interviewer.I miss Andrew Yang, please interview him again.Right out of the box - we need to legislate television stations to air long form interviews with Presidential candidates. Authoritarian anyone?Good chat, very interestingThe truth is you need aspects of socialism and capitalism in a largely homogeneous society with closed borders and strict immigration policies. If we had that I would vote for Bernie every time.I voted Republican for 20 years UNTIL Trump. Y&#39;all republicans in 2016 and now 2020 are beyond brainwashed.Go Bernie!THANK YOU JOE AND BERNIEBernie is a Blazer..😂😂😂😂Wow, quoting Andrew Yang right out of the gate!If he wasn’t such a liar and a shyster I might actually like him to talking Brooklyn salesmanJRE is now more powerful than any broadcast or cable media channel.Joe, get Yang back on here ASAP.Bernie says that the reason prescription drug price are so high in the USA is because &quot;We [the government] are not negotiating with the drug companies&quot; which is true; however he neglected to say that it is written into the medicaid/medicare bill that the gov&#39;t can&#39;t negotiate for prices on prescription drugs and must pay full market price. So, in other words, government&#39;s involvement in providing healthcare has increased the cost of healthcare, just like ACA caused health insurance to go up. HE actually wants us to believe that the more government is the solutions to the problems the government created; but this is absurd, contradictory &amp; inherently illogical, so he has to misdirect you with part of the information to fool people, who then buy his book, because that&#39;s not capitalism? ....? yep....doesn&#39;t make sense to me either...Bernie is my Rick GrimesYANG GANG!!!Well, chump. You did it. You finally got Bernie on your podcast.Bernie makes some good points but didn’t really have answers or solutions. At least none that can be practically implemented. My main problem with Bernie is his track record. He really doesn’t have any accomplishments except for the way he has voted. I think the president needs to be tough to a certain extent and I just don’t see it with Bernie.you need to have him back to ask about his experience getting pranked by Sacha Baron Cohen!They should have a minimum wage based on industry averagesThese long form discussions in the UK are shown on BBC in which we have to pay a TV license to view. For this reason they don&#39;t show advert in between or have ad breaks at all as they get their revenue from these licenses.Best of JREDont ever get it twisted i hate politics im on no sides im strictly for the people about the people fu ck outta here ELITE. Idiots need too stand up for themselves and overthrow alreadyI just want to see Bernie win so we can collapse this system already. Tired of kicking can down the road. Maybe a few million dead from starvation is the price we have to pay.You pushed on Candice Owens Bullshit, you usually push on peoples bullshit, why not today?  Why did you let the bullshit pass?My God.  Joe just letting Bernie spew nonsense with no pushbackWhat a bunch of bs! Nothing but softball questions! Joe didn&#39;t challenge him on any of his ideas. Even though I strongly disagree with Bernie Sanders I do believe that he should be treated fairly in this interview! But the whole point of a good interview is to challenge people&#39;s ideas and present the other side of the argument! Present the the real life consequences of some of Bernie&#39;s ideas and make him defend those ideas that he proudly advocates. SO DISAPPOINTING JOE!!!Bernie: &quot;Is Health care a human Right, not a privilege?&quot;<br />Joe: &quot;I think it is&quot;<br /><br />What the fuck? really? REALLY Joe? A RIGHT?! How can you FORCE SOMEONE ELSE to provide you the healthcare?Good interview 👍Voting is just an illusion for the weak minded , nothing will ever change with political manipulators from any partiesLol 7k dislikes from stupid right wing bots.Fucking lowlife has spent his entire life spending other peoples money all the while becoming a millionaire.I like Bernie, but he dodges every question and is way out of touch. And personal stories should be banned.2 minutes in and he is already saying we should pass laws forcing networks to give every runner airtime for free. LolHey bernie if you care so much about the corruption in DC why don&#39;t you start promoting term limits? Oh thats right because then you would have to do something that you&#39;ve never done in your life keep a real job.Democrats, you stupid fuck. Because of you Trump is president. What made you dumb fucks think crooked hillary was better than this man?can someone edit duncan trussell into this episode?But how R u gonna pay 4 it? but how r U gon pay 4 it?? meow meow! uh oh: looks like I got a fuckin kitten-brain where my normal person-brain sposta be, wHoOoPs!  D:Bernie on Rogan?? Whaaaaaaaat? Awesome!I love Bernie and i hope he’s the dem candidate but the only thing i worry about is the $15 minimum wage. I think it will cause businesses to cut workers. I think a ubi is the way to go, even half the level of Yang’s plan would help a ton of peopleWe be so much better if Bernie wins <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>60:06  BULLSHIT, THE FUCKING DEBATE IS NOT SETTLED.  GO FUCK YOURSELF BERNIE.FUCK YESDid you ask him why he went on his Honeymoon in Russia? Did you ask him since he’s got some money now has he donated 90% of it to the poor like he wants every other “rich” person to do?There is absolutely no positive outcome or change if we change the gun laws. Its the violence infected into people&#39;s minds. Its the movies, the music, the video games that give them ideas of some sort of satisfaction by hurting a mass amount of people. Its the admiration of violence. Its people with mental health issues. If they cant access guns there are hundreds of other options to hurt people. Arson, running people over, homemade bombs, so many different options.Ask the pickle salesman we’re did all his wife ‘s money come from?? Poor Jew from Brooklyn get’s them same money that all theWow that was amazing, very eye openingBigger government equals more corporate control, power begets power, when has this ever NOT been true.All the double digit IQ roganites coming out to dislikeHes great at telling everyone how terrible everything is but has no actual solutions.Imagine inviting Bernie Sanders on your podcast🤦‍♂️ I listened unbiased but come on people. Just like the green new deal, where is that money gonna come from..? Oh yah, taxes. The democratic party wants to worry, for the last how many years, about gun control, but now he wants to chime in because he is on a highly watched podcast. He doesn&#39;t care about the poverty. He says it because he wants vote. Obviously he doesn&#39;t mean it because of the before stated. Meanwhile the Republicans have been focused on it. Definitely had plenty of time. Wind energy requires oil to produce. A &quot;green&quot; wind turbine has an oil leak, so much worse then an actual production company. A turbine goes into decommissioning, it goes to a landfill and covered with dirt. Not recycled or reused. They have plans to make jobs for the oil and gas workers when fossil fuels would be done? Yah, I can say that too. Doesn&#39;t mean I have any idea how to do that. He&#39;s a crook and tried to use joe to target another demographic.Bernie is worth 2 million on line!..if it&#39;s true waaa!...kamala harris is worth 8 million joe biden 9 million this is why nobody believes politicians and why TRUMP is President ...The only way healthcare becomes a right is if you are willing to FORCE doctors to do the job. Nobody should be FORCED to do anything.Bernie &quot;We had a town meeting&quot; Sanders.Bernie completely forgets about small to medium sized businesses when he talks about business in general and the minimum wage. Amazon and Disney can absorb the raise in business expenses. Your local restaurant and mom and pop shop CANT. You will only have the option to buy from BIG business. His policy will strengthen the big corporations and hurt small time entrepreneursBernie’s shitty posture is the cauliflower ear of a veteran politician. Dude is a savage.If you do not support this man for President, you&#39;re part of the problem.Bernie doesn&#39;t know his ass from the hole in the ground when it comes to the 2A!I was told Bernie&#39;s crazy, but he sounds like the only one making any fuckin&#39; senseWe want to see dem aliens 👽!min <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a> .   &quot;ages zero-4 is the most important&quot; . -  Bernie .   <a href="http://www.hudsonseed.com/">www.hudsonseed.com</a>This communist is lying. Jesus people take an economics class or study it for free with a book or a video.What does everyone consider an assault weapon? A long barrelled gun with a stock? You think they havent weaponized those little pill bottles in your medicine cabinet?First Cornel West, now Bernie! Joe is killin it!Tha burn...must be on his meds today...he seems mighty chilled and relaxed and sugar coating his responses...and zero pushback. From joeJoe, PLEASE tells us that you&#39;ll get Trump on your podcast!!??Hey, since I&#39;m here... how about all you candidates just sit down in a room and talk it out? Only talk about what you relate on, find who shares the most, have him lead and use Roberts rules of order to choose like 2 or three candidates...whatd oo I&#39;m being arrogant and cocky again , my bad. Good luck, though, seriously<br />(Y)This was a surprising one. He does look really old here thoughClassic tactic, &#39;I dont know what to do about gun violence but we gotta do something!&#39; Quickly followed by &#39;think of the kids&#39; No thanks Bernie.Holy shit@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=17m55s">17:55</a> aaaand I&#39;m gone.Wait a second. Bernie is talking about Bezos&#39;s money and the rich having money stashed all over. Bernie owns 3 houses and has worked in government his entire life. Bernie drives very nice and expensive cars. He wears expensive clothing. Where did that money come from? I know people who make 2x as much as Bernie is supposed to be making and don&#39;t have half the nice things Bernie does. This is why I can&#39;t respect him. He&#39;s a liar.the only way people kill multiple other people is mental illness? really? have you ever heard of war? it&#39;s this thing we do REALLY well. there&#39;s a goal, people will stand in your way to the death, you kill them. doesn&#39;t take mental illness to fathom that. to reduce something like that to mental illness alone is fucking appalling against the mentally unperfect, untrue, and blissfully dismisses the the risk/reward scenarios that are involved with MOST of these mass killings. <br /><br />tldr, just because you don&#39;t understand exactly why they did it, doesn&#39;t mean you get to claim mental illness.Im just really not convinced. Every election candidates always promise the world. Then they get in and seems like nothing ever happens.I was so ready to vote for Bernie in 2016 he for sure would have won. His time is over.Bernie &quot;trying to stay relevant&quot; Sanders<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=11m30s">11:30</a> and now the commie shit starts. Go to Venezuela if you want that system.Check this out you dummies that support  Bernie ....   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni4PcTvWOBM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni4PcTvWOBM</a>This guy cant even sit up straight shoulders back...how would any world.leader take him serious....this dude is a total clownAll you yanks to buy into the the whole gun control stops mass shootings like they say has in Australia! We’ve had multiple mass shootings since 1996This is going to be hard, but I’m going to try. Wait a minute ain’t this guy one of (them)? Makes sense now. This sucks I’ve tried. I’m going to watch niggers street fighting each other.JOE ROGAN FOR PRESIDENT!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yangang">#yangang</a>It’s 2:30am I should probably go to sleep<br /><br /><b>sees Bernie/Rogan interview and clicks instantly</b>BahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaI kinda agree with Bernie in lots of things but what loses me is that everytime Joe asks: &quot;right... And how do u change that issue?&quot; Bernie comes with a politician tatic of avoiding the question by criticizing the problem even more so that Joe agrees and move on. U&#39;know? Its just a politician. Cant trust them.Unfortunately Bernie didn’t actually address the cartel power v drug criminalization question. Let down.Soft snake , if he wasnt hed wait , support trump and run as a Republican in 2024 .. but he&#39;ll probably dieThis is as bad as the first interview Joe did with JackTwitter. Didn&#39;t ask any hard questions. Joe came off as a groupie .<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=37m45s">37:45</a> <br /><br /><br />&quot;I believe in the 2nd amendment ... but I think we are all going to make some concessions&quot;<br /><br /><br />Stop being disingenuous and just tell people you want to confiscate their guns.I&#39;m very willing to talk about single payer health care, there are many reasons to talk about that. But this &#39;healthcare is a human right&#39; needs to stop. You never have a right to the labor or property of another person.Look how bernie sits. His shoulders are really high up by his neck like he is protecting himself. This dude is a beta male.The reason why there is no free education is because when you don&#39;t have to pay for it, the trained workers don&#39;t have a goal. The worst thing in life is not to have a goal, hence no reason to work 9 to 5 for giant corporations. The way to alleviate this is to put them in debt with the goal to earn higher wages in order to pay that debt. It is also in the government&#39;s best interest to have people with goals of earning more to pay that debt because when they are successful, you get to tax them.<br /><br /><br />Free education doesn&#39;t work in today&#39;s society especially when you have the corporations making the laws.<br /><br /><br />This is entirely my opinion and I acknowledge that I may be wrong.Bernie Panders for a whole owwer!What no DMT?Bernie is gonna winNot even 3 minutes in and he&#39;s already talking about free shit..  If you really believe anything is free you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to vote<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m30s">1:04:30</a> &quot;We were faced with a war in the east with China&quot; in 1941?After the demagogue bullshit he just did? Fuck you Joe.Sorry, but I think you should earn higher education, and why doesn’t anyone pay attention to Union jobs?<br />No such thing as an assault weapon idiot, it’s just a label people like you slap on whatever fits your criteria. And semi-automatic guns are used to overthrow a government that becomes tyrannical or overly socialist so we don’t become a 20th century China, Russia, modern day Venezuela, the others escape me currently. Weren’t kids traumatized by the Cold War drills? Mmkay.Lets give shit to everyone.Nobody reads these comments anyway. <br /><br />Fuck you bernie. You idiot yooman being. Forgive debt. Increase min wage. Free healthcare for all it’s a load of bullshit. <br /><br />1. Forgiving debt, if you have debt you consented to take in debt. <br />2. Increasing min wage creates inflation. <br />3. Healthcare isn’t a yooman right. It’s a good. If there is not incentive to be a good doctor why try any harder than the guy down the road who sucks. <br /><br />Ffs. This is the system on which western civ was created and became the greatest in world history. To fix what’s broken isn’t to prop up the lower class it’s to be fair and hold the upper class accountable, especially these politician who have 5 homes and made hundreds of thousands since being in office when their yearly salary as politicians is just a meer percent of their over all wealth.Why does Bernie sound like he wants to do the same things Trump is already doing.. aside from pipe dreams like free education. <br />I try to listen to this with as much non bias as I can muster. <br />But when he says we have 10 to 12 years left cuz of climate change i just wanna slap his teeth. <br />Again, C02 has no correlation to temperatures rising. <br />Its all about the sun. Only the sun. we have cycles on this planet. just tell us that our current cycle is almost over cause green house gas emissions dont mean SHITI’m pretty sure Chiner and Russiar will listen to you sir!Thumbs up my comment if you want Marianne Williamson next!The first people they will target is black people that actually just got there guns... shit that&#39;s like banning books...they hand out felonies for less...and who get shot the most unarmed vs armed. Police state much......BLACK PEOPLE ARENT STUPID.... FUCK THE COPS ALREADY HAVE SWAT....BATTERY RAM...DRONES.....GTFHey Bernie, quick question; how the fuck did you afford all your huge houses? Nothing to do with Hillary hu?I’m not saying I want President Sanders. Ever. But I do want to see Bernie vs Trump. Biden just can’t keep up.6.5 thumbs down!?!? 🤬🤬🤬 that’s BS. I support Bernie ✊🏽 . Thank you Joe 🙏🏽good podcast but would be nice if you asked about foreign policy rather than purely domestic issuesLol heavy.I am republican and proTrump2020 but I watched this and it changed my feelings on him just a bit. I think that some of what he said was true. But someone has to pay for the healthcare. Taxes would sky rocket. It’s impossible to do that without repercussions from the American people.We never went to war with China during WW2. If anything we helped them out.Why would you love an assault weapon?Politics aside, Bernie just seems like a really cool dude. I like a lot of things he stands for, and somethings I can&#39;t get behind with him. Does not mean I would never have him over for a beer, and a conversation. Good luck Bern!You have already provided your &quot;magic&quot; answer to the mass shooting problem.  If you improve the living situation of the regular citizen by covering education health care medication expence and raise minimum wage to a livable working wage i would all but guarentee thet you will see a deceease in deperate people amd a decrease in violent crime.<br />It all comes back to the rat park experiment and it doesnt only apply to drug addictionImagine still supporting Trump in 2019Uh-oh, I sense triggered right-wing haters are going to flood this comment section with their overly hysterical conspiracy theories of Bernie Sanders wanting to America into the Soviet Union, even though his policy positions only barely register as socialist.80% of comments: Im cool because I’ll listen with an open mind”<br />20% of comments: “Feel the Bern!!!”I&#39;m not American but for the love of your country and the working class individuals, vote for this man. This man has done his research!!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>If you look back in history you see the Labor movement, the Civil rights movement, and notice the Institutions that saw those movements as a threat beating them and killing their leaders right in front of them.I guess I need to register to vote now.I don&#39;t really like how Joe is just listening and asking questions about what he says only. He usually push&#39;s back with other ideas even if he don&#39;t believe in the other ideas to see if it is a valid argument. Like the healthcare is just as good or better. With the anti-pot guy and others he asks for sources but not with Bernie. I just have to assume its because he supports and agrees with him on a lot. He def. didn&#39;t agree with the anti-pot guy.This was cool to see and a great forum to really understand politicians positions. But I did feel like Bernie only has a surface level knowledge on most things. I hope to see other Democrats rise to the top. I&#39;d also love to see some Republicans on.<br />I would love to see Trump and Bernie on the same episode!! Like the Tim Pool Jack Dorsey podcast!Holy Softball questions ...Joe got Bernie to say he&#39;d release alien info on the pod if he becomes president holy shit.Going after these very wealthy people who have no regard for paying their fair share back into the system will require an enormous effort.  Be a part of it.  Let this go for a few more years and things won&#39;t be so pleasant.  Many will be aware of the problems Sanders has spelled out without the ability to centrally organize.  This is a very lucky opportunity for the now.amazing show.Joe, get Thomas Sowell, the economist, on so he can explain reality to the peasants.Please Bernie, make an ASMR video!!!i bet the bandwagon will begin, and we will end up having Kamala harris, Elizabeth warren, buttigieg on the podLet&#39;s make America great again.......elect Bernie Sanders in 2020I can’t stand Bernie SandersI&#39;m paying $1000 a month for healthcare and have to work to pay for that even though I&#39;m disabled.  My monthly premium keeps going up by 20% every yr.  In one yr or two I won&#39;t be able to pay for this.  It&#39;s a horrible feeling to think I will not get health care for my chronic disease within a few yrs because I will not be able to afford it.One of the few platforms you&#39;ll see left/right wing people, MMA/boxing champions, celebrities of all types, comedians, CEO&#39;s, billionaires, and many others. Love the JRE3 multi billionaires disliked this video, the other 6K plus are cucks for the 1%.Every person running should do something like this.Bernie Sanders sucks . Piece of 💩How does bernie define assault weapon? Definitions vary from person to person, legislation to legislation.  Kinda important.Lol I thought i was hallucinating when I saw this on front page for a sec&quot;Liberties of the people never were, or will be secure, when the finances of their rulers are hidden.&quot; -Patrick Henryok bernie is actually such a fucking lad for doing thisI LOVE YOU BERNIEDont think I have ever clicked on a video so fast in my lifeI have so much respect for those of you in the comments who had the critical thinking faculties to let this interview change your mind. <br /><br />Listen to him. Look at his record. Give him a fair shot. He&#39;s the real deal.Aliens.I thought by watching this I might come to like Sanders...but it just makes it clear that he doesn’t know much about anything he talks about. It’s 2019 and he still isn’t sure what an assault weapon is. He doesn’t know the “numbers” about anything relevant. And his solutions are just wishful thinking, based on no evidence other than, like trump, “it’s being done all around the word by many other countries”.%70 taxes!!! The 1% rules us all!  So basically let&#39;s take away all motivation for peeps like joe rogan to follow American dream!The communist is on JREJoe” now on the subject of drugs” rogan ✌️I&#39;m voting for you Bernie!!!BERNIE🇺🇸<br />BERNIE🇺🇸<br />BERNIE🇺🇸Won&#39;t be voting for him. I disagree with his ideas, but I enjoy the discussion.Increase taxes and force a certain way of living, take away the people’s ability to fight back. Makes senseLove the way you questioned his source of marijuana<br />Lmao<br /><br />Joe<br />Do People like you have to pay Bernie to show up ?<br />Or does he just bless you because you’re<br /> Joe Rogan?<br /><br />Damn must be nice<br /><br />If you accept him without paying him does that make you a communist?<br />🤣Slow bern sandersTheres an obvious direct correlation, the higher you raise the minimum wage, the higher the unemployment rate. You dont have to be a Nobel laureate to figure that one out.Even if Bernie Sanders does not win and become President, he has done more to change the way this country thinks than any one single person in the last 100 years.Party political broadcasts in the UK for each party lasts for 5 mins.So Bernie doesn&#39;t want to give free health care to non citizens? Btw trump has been working on reducing the cost of drugs to the price that Bernie is talking about but never give him creditJoe, if you held your own private presidential debate everybody would watch and you could do it right. Do it man.Bernie’s talks great but literally half the country thinks he’s a total nut. Tulsi Gabbard is moderate enough to actually pull a win against Trump while Bernie is likely to just split the Democratic Party up enough to get Biden the nomination, and there’s no way Biden beats Trump in a presidential election.The gun show loophole was debunked so many times.. you still need a background check.My man!I&#39;m starting to pay attention now love the people fuck the rich!!!Force free air time from a private company? Sounds like something Russia would do.Get Trump on your podcast Joe.I go to University of California, San Diego and housing is more expensive than tuition. Everything is privatized so they don&#39;t have to be transparent with what things really cost. For example, a russet potato is a dollar each in each of the on-campus markets. These markets that are built for students that live on-campus are more expensive than any grocery store in the area, including Whole Foods.Joe Rogan, one of the finest Bernie interviews of all time. Great job 👍I&#39;ve said it time and again. @JoeRogan is the new and improved Oprah of this era. He is what we need in this world. Thank you Joe!I love you bernie - but can you please explain how raising wages helps?  Isn&#39;t it simply expediting inflation?Presidency would kill this man<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=39m23s">39:23</a> &quot;we have got to do the best that we can do&quot; says it all.

He’s an appeaser and a phony conservative.As a conservative...Bernie has an amazing voice, man I just love that crackle in his voice...just me? Oh...damnproblem is the tax breaks are for all the people who run the social media and tech companies who in turn are trying to persuade the american people to vote in their favor so they can control all the wealthBernie is right the only way we make change is when ordinary people stand up... let&#39;s elect Andrew Yang and get our Freedom Dividend from these wealthy corporations! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a> M.A.T.HSo much beta energy from this guyIf we lived in a perfect world with perfect people, this might work, hahaPuddingSmall # of depraved people that want to kill others, ban guns.<br />A bunch of people drive drunk and kill innocent people, ban cars.<br />A bunch of people stab other with knives, ban knives.<br />A bunch of people will stab people with screwdrivers, ban screwdrivers. <br />People think about hurting others, ban people.<br /><br />When and where will this nonsense end? <br />RAISE YOUR KIDS PROPERLY and this will not happen.

Project Housing enslaves people. It’s next to impossible to escape. Pruit Igoe is Solid ProofI got a physical done in Alberta a month ago. Cost me $80 out of my pocket for the doctor to approve me for boxing. Our health care is not freei really want a Sanders vs Cruz debate on here. i would really like that.I liked it. Thanks Joe. I don&#39;t agree with some of Bernie&#39;s policies but I think he&#39;s right about other things too. It was a good discussion<br /><br />I&#39;m hoping one day Trump will be on. I think having some of the other presidential candidates really opened that door for the possibility down the lineDon’t go to a 50k a year college for a fucking art degree then maybe you don’t have to pay off the debt for the rest of your lifeSocialist scum.

Legalize marijuana. Require the release of the prisoners in jail for just that with expunged records. Make psilocybin and LSD easy to study at the minimum, better yet decriminalize them. Same for heroin and meth, treat them as a health issue. Johann Hari has been on here twice making very solid arguments on this subject.Never clicked so fastBernie &quot;I don&#39;t have the numbers&quot; Sanders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=19m44s">19:44</a><br /><br />Vs.<br /><br />Andrew &quot;If you look at the numbers&quot; Yang <a href="https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8?t=06m22s">https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8?t=06m22s</a><br /><br />Easy decision. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>Yikes.

Soon automation will replace retail, call centre and driving jobs. Only a UBI a Universal Basic Income can mitigate the damage automation will do to the job market. Yang 2020Awesome!  Pretty damn good candidate.Bernie is an incredible person. Regardless of disagreeing with him, please respect and listen to what he says. Everything he does is trying to improve our country for the better.Wow, joe moving the microphone, wonder why?Seriously Joe, your format, demeanor, approach and questions are ON POINT! It will fucking suck, but you need to do this shit for all candidates every four years.Our next presidentPoliticians only have half of a clue about health care.  Bernie is the same as most all of them.  They think government is the answer - it is all about votes and not about what is really best in the long run.  Medicare for all will stop medical innovations and make the good health care providers turn to private pay only.  We would be stuck in a VA style system with very few advancements.  Every Big Pharma companies are publicly traded and anyone can buy the stock.  Virtually every retirement plan owns some Pharma stocks.  They are making money just like any other major corporation - the numbers are all public record.did he just quote Yang in the first 10 seconds?Thanku joe for asking about aliens.   I would have done that too.    Great as t interview 👍Bernie&#39;s policies are still as kooky as ever, but kudos to him for coming on. Hopefully more candidates will follow suit.Lom his ideas are not radical?? LmfaoJoe finna get suicidedDecriminalize Cannabis? Got My Vote!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23iwrotethedamnbill">#iwrotethedamnbill</a>No talk of Bernie paying less than  $15 an hour to his staff.Surprising how he skipped over free medicare for <i>non</i> -citizens. <br /><br />Actually not reallyMeans alot having these canidates on. I can&#39;t bring myself to watch the absolutely garbage main stream news. I would like to see  all the candidates on a podcast in a  format like this ...Who is stable who want assault guns?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m37s">27:37</a> BULLSHIT. Yeah, states just decided to raise tuition. Horse shit. The federal government began guaranteeing student loans and making students indebted to the government while they guaranteed tuition payments to colleges. So colleges raised tuition to take advantage of the guaranteed payments. And when students defaulted, they end up in debt to Uncle Sam.<br /><br />And maybe kids parents should discourage them from getting into $100k in debt with bullshit degrees.<br /><br />Bernie’s “Wall Street speculation tax” would absolutely FUCK people with their retirements, 401k and any investing they want to do. He’s not just taxing Wall Street. He’s taxing stock trading. That’s something ordinary people do all the time and this elderly old fuck wants a piece of that.<br /><br />And the fucking balls on this prick to praise the cops when it supports his gun control horseshit but he was the first to demonize the police during the Baltimore riots.<br /><br />What a shitbag.<br /><br />And Joe cues him up time after time.<br /><br />Fuck Joe Rogan. And fuck his bullshit podcast.There is 0.1 % chance they will let him have the nomination. And 97 % of scientists think he&#39;s probably dead in 12 years.Bernie... how many Canadian Pharmaceutical Companies are inventing and developing new drugs that cure ailments and increase life spans? They don&#39;t have any costs to recover like American companies and if they do, they just tax the shit out of their patrons.BRooooooo China and Germany LOLI can&#39;t believe he got Bernie to smoke weedAs I was watching this a pharmacuticel add popped up. Can&#39;t hide from itFuck Politics. It&#39;s just &quot;this person thinks your species/gender depends on your feelings&quot; or &quot;that other guy thinks some micro-incidents on the news represent a whole religion of 2 billion people.When Bernie talks about other people&#39;s wealth he channels something satanic. Nobody can make billions of dollars without creating value in either goods or services and employing many thousands of people. Sure the system isn&#39;t perfect and sometimes people cheat but does Bernie have any idea how valuable these people are? Jeff Bezos? Steve Jobs? Bill Gates? Elon Musk? America would be nothing without them.Bernie Sanders is right with the position he takes. Trump is no different. Just different ends of the same spectrum.Bernie has good instincts to know that something is wrong. Unfortunately his solutions are terrifying and would have disastrous consequences.Y A N G<br />G A N GCanada =37 million<br />USA =327 million people<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=13m07s">13:07</a>   &quot;Could care less&quot; ?!?!   Sorry , you crazy old man but only a fucking idiot can&#39;t understand the proper use of the expression... You can&#39;t be President!!!  Go back to catching flies with your tongue in Vermont you fucking Lizard...Good schools<br />Drug policy reform <br />Healthcare reform<br />Having corporations pay their fair share<br />And a solution for these mass shootings?? <br />Why wouldnt you vote for this man.He said to ask the CIA if climate change is a threat, that&#39;s all you need to know.Have Bernie and Alex Jones on at the same time. It’ll break the internet.Throw a hammer and a sickle on that flag behind you Joe and you have Bernie’s Americaremember when Al Gore said we&#39;d be underwater by now?Yang&gt;BernieI really want to support bernie again, but I cant considering how he bent over and tooknit from Clinton and the DNC after they rigged the primaries, then to ignore that and say russia hacked the elections instead..... plus him being a white male is a negative thing in the eyes of far left voters, which is pretty slimey.Folks .. Bernie has an AGENDERYou guys are idiots!<br />This guy is an idiot!<br />What are students doing to get such large amount in debt?  I went to college and took loans and I had like $20k and I worked and went to college and graduated in 6 years with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  <br />This student loan debt is falling on deaf ears with me.  Then Rogan on his POT smoking silliness.Respect him for coming on but just for 1 hour? Is this the shortest Jre ever? It&#39;s probably close between Bernie and that dominatrix women6 mins in and he’s lying already- Canada’s health care is garbage- they have death panels.Vermont was one of only four states where poverty rose in 2016. Vermonters of color are disproportionately poorer than white residents, the report notes: According to census data collected over a five-year period, black Vermonters were more than twice as likely to live below the poverty line. I live in Vermont and Bernie sucksWhoa! What a guest!!Socialism never has and never will workThe working poor in america get poorer because their wages are stagnant and they can&#39;t get an wage increase, they can&#39;t get an wage increase because illegal migrants drive the cost of labor down. Raising the minimum wage only makes illegal workers more appealing.WHY IS THIS 60fps???I like everything about Bernie except for his policies.  Too bad.Joe should just give 20 candidates, dedicated to 20 podcasts leading up to the final moment when the DNC pick the primary one to go out and vs trump, and each candidate have the responsibility to put up advertisements to promote their upcoming podcast, whether its on television or social media/internet.Bernie Sanders VS Peter Schiff, Bet you won&#39; t  Joe.Comunist Bernie is at it again. Government entities have single handedly killed more people in world history than any other entity ever. Bernie wants the power of government to increase beyond measure. People need to wake up and vote Trump this coming election.good to see Bernie hereJoe, you really made the big time now, congratulations. Feel the Berne. ShakeUp. Tic Toc.You can have a system where RX is required to be negotiated ahead of time without a &quot;Medicare-for-all&quot; or FREE Canada healthcare system... He&#39;s not wrong about big pharma - but then he quickly goes off the rails. The healthcare delivery system in the United States is NOT broken. You have the best physicians in the world here in the United States .Thanks Joe. A shot in the arm for the Democratic Socialist movement. Bernie just just captured a million new votes on 2020.Network debates are just a pony show. Wanna know more? Joe&#39;s podcast is the future of getting knowledge to youth.oh god inviting a communist to the podcast.... JEEZDerp a derp derp.... what a foolZero. That is how many billionaires are funding Bernie&#39;s campaign for POTUS, He has 2 million individual donations from hard working Americans at an average of $19 not from Super Pacs, Corporations and Special Interests. Bernie is not for sale, He has twice as many individual donors as anyone else running including Trump!  He is the People&#39;s President. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23UsNotMe">#UsNotMe</a>Bernie Sanders/Andrew Yang 2020!!!🇺🇸💪Yeah my old high school responded to gun violence by turning it into a prison. They put up a wall around it and you aren&#39;t allowed in your class room unless you have your id, Even if every person knows who you are and the teacher. If you don&#39;t have your student ID you are not allowed to enter the school. Every one has told me they hate it, I would have hated it too. The solution to gun violence and school shootings is probably not converting schools into internment camps.What the hell is Bernie looking at while he&#39;s talking?Educated &amp; healthy people = strong Nation<br />Bernie Tulsi 2020✌Thank u Joe.....Bernie had my vote already but this just confirmed my pick.Wow suprised by thisGod I love this guy. Bernie was the REAL candidate in 2016 and he&#39;s the ONLY REAL choice and platform now<br />So funny how Joe turned into a socialist when given facts. Put the gop in front of him and suddenly he&#39;s calling this platform fantasy.<br />Remember rat park? The experiment? This is a disease of despair. He&#39;s so right. He&#39;ll break the million donor record. This is our POTUSI love how Joe didn&#39;t press Bernie at all on the &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban nonsense. <br />And he wonders why people say he&#39;s a shill lol.This type of forum is what all politicians need not theses bozo debates we have had the last two elections.I wish joe would just sack up and tell us who he is voting forThanks for doing this Joe. This was actually pretty educationalFFS!<br /><br />Bernie sanders: &quot; I realize that 99.9% of gun owners would never dream of doing such things in amillion years, but we have to understand that there&#39;s a small number of deprived people that will do such things&quot;<br /><br /> Seriously?<br /><br />What else is new? Waters wet... the sky is blue?<br /><br />People have been killing and done such things since the beginning of time, no matter what you do there will always be crime, there were always be death, there were always be war, that is not going to change.<br /><br />To sit there and say we have to make concessions when there is a very tiny amount willing to do something, is absurd.<br /><br />The only concession that needs to be made, is the realization and fact  there will always be  people in the world doing Bad things, and it&#39;s up to the individual to protect themself and be their front line of defense.<br /><br />It&#39;s time to stop playing this stupid game where we&#39;re going to pretend as if we can make the whole world one happy place where nothing bad will ever happen. <br />That is not an option, it will never be an option, and people need to quit acting like that is some sort of achievable reality.<br /><br />London England.<br /> Almost no gun ownership, crime with knives is through the roof, and they&#39;ve had more killings and homicides via knife stabbings  then New York City has homicides.<br /><br />killing is killing, whether it&#39;s done with a knife or a gun... what the hell does that matter?<br /><br />One gets to brag they didn&#39;t have a lot of gun deaths, meanwhile their body count with knives is through the roof?<br /><br />Now London&#39;s trying to ban knives as if that&#39;s the problem, these people don&#39;t get it.<br /><br />This is a cultural behavioral problem, and until you address the problem at its root, it doesn&#39;t matter what instrument you ban.Joe Rogan is the king of long form discussions. Politics, entertainment, etc. You name it, he does it better, babies.We needed Bernie &amp; his ideas 20 years ago.. but the present &amp; the future calls for Andrew Yang. 💯<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YANGfuckinGANG">#YANGfuckinGANG</a>Bernie sounding a lot like Andrew Yang in the beginning of this.Fuck this old socialist ass scumbag...Doesn&#39;t want America Working ,wants everyone to live for free...Listening to a politician on JRE is a complete joke!Joe “ hey Bernie have you ever done dmt “ RoganAnyone can say whatever they want about CDAs healthcare system, as a person who’s been in that system all his life of 35+ years I have never had a problem with our healthcare. And I don’t have simple health problems. Don’t believe most lies about our system. Damaged yes, but fair for all. Everyone’s equal.It’s not that Bernie is wrong on big money, it’s that consolidation of anything under government does not run efficiently and does not work. Our government is great at one thing ... wasting tax dollars. Don’t believe me check out our current social security program, check out government homeless and housing  programs, over 3 hr wait at clinics in LA., our national education system that continues to promise change and better education if we just raise taxes and throw more money into it.  No more “programs” no more taxes <br /><br />Have a great day everyone!Bernie addressing Pewdiepie’s MineCraft series.

Absolutely disgusting. Joe rogan, you are a slimy toe.It&#39;s easy for other countries to have socialized healthcare because they have the profitable American healthcare system to do all the innovation. I&#39;m all for paying less for healthcare. But you really want to see something turn into an incompetent hellish crumbling shell of itself? Turn it over to the bureaucrats to run. If the government is signing the checks, they will have so many regulations nothing will ever be done efficiently. I&#39;m no right winger. Morally speaking, there shouldn&#39;t be profit in healthcare. Practically?

They are really opening up about correction at the top.&quot;<br /><br />Guys, they are just running a different angle. Bernie has been a Rep for 16 years and a Senator since 07... He&#39;s literally placing his blame for what&#39;s wrong with the country on other people. If he couldn&#39;t get anything done in that time I have no faith in him. Just because he sounds nice doesn&#39;t mean he is nice. I&#39;m guessing half of you haven&#39;t met a car salesmanWhat&#39;s with the softball questions? This old fool talks about the poor yet has been in congress decades. Then rolls over for Clintons and robs a college. Lock him upBernie a socialist the economy would crash if he were electedWow Joe...way to lay down and let him spout propaganda without any pushback at allFree heart surgery if you’re still alive for the year you have to wait for that surgery....Damn Jamie, I knew you were a fanboy son...but this...this is quite a powermove!Ban the pencil....lol john wickHealthcare being a private industry in the us is why the us is the world leader in medicine, not Canada ...Crazy BernieBernie is wrong on british politics nearly to the levels of being deceitful.Thank you, Joe.We went to war with china?? Wow BernieThank you Joe, thank you Bernie.I wanna see Bernie, Alex Jones and Ben Shapiro yelling at each other on the JREMajority of America’s mass shooters have been on psyche meds....JOE WTF!! UR TALKING TO A SOCIALIST! IM sorry! But thats it for me . im unsubbingJo-oe i love you manThe rich will always stay rich regardless!!!!!! It will take hundreds of years for something to change !!!If you vote for this Commie you deserve what you get.Investing is the only way to get out of poverty not getting a hand out from the governmentI&#39;m actually for a tax on stocks. Stocks are for retards pissing away their money to let the filthy rich rob them.Bernie is great at explaining the problems and needs,pat of which I agree with. However I don&#39;t see much in terms of viable solutions from him.Can somebody pls explain to me what a assualt weapon is and what does he mean by military style rifle.Interesting. I still disagree with him on almost everything but glad he sat down with Joe. Thanks Bernie. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>joe &quot;just a couple times?&quot; roganFeel the Bern!You cant ban weapons.....Are you going to ban my fork ?Now let&#39;s get Tucker Carlson on!<b>Da one pacent don&#39;t want us to have legal weed!</b>Tulsi 2020 ads on the Bernie show.... I&#39;m dying!! 🤣This has to be one of the best episodes ever! Two of my favorite people talking about important issues facing our country!Awesome video man how could you not like Bernie I bet the people that dislike the video didn’t even watch the whole thing they just seen the name Bernie and went off YouTubeit cant be a right if you have to take it from another person at gunpoint.Joe is right: everyone is online today. What about JRE episode with the candidates together? No passing legislation needed for that. Slap in the face of TV.I appreciate Bernie&#39;s glowing review of Canadian health care. But, as somebody who&#39;s been through the system.. It&#39;s not perfect, far from it... I waited 11 hours in a waiting room with staph infection, in a large hospital with only 2 doctors working at the time. I was finally brought to a doctor after passing out in the waiting room. Unfortunately, my story isn&#39;t unique. Also our healthcare and insurance is provincially regulated.Bernie just said he would use an executive order to legalize marijuana.  Goddamn.Wow...stepping up your political game Joe.Bernie &quot;Pro worker&quot; Sanders but won&#39;t pay his staff what they want. What a joke.I used to say &quot;I like Bernie, I just wish he would educate himself on economics&quot;. Then I learned more about Bernie. He knows his policy would destroy the world, he&#39;s a communist, he advancing the global revolution. If the world gets destroyed on the road to a utopia so be it.Holy shit it&#39;s Bernie Sanders, awesome Joe keep at itTrump 2020<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m38s">35:38</a> and that’s why you won’t be President. That 4th thing is keeping you from making a difference.<br />It’s: Portable Hand Held Peacekeeping device you BIGOT. It’s not: assault rifleIf humans had the unity of ants all working to one goal, we would already be beyond the galaxy... Until we all stop buying the things they sell it will never stop.Long forum is needed but there’s too many blatant statements without a suitable answer. Case in point $15 minimum wage, he said that it’s not an issue because other places would have to do it too. But that’s a response that does solve anything. You still have an issue of having to raise your prices to where your typical customer won’t be able to afford it, not to mention to train an entry level employee, you lose two employees while training. It costs more to train than what people think you’re paying for the person that’s not worth anything cause he doesn’t know what to do and you have to pay the guy that’s showing the other guy how to do his job, not to mention the turn around of employees in those entry level areas are quick, usually they’re gone with in a week to a month. Your losses are even greater if you can’t get the guy to stay long enough for a return on investment of training. Bernie probably has good intentions but he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.BERNIE TWENTY TWENTYBernie &quot;BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS&quot; SandersWill this podcast surpass 3 mil views?!?!? Like if u think so!!!!I am not going to lie but I am scared for Bernie Sanders because the EVIL CORPORATIONS WILL TRY TO KILL BERNIE SANDERS IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LET GO OF THEIR GREED...BEST THING TO SURVIVE CALL OUT ALL THE CORPORATIONS EXPOSE THEM ASAP SO NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY CANNOT IGNORE THEM AT ALL GIVE FACES TO ALL EVIL CORPORATIONSthat was my wet dream tonightLoll joe got scolded. Bernie is americas dad!bernie for 3rd world nation 2020New Zealand is your example Bernie? You know how many gun owners have turned in their guns in NZ? As of a few weeks ago, 169 people. Give me a break.Sanders/Rogan 2020Saw an ad for depression medication during this video...<br />&quot;The policies and laws aren&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s your attitude.&quot;Better get a handle on that cold sore before it goes wild, Joe ;)<br />Great podcastSomeone get this man some fucking water holy shit.THIS MESSAGE IS APPROVEDBernie’s a great guy, but after listening to this there’s no way I can choose him or anyone else over Andrew Yang<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>I never knew Bernie&#39;s real political posture until today, I believe this video will change the way everyone thinks about social media as a source of serious and important information.Bernie bros in full effects!!!Yes..If you like Bernie you hate America.CNN told me that white men are a terrorist threat, so I can’t vote for this fascist.Thing about it is, businesses still pay taxes on their income corporate tax is extra and has nothing to do with the income tax that EVERYONE from the ceo down has to pay. Therefore if they are taxed higher than other countries they simply leave its been proven. If you were an owner of a multi billion dollar corporation would you stay here and pay the 90% in tax which we would all have to pay to do all the things the democrats want to do or would you leave and take the jobs and any tax money we would have. Federal Government needs to get tf out of education they&#39;re hendering progress because lesson plans are dictated by someone who never sees the children and it&#39;s largely indoctrination more than it is education and it get you ready for factory work or prison. Think about how it works we all stand in line and show up on time for 7-8 hours a day and start around the same time as factories and we weren&#39;t allowed to do anything without permission and, were taught to never question the government or the authorities. We should be doing it on a local level where the people making the lesson plans actually know the kids and the kids won&#39;t hate every second of their life and learn how to be utterly dull and just repeat what they&#39;re told is right and never ever think for themselves. That shit is child abuse that&#39;s my view. To expect to be able to hold all kids of the same age to the same standards and also standardized tests are useless because all you have to know is how to take a test, I can damn near ace any test u put in front of me if it&#39;s multiple choice. It&#39;s only a brainwashing facility and it&#39;s the very root of the problem second only to the fatherless home because of the culture that Hollywood and pop culture perpetrate. Family is the very foundation upon which civilization is built and to tell the truth like it or not, the idea of a republic or any free society would not be possible or at least would not exist as it is today without protestant Christian beliefsBernie sanders is such a loser. Imagine going your whole life believing in socialism.Ahhh. So that&#39;s why you stopped going live.You hate freedom if you vote for this mangod damn somebody give Bernie some water to clear his raspy ass throat.Crazy BernieSo we need to take guns away from law-abiding citizens for the good of the nation? Alright, well how about we just take guns away from black people since it&#39;s black people that are responsible for most of the murders. Yeah, lots of innocent black people will suffer, but it&#39;s for the good of the country!Lol you idiot bernie, you could not explain health care in 46 hours left alone YOUR ENTIRE CAREER. I&#39;d love LOVE to hear your plan to pay for it when our top 1%(Which you are in dumbass) leave the country for better tax laws....idiotAmerica may not have the perfect healthcare system. But we do have the best doctors in the world. When you have doctors who get paid off taxes. Then you have doctors who are gonna be under paid much like teachers are under paid. The quality of teachers have gone way down because it’s a high demand job with low pay. It’s not desirable. How ever being a doctor in the states means you have that high demand, but make a lot of money. You ask ppl from other countries with socialized healthcare, it’s not the best. I think we could come up with a happy medium. As long as these politicians are willing to have the conversation. Instead of one extreme vs the other.zero push back on any topic this was basically a waste of an interview, you learned nothing new. Was essentially lets run down the talking points on your website. I get being respectful to your guest but come on Joe!Check the free ebook bernie is wrong. com He may honestly have good intentions. But he is naive and wrong.Literally half of Rogans listeners are reactionary moronsNot Terry Gross, not Howard Stern. The best interviews are here.Love Bernie, thanks for having him on.Lost me at &quot;assault weapons &quot;<br />fuck outta here with that bs!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m00s">35:00</a> not true. You do need a background check and it is 100% illegal to sell your guns others the way he’s describing.He lost me on the gun control section. Oh well.This is way better than any debateWhat I love about Joe Rogan is he makes me feel like Bernie or any one of his other guests are just sitting there having a conversation with me. He asks questions some would be considered stupid because he doesn&#39;t act like he knows everything (despite being very intelligent) and is curious, he uses broad and understandable terms, he&#39;s controversial and speaks as a devil&#39;s advocate to appeal to even negative sides and most importantly, he&#39;s not paid off or can&#39;t be silenced by anyone. He&#39;s a great interviewer for a guy like Bernie, it&#39;s the perfect platform to reach out to the everyday American. I hope Bernie wins and Yang takes his Vice Pres. Either him or I&#39;d  settle for Warren or Buttigieg for Vice.&quot;It&#39;s legal because they make the laws&quot;<br /><br />Well wtf do you do in Congress Bernie?What I really wanna know is why YouTube makes you pay for mobile videos to still play when the app is in the backgroundFuck yes. Thank you Joe for having Bernie on. Thank you thank you<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Bernie is Hilary’s biotch lolGet Trump on. I’d love to hear him talk about his POV on things he’s passed. Great pod. It’s nice to hear Bernie actually talk even though I do not agree with most of the stuff he saidI like him a lot more after this interview, I have a difficult time with him screaming and shouting.I wonder how big Bernie&#39;s yacht is?? How about his 2 or 3 mansions? Yeah he is the 1%. Dont let this snake oil salesman trick you into buying his bullshit.god damn somebody let Bernie clear his throat.Why doesn&#39;t he look up ?&quot;Scientists tell us, we have 12 years left, to a point of no return&quot;. Al Gore said the same in 2006. Old man needs to retire. Alone. In the woods. Then he says we need a ban on assault weapons and 5 min later says we did have a ban on assault weapons in 1995 by majority of the republican vote. And no idea how to confiscate the 400 million guns. Very confused on the terms auto, semi-auto and assault rifles or weapons. Not the guy you want to contemplate on touching the second amendment.The most honest, caring, consistent and qualified person running for presidentJo-oe, wtf  cool broTrump will make Bernie cry if Bernie wins nominationWait. The top 1% saw a 21 TRILLION dollar increase in wealth over the last 30 years?? That&#39;s more than the annual GDP of the US today. That is fucking insane.I don&#39;t really know why, but all of a sudden I want Larry David on the podcast. That would be legendary.everyone says mental health , i don&#39;t think thats totally correct , its those with a bad ideals . Cant blame mental health , kinda not fair . But if we  look for those  red flags with individuals in our communities . Something seem a bit weird or crazy . Maybe say something , its not the gun but the individuals with bad intentions and they usually so signs , well most do .  As for gun manufactures , maybe they should have a trigger lock sold with every gun . Push the narrative of securing your firearms and training , vigilance in the community .Cuz that community is more likely to pick up the red flags.  Stop idealizing it . Its a weapon . Sure  Its cool you keep up at the range and train yourself , no need to idealize it . Educate yes . And bring up the marksmanship . so educate , secure , and vigilance . Thats the best i got . I don&#39;t own a fire arm , and beg you not to buy one , but its your choice . I ask to you as person in the fire arm community to help keep an eye out , We all can agree Enough&#39;s enough doesn&#39;t matter from where , rural towns to the inner cities . As for those illegals guns , maybe one gun at a time .Imagine being a useful idiot who hates Bernie because Fox News said so. This podcast shows that he’s literally the exact opposite of what is said about him in the media, and i cant believe that i fell for the trickery.This guy blowsTrump 2020Bernie is hella good at spending others peoples money...I wish he could get Teflon Don on here but I hear he&#39;s kind of busy these daysWhats an assault weapon tho? If you assault someone with a hammer it becomes an assault hammer? His idea on what I think is ARs and AK style weapons is stupidWhen you having Trump on?Which bank does this one work for?I disagree with Bernie on almost every issues. And so would Milton Friedman if we’re still alive today. But I can respect the fact that he did this interview.Why wasn’t any of Bernie Sanders statistics challenged on the big screen?FUCK YES. So excited for this!not voting for this comie!! taxing stock brokers for speculation?? are you going to pay them when they lose money?? i dint think so. This old white man is not getting my voteI&#39;m curious why he doesn&#39;t support UBI. Doesn&#39;t have to be a copy n&#39; paste from Yang&#39;s plan, but some form of it, no?climate change isnt even priority. increasing child nutrition in developing countries is topI will not make a concessionWe know climate change is real. No one argues with it. Climate never stoped changing and never will.unsubscribeI fucking hate Bernie Sanders and I don&#39;t want to see him in Arizona I&#39;ll embarrass himbernie &quot;it happens in other countries&quot; sandersAmazon grew on Dem watch.....Wanna see him Bern a YUUUUGE jointI have a hard time believing that Medicare for all is possible with over 300 million people.  The only reason this works in other western nations is because they have low populations.  I don’t hate Bernie but he and Elizabeth Warren are both pathological liars.  Also no one should trust far leftists because they are funded by big business. This is my video on Warren being a hypocrite: <a href="https://youtu.be/szS0rpKwDOU">https://youtu.be/szS0rpKwDOU</a>Candidates could make youtube videos and talk as long as they wanted.The MSM is shitting its pants right now that Joe gave Bernie a platform to explain his policies.superb podcastThanks for these great convos with the candidates, Joe!   &quot;diseases of despair&quot;, that&#39;s realThe whole hour wating for THIS cuestion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h06m48s">1:06:48</a> !!But has Bernie ever tried DMT?Maybe the reason America is the wealthiest country in the history of the world is BECAUSE they haven&#39;t done everything Bernie wants to do (and justifies the spending by saying America is the wealthiest country in the world).Bernie&#39;s a nice man, I think he means well but his misunderstanding of how the economy works, disregard for the 2nd amendment and his &quot;give the government control over everything&quot; mentality show he hasn&#39;t learned major historical lessons. However, I&#39;m glad Joe has all different types of opinions and listens with open ears.This guy is a jokeTulsi and Yang sounded so human on their podcasts. <br />Bernie just sounds like a politicianFuckin love Bernie!!! The dudes legit and doesn’t take a fuckin dime of corporate money!!!! That alone gets my vote!Thank you Joe for giving both sides of politics a platform to speak on!I think Joey Diaz’s podcast would of been better for Bernie Sanders.Wow Bernie angered all kinds of corporate shills 🔥🔥🔥Oh, here we go. <b>This guy&#39;s a goof.</b> If he talked any longer than 1 hour that would get obvious <i>real quick.</i> Go back to Russia, Bernie!Once you get past all the commie bull shit bernie is a nice guy..Marianne Williamson next plzIf healthcare is the healthy subsidizing the unhealthy, how do we use the state to force the willingly fat, unhealthy, and degenerate undesirables in society to do their fair share to get their disgusting fat bodies in the gym to help society as a whole reduce overall healthcare costs?Bernie didnt even pay his employess running his campaign $15 an hour.Joe Rogan you are the man! Thank you! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> ✊🏽🇺🇸<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=51m46s">51:46</a> taxesLoved him in 2016, love him now.  Tulsi has my ear as well at this point.  Personally, Biden needs to bow out IMHO.  Thanks Joe.  Shout out from Boulder CO.  Come on back some time.Holy Fuck ! Get hi m to Blaze or it&#39;s coldNot a bernie guy but if he did get in. Nothing will change we have endless wars, lobbists and a police state  that spies on its own senate congress ,president and its citizens. We will spin our wheels until the system crashes.So &quot;a very small tax&quot; will pay for the 2.2 trillion in student loan debt....okFree college for everyone is well meaning, but not that practical. 30% have degrees now, and we could increase the number of people that have degrees by some amount, but at least 25% of the population won&#39;t be able to take advantage, probably closer to 50%. Trade schools are an important component, but even then, jobs are requiring more and more education and experience, as manual labor diminishes from technological advances. <br /><br />Reduce the debt burden, for sure. But people with degrees have higher earning potential, so absolutely free seems a little unfair to people who are unable to complete a degree, they pay taxes too.This is a fight against greedy mass murderers, I doubt there wouldn&#39;t be just one who has no qualms taking out someone like Bernie. Hopefully most of them would be relieved that they no longer have to be one of the assholes destroying the planet because someone else would have happily taken their position.How much did Bernie pay Joe to be on?I disagree fully with these policies, but have a changed opinion of Bernie. Thanks JoeI’m only 1/5 of the way through this podcast and I’ve got a newfound revelation..... “I could be wrong and I’m open to debate” dems think of EVERYTHING as a statistical matter and only look at numbers to solve problems.... what they aren’t taking into account is the anomalies that coincide with those statistics. So when a decision is made based solely off a number they keep getting getting great results off the bat but in the long run it fucks them in the ass, Republicans look at statistics and ask the big question “WHY?”   Why are these stats showing these numbers and what can we do to fix it.          In conclusion democrats for the most part of we’re actually talking about a moral one, has a very good heart and wants the right thing but goes about it in a wrong way.    Republicans have been left to pick up the pieces from the dems and have had to make “harsh” decisions for the country to pull out of whatever mess it is in just to bring us back up to par so we can advance.       I’m already liking Bernie ALOT better but still.     We need to get this land mass of a ship back on track and a Democrat isn’t going to do it. That’s a guarantee.This podcast is definitely in my top five favorite from the JRE! Great conversation!!!!BULLSHITIf anything this made me not want to vote for Bernie. A whole lot of poppycock. Joe didnt even press him on anything. Lame....Corporations are King :(These KKKrackers always bring up mental health when some white boy slaughters citizens, but you never hear those same Chuds bring up mental health or PTSD when addressing Black urban violenceWow! Now Bernie Sanders is quoting Andrew Yang. LOL“diseases of despair,” “can you bring that up Jamie”?RoganThis podcast made my day!If he really cared about that woman. with all the money he has why didn&#39;t he take care of the medical bills I&#39;ll tell you why because he&#39;s a  socialist piece of shit.LOL WHATANOTHER softball interview. I can appreciate you having Bernie Sanders on the show, but what&#39;s the point if you aren&#39;t going to ask the obvious tough questions:<br /><br /><br />-Why did you cut your own employee&#39;s hours when they came to you and asked for the $15 an hour living wage you&#39;re campaigning on?<br />-If you campaigned and pushed the narrative that Donald Trump colluded with Russia because of a meeting in Trump tower then what does that make you for having your Honeymoon there? By your own logic wouldn&#39;t that make you a foreign agent?<br />-Why is it you bring up the Dayton shooter without mentioning the fact he was a radical leftist who said he supported  Democrat candidate Elizabeth Warren?<br />-If you are truly for the workers and the middle class majority of the country, why are you for taking away the only equalizer they have against an evil, oppressive, rogue government when you said yourself that citizens own more guns than the military? Isn&#39;t that the only leverage the average American has against a government that has grown out of control?Trump 202080% of what this guys says is great. The other 20% is complete garbage.Trump needs to get on.He&#39;s absolutely right about the pharmaceutical problem. Always buy generic.It’s honestly hilarious and par for the course with this wacky universe that Joe Rogan is the worlds best interviewer.  Thanks for the great content, Joe!Bernie cries &quot;POWER&quot;btw you can own a Mossberg 590M Pump-Action Shotgun 10/20 shots mags in Canada.Again. Bernie.  What is an assault rifle?Bernie was the only one with balls to go on fox by himself and had plenty of time .. don&#39;t know why he&#39;s worried about the debates since no one watches those channels anywayClimate change scientists have the largest lobbyist firms. When the government funds u to make models which aren&#39;t based in any factual research, and most if not all of the scientists build these make believe models aren&#39;t even climate scientists. Lol so until u have facts to back up climate change I dont want hear about it. Why would scientists tell u that there isnt climate change? Its because if they do their money will go away duh.I like Bernie but Americans are too dumb and greedy to vote for him.make it illegal for media outlets to report on mass shootings. most of us can probably agree that the media coverage of such tragedies is an unnecessary propagation of the bullshit.10 minutes it and he has either lied or mislead 3 times <br />I hope joe and phillip defranco team up to do a deep dive fact check on this because he says that hes not sure but then says its law very misleadingI can &quot;maybe&quot; get behind the education &amp; health care agenda... Completely loses me when he talks about gun legislation. Not voting for him. <br />For me it&#39;s Tulsi VS DonaldI believe this is THE moment social media becomes more powerful than conventional media in influencing and spreading information. I am so grateful to live in this time!It&#39;s nice to hear him when he&#39;s not shouting at the top of his lungs.Bernie is a lovely old man but his politics are rubbish. Pushing his agenda he lies. For instance, America has one of the best medical services in the world. Socialised health care such as Canada and England where i happen to be from cut corners and are overburden due to immigration. This is a fact, I&#39;ve been sick for 4 months in the UK so far waiting and waiting. Also He claims America doesn&#39;t negotiate the price of medicine which is just absolutely juvenile, what business does not discuss prices. Over here in England we actually buy a lot of medicine from Asia because its cheaper they do the same in Norway and i can be almost certain they do the same in Canada. At least Norway actually let the people have a choice between a re brand or the original.  He has a world view of a 13 year old that&#39;s just read marx but he&#39;s in a mans body.  Actually infuriated just listening to him as much as a chill dude he seems. <br /><br /><br />That being said Joe, you fucking rock my dude. get  Sargon on again he&#39;s grown a lot since he was last on to be honest. he&#39;s pretty keyed up on Philosophy of political ideologies and stuff and could shed a lot of light on it all.  Just don&#39;t mention Antia haha!screw the MSM. JRE should host the Democratic debate.If you go and make higher education free and forgive existing student loan debts, the significant chunk of Americans that didn&#39;t go to college for financial reasons will be put into a very unfair position.You&#39;ve lost me Joey.God Bernie&#39;s mouthclicks are killing me. Give the guy some water sheeshWHAT!!!! Never thought I&#39;d see the day!!!! YES&quot;Joe, i think you said it better than i could, you are right&quot; WTF joe, everyone&#39;s entitled to their own bias,  but you are , supposed to be interviewing candidates for viewers benefit!  Not their benefit or your own interest( least to to the exclusion of your viewers)Why is he on here after the pathetic appearance at the debates, i lost all faith in dems after thatIt wont be a livable wage when he taxes you to death and you&#39;re taking home less than you are now at this minimum wage lol it&#39;s a great idea but nothing is free and socialism doesnt work never has never willJoe missed the mark on this... way to soft ballwow ….just wow. bring on trumpMajority of people support those ideas Bernie said and they still voting wrong people to the office, so wha does this say about American people?:)Bernie&#39;s playing the sheep for fools lol my opinion of course but I&#39;d hate to say I told u so but if he becomes POTUS I&#39;m afraid it will have to be said.Way to pull him up on his bullshit Joe, he deflected the minimum wage answer about business&#39; closing down, he&#39;s talking about college and almost in the same sentence he says you have to go to college to get a job however people with degrees can&#39;t find a job, just spewing bullshit to win over the &#39;gimme&#39; voters...Would rather see Deion Sanders.If Bernie does ASMR he&#39;s got my voteAmerica’s Dad, Bernie Sanders.Bring back NDT. He’s dope lolReally hope you put Donald Trump on the show next!The lifelong worthless, immature, indolent, emasculated soviet style bureaucrat. I wonder how many working class, i.e. electricians welders mechanics, friends Bernie has. I suspect it&#39;s zero.Fuck Bernie SandersWow.  Most irritating thing about youtube comments is when it&#39;s an extremely active comments arena because it&#39;s impossible to return to previously posted comments to reply once notifications cleared.  Want to reply to idiot who claims &#39;there&#39;s lots of Canadians that would disagree&#39; with our health care system being a good one;  Smells like right wing US health care trolls where I hear blanket statement about &#39;us Canadians&#39;;  Thing is, I don&#39;t know a single Canadian that would trade our system for the crap US one that screws everyone but the rich.DREAM TICKET ... Sanders / Gabbard 2020 !Trump won the debates.Assault weapons ban <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Total_deaths_in_US_mass_shootings.png">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Total_deaths_in_US_mass_shootings.png</a>Gun control will not cure the mentally ill or confused. Correlation does not equal causation! Might aswell ban cheeseburgers because cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the U.S.Amazon pays Zero Federal tax because they DIDNT TURN A PROFIT! If the company hasn&#39;t made in profit after operating cost and overhead how can they pay taxes? Bernie is a COMAN! Really life Robin Hood rob the rich give to the poor.Just fixing healthcare alone would improve every single person’s life in this country. Including mine, my family is being fleeced $900 a month by the healthcare industry. Even if I had to pay the same amount through taxes, I Would at least know if I got too sick to work I would still have coverage.  When you need healthcare the most.First time I&#39;m not just watching clips and finally watching an entire podcastA consequence to having people in so much debt, particularly (but certainly not exclusively) when they go to specialty schools like medical and dental school, is we end up with people who went in with good intentions to care for people. But then the burdens of such debt, and the everyday pressure that it puts on these people, makes it more difficult to maintain a caring attitude toward their patients. <br /><br />We all know what it&#39;s like when we have a bad day. We inadvertently take it out on others. It may not always be in the direct fashion, but even <i>neglect</i> in a field like medicine can have just as negative of an impact.  Well, such debt can make virtually <i>every day</i> one of those <i>bad days.</i> <br /><br />Again, many go into the medical professions with <i>good intentions.</i> A desire to help and care for others. But then they get too overwhelmed with personal economic problems that are hanging over their heads every day for decades. They simply may not have it in them to maintain that level of care and attention that they would have otherwise.<br /><br />You know, this is actually the kind of impact people don&#39;t quite grasp when you talk about raising taxes in order to better everyone&#39;s quality of life. <br /><br />When the argument is made that people in other countries with these benefits pay <i>much</i> higher taxes, I rarely hear the counter argument of <i>&quot;Yes, but why do you think study after study shows the population of said country is actually happier and more contented? Isn&#39;t that worth the higher tax? They don&#39;t seem to mind it. </i><b><i>It&#39;s the whole reason most people want to make more money ━ To be happy and content.</i></b><i> Just imagine you&#39;re spending it on contentment. On peace of mind. On not having to worry about losing your job if you broke your leg. On not having to worry about missing your car payment because you broke your leg.&quot;</i><br /><br /><br />And heck, some countries don&#39;t even have an <i>income</i> tax. Just imagine if we did away with the income tax. And just paid taxes on goods and services. I&#39;m just saying there are other ways of doing things.  <br />¯\_(ツ)_/¯&quot;MY friend Beto O&#39;Rourke&quot; well that&#39;s where I stop listening.U raise wage U raise inflation U raise instabilityThe healthcare system up here in Canada has it&#39;s kinks but we take huge pride in it. It has put my life back on track after a bad injury. The bill? 0$ out of the 45 K$ that it actually cost to treat me. The healthcare system saved me 45000 dollars.People really vote for this guy.... wasted votesWhy would any liberal not vote for this man, he has my vote.The ideas that I have aren&#39;t that radical. In fact they already exist in many (socialist) countriesBernie or BustI&#39;ve completley changed my mind on bernie, might be my pick now....U got this babbling idiot on ur show joe😂😂😂😂😂<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m30s">47:30</a> quote from Breaking badAs an italian i can&#39;t believe how healtcare is still not guaranteed in USA.  It&#39;s a truly barbaric thing for such a rich and powerful nationMedicare is a broken system.... It&#39;s not a real solution to healthcare for all.... Shiit it&#39;s horrible for the elderly as it is ..and he plans on extending that nonsense system to the younger generation... Give me a break.... Ask of any of your old folks who is going thru hospital fights because part B doesn&#39;t cover the necessary medicine or procedure.Powerful Bernie, powerful podcast.We fought China in WW2?!anyone with an 101 economics understanding knows that this guy woud implode the us economy in less than a day with all this free shit chantThis guy has made a career of doing nothing where he had the ability to write new laws, but thinks he can create change as President?!!! Get outta here.Bernie doesn&#39;t make very much eye contactPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SHOULD BE ON JRE&quot;White people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot;<br />-this rich boomerJoe’s right wing audience is going nuts seeing this lolI love how Bernie remembers and tells all these stories that the people he spoke with told him. He really cares and listens to the people.Love from KentuckyYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYI go to a naturopathic doctor and pay cash. I didn&#39;t finish a college degree because I didn&#39;t think it was worth it. Why am I going to have to pay for someone else&#39;s college and doctors through higher taxes in the future? That is called socialism! Not everyone has the same aspirations. The world is changing at lightning speed and this idiot is talking like he&#39;s from the industrial revolution.How come there are only left leaning candidates on this show? there&#39;s been a 1 every months.Is college tuition a shock to people? how do people get into 300k or 400k dollar debts? im pretty sure they know how long it takes to get the degree and how much it costs per term.I don&#39;t think Joe should host the Primary debates but come the general election... He should totally host the 2 nominees at the same time to have a calm, civil debate about policy and not the mudslinging joke that debates usually are.Joe whats an assault weapon?<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieRogan2020">#BernieRogan2020</a>! FREE MARIJUANA &amp; DMT FOR ALL!Please tell me you smoked a joint with him!Toe Rogan sucksI love joe hes such a good person authentically not jus panderingPretty sure we didn&#39;t fight China in ww2Did Bernie hang out in the isolation tank?I may not agree with what the man says, but I understand why people, especially in my generation do; and I&#39;m willing to listen.Anybody else feel weird when Bernie is not <a href="http://yelling.lol/">yelling.lol</a> hope he wins...Not that I completely disagree. I am poor. I invest in the stock market to try and better my finances. You tax wall street and all you did was cut out the lower and middle class from being able to take part and take a bit more from the rich. Am I not allowed to try and make a buck too?We have lobbyists because lots of politicians don’t know shit about anything but getting re-elected. They need lobbyists telling them how to avoid fucking over the economy.JRE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE! Joe hosts jamie fact checks their bullshit. And we get on with our live. Better than CNN and FOXWait so they didn&#39;t smoke a blunt ?Fuck this old socialist raisin.Is this the shortest JRE ever?Holy shit the number of lies in the first 10 minutes was unreal...a whole lot of morons very obviously commented without watching the interviewThank you for Bringing Bernie to your Show Joe, he&#39;s a good man and so are you.The opioid epidemic hit Canada before the US, and is a global epidemic.  Google any country and &quot;opiod epidemic&quot;.Bring it on Bernie try to take my gunsYang Gang for life but Bernie has my respect.The fact that universal healthcare is not radical shows how left the center has gottenOur future presidentUntil something is done about lobbying, the United States will never get out of the hole it&#39;s in.The millionaires and billionaires!!He talks about problems but not solutionsNo, you can&#39;t LEGALLY walk into a gun show and &quot;buy a dozen guns and sell them to criminal elements.&quot; That&#39;s called straw purchasing is already illegal.<br /><br />Notice NONE of Sen. Sanders proposed solutions involve anything BUT gun control.<br /><br />Sen. Sanders doesn&#39;t even know the basics of the AWB (which, studies show did NOTHING). It had a sunset clause, but there&#39;s a narrative...I dont like Bernie, I think his policies are  ridiculous. I do however respect him for coming on the show.Bernie sounds like he is running for president of other countriesI don&#39;t believe in a ban of any kind but there could be some form of limits to how many are made but never ban them that will not fly with the legal gun owners99% of the shit we find in our grocery stores is what is killing America. We live and act like libertines and wonder why only America has high healthcare costs. Eliminating sugar alone (willingly, not by law) will save 100k lives in America every year. Metabolic syndrome is killing our healthcare system. Sure, let&#39;s keep slicing our wrists and keep complaining about the cost of band aids. Third world countries are healthy countries. Think about that. Statistics do not lie - people lie. Mainly to themselves. Fuck Bernie Sanders and fuck Rogan for having this parasite on his show. Do not give these charlatans a chance to hypnotize the public with their bogus compassion bullshit. This rich asshole is about POWER - CONTROL - MONEY.Hey Bernie. I paid for my college in full. Will I be getting checks?Trumpism causing you insomnia? The Sand Man can help with that.Bernie says this like he hasn&#39;t been in the Senate since 2006 and in the House of Representatives from 1990 to 2006.  He still can&#39;t explain how to pay for anything except to say tax the rich. Rich people are very good at staying rich. Good luck with thatThough that shit said Beanie Sigal at firstjre having two huge candidates on ... praise be praise be&quot;Diseases of despair&quot; stinks of white privilege. Bernie is right but I am just displeased when I hear terms that created by white people that exclusively for white people. When crack was distributed by the CIA and black people lived red lined neighbourhoods designed for them to perish in, did they call their addiction &quot;Diseases of Despair&quot;. No they locked them all up.Lol at all us Joe Hogan fans liking Bernie after this<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yang">#yang</a>Joe did a great job of interviewing and getting answers.  Sadly, these topics are impacting the USA in a big way.Trump podcast WHEN?As Bernie speaks about drug companies and their being profit driven vampires, A depression medication ad pops up...gotta love it.I LOVED THISRaising minimum wage won&#39;t help if there are so many problems up in the higher levels. Greedy upper levels will just find ways to make up for the money they have to pay out.Sorry Joe this is the first podcast I will not be watching...Wealth inequality? It&#39;s because the US went off the gold standard. It corresponds perfectly with when income inequality rose. Why? Because the federal reserve prints currently, in any amount it wants, whenever it wants - and that printed currently lands in the lands of the banks first. Want to fix income inequality? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EndTheFed">#EndTheFed</a>  Also, it&#39;s dumb to gripe about taxes - why do we pay taxes to the federal government if the federal government can and does print as much currency as it wants? Educate yourself.Never trust a man who can’t keep eye contactUS Corporate Tax was one of the highest in to world until recently, where it&#39;s still higher than most of Bernie&#39;s beloved Europe... Should Amazon pay tax? Yes. Should we raise corporate taxes ? No.Hey, Joe!  I know you had Colion Noir on but I&#39;d be very pleased to see you have a Gun youTuber on.  Like Eric from <br />Iraqveteran8888, or Ian McCollum from Forgotten Weapons.I like ya Bernie, but Andrew Yang is the only truely 21st century candidateWhy can’t we have a Democrat President and a Republican VP? It would bring better balance in.Not trending? WhyI would love multiple campiagn just make group debates on youtube between each other no audiance except the comment section&quot;Canada&#39;s health care quality is as good as or better.&quot; As a Canadian, I can assure you, this is INCREDIBLY wrong. I do travel a good deal and my family has had to use hospitals in the US. The quality is several times better. I&#39;ve used hospitals in Mexico, and that was significantly better. The health care system in Canada is free (not really, we&#39;re taxed very hard) but the quality is horrible because the doctors often leave for better paying positions in the United States. I had to see a specialist a few years ago and it took me ELEVEN months just to have my initial meet with him. My family doctor (where it takes 2-3 weeks to speak with a doctor/get an appointment) has told me many times to cross the southern border if I want expedited care. This is not something you want.Oh, Shiiit! I did not see this coming. Bernie is the best choice for 2020.I want to ask Bernie how small businesses can survive a $15 minimum wage, I.E. mom and pop restaurant startups? This is a huge portion of my cities economy and is one of the attractions for tourism in this area. This is a serious concern to me, if he could answer this question for me whether it means making them tax exempt or minimum wage laws only applying to major cops is vote for him tomorrow, until then I can’t support this dude.Bernie likes Ross P, interesting.Changing laws, is not dependant on Bernie. That&#39;s up to the congress.Wow.I had to pay for crutches and a cast. Heart surgery is not free in Canada. Heavily discounted and pennies compared to the states but stop saying all healthcare is free in canada&quot;Assault style weapons&quot; are not designed to shoot human beings. I like alot of what he said but he doesn&#39;t know shit about guns and weaponsbut what does he think about immigration?If ages 0-4 are so important, how about we enable parents to stay home and raise their own kids, instead of being wage slaves while other wage slaves raise their kids for them?Wow Bernie on the JRE this is fucking great I hope he gets a few more but if not this is still pretty greatNot helpful.....no quantification of claims that taxing wealthy will pay for his programs....no better than the 15 second sound bites.  And, finally stopped watching at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=28m00s">28:00</a> when he whined about cost of education and did not call out universities for over charging the way he did with pharma.  Love his ideas but still didn&#39;t see figures along with his facts. Very disappointing interview.I&#39;m no fan of Sanders or his wacky, left-wing ideas but you have to give him credit for having the balls to appear on Joe&#39;s podcast and FoxNews, though Joe doesn&#39;t really put the irons to the fire. The other Democratic candidates won&#39;t go near FoxI was really hoping Bernie would have a unique view on guns and gun control. But it&#39;s just the exact same thing every other Democrat ignorant about guns, but desperately to take them away. It definitely doesn&#39;t help his view that he&#39;s not a totalitarian dictator.timestamp when they smoke a blount?The probelm i have with 15 hour min wage is what it does to the people who have worked hard to pull above min wage. For example i a construction company and have a 20 year old who has busted his ass to get to 16 an hour. Its not alot but we are a small company and cant afford to pay laborers a whole lot. I make more money then the owner does. If min wage goes to 15 he is back down to the bottom on wages. We would have to pay him 21 an hour to keep him at his current lvl. Alot of small companies wouldnt be able to do that. It helps the people who are at the bottom but hurts those that have put in the work to get out of the bottom. Not to mention that the cost of living will increase so not only is he back at the bottom, but his buying power goes down. Its not about what you make, but what you can purchase.People who don&#39;t like Bernie need to watch this.One thing I didn’t here Bernie say was anything about trade school and apprenticeship like they do in Europe , we don’t need to spend more money on bullshit college education when we don’t have enough SKILLED LABOR.. go get a goofy diploma in art history,  women’s studies  or “liberal arts” and see how much you will get paid compared to a skilled welder and other trades. Of course in trade school you aren’t indoctrinated your just taught a VALUABLE skill, how could that make sense? AND OF COURSE we have a shortage of lawyers so make sure they get free education so they can fully suck every last penny out and or become politicians. I AM ALL FOR FREE TRADE SCHOOLS , And PUT THEM IN LOW INCOME AREAS SO PEOPLE WHO NEED GOD JOBS MOST HAVE A SHOT.Are you sure that&#39;s not Crowder????I think it&#39;s everything you guys talked  about on here that leads to these mass shootings.Joe usually great at interviews. Best there is, but really let down by this. Didn’t question ( challenge) Bernie on anything. Did not bring up facts like he usually does. DisappointedBernie would have wonJoe should have every single candidate as well as Trump on individual episodes because this is far more informative than any televised debate.However your student loans are forgiven if you perish, its literally easier to kill yourself than to go bankrupt in America.. Yet people wonder where mental illness comes from.Bernie doesn&#39;t support Reparations so I support someone elseMy man big bern. I will back this man up to the fullest. RegardlessTelevision in the UK is owned by the Government. Thats why they have to give equal time.Joe Rogan feels the Bern lolWhere my Russian bots at?!?!I didn&#39;t watch yet, but what&#39;s with all the dislikes? Antisemitist feminazis?dog....are you fucking serious? in 2013 I never would have thought Joe would be here.I gave up on his ideas when they hit gun control <br /><br />Tragedies like this are sad and our outrage is justified, though we need to measure our outrage with a temperament of logic. <br /><br />First: Only law abiding citizens will comply with gun restrictions and prohibition laws. Thus leaving the illegal guns only in the hands of criminals. Such laws have shown repeatedly that they won’t deter determined criminals who are intent and willing to break the law to effect acts of mass violence. <br /><br />Second: How far would this gunman have gotten if EVERYONE was armed at the location the gunman targeted? How determined would they have been if it was common knowledge that EVERYONE at the location was armed? <br /><br />By sacrificing our rights to self defense in an effort to deter crime or as a measure of law; we leave ourselves vulnerable to those who would deliberately break the law to hurt peopleLol war in the East with China...in 1941 hahahahaHe made it 3 whole minutes before he said FREEMedicare for all is only the selling point. Democratic socialism is the elimination of profit. Takes ownerships from citizens and claims its for the good of the people. We need to keep Government SMALL. He’s been telling people for decades that the rich are evil. However his solution is to take money and decide where it’s spentIm not a fan. But i will listen to what he has to say. Its only fair.Can we not fuck this up again America? Lets elect this guy and put in end to corruption and use our taxes for shit that actually helps us. Bernie 2020 mfs.Ok, Bernie, Abby Martin, Cornel West, Tulsi... you&#39;ve had a few left leaners on now. Thank you! Please keep it up. These are important perspectives. You can&#39;t spend so much time with Anti-SJW types and then forget to invite on those leftists who are faaar from &quot;SJW&quot; caricatures.Love you joe but how about a follow up question and at least a little push back. One being corporate companies can afford a 15 minimum wage, but small business can’t because they work on smaller margins. This is another jack dorsey situation.&quot;when drugs are illegal, criminals sell them&quot; ... Mmmm... OR when drugs are illegal the ppl sellin them are called criminalsBreakfast Club had Bernie first!I&#39;m feeling the BERN!!!! Now get Biden on here and ride his ass down Joe!The day joe broke you tube with a commie.Yanggang thoBernie gots a pair of big Hanging grapefruits for what his saying!!Politicians ... What a waste. No solutions for any of the issues he presents. Always talks about 1%... How they are not getting taxed and free education.... But never hits the core of the problem... For example, Universities are part of the 1% and are 503c, which means they DO NOT get taxed in EVERY form they generate money INCLUDING NCAA games. But, he doesn&#39;t say it because it doesn&#39;t benefit marxists; since, it is the modus operandi by which they indoctrinate intelligent people.Please book the author of The Irishman/I Heard You Paint Houses (Charles Brandt). The Martin Scorsese/Robert DeNiro film drops later this year: <a href="https://youtu.be/1Expe7hf6MU">https://youtu.be/1Expe7hf6MU</a>What about the collusion hillary pulled off to fuck bernie? You suck Joehis voice is insane. he doesnt sound like a fragile grandpaShame. He has no chance..DNC will make sure of it...Where does the supply of Doctors and Nurses manifest to handle the demand of Free healthcare?<br />Plus a raise in minimum wage that is side-by-side with a Nurses pay? <br />That’s is an appetite for Massive Incompetence!Barnie talked for a hour. how many real proposals did he bring? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AndrewYang">#AndrewYang</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>this guys a fuckin loserLess than 5 minutes in and Bernie wants to pass legislation that would force networks to give free time to potential candidates?<br /><br />I couldn’t see how that could go wrong, Jesus.If they do anything they should keep the entry level wage and make it law if there still working past 90 days or 6 months then make it law they have to have the living wage raiseWhy would you give this socialist the time of fucking day... Joe, you The Man ... Keep those guests coming, you&#39;ve become what we needed before we knew we needed it ... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AboveAverageJoe">#AboveAverageJoe</a> ...Just when I thought Bernie couldn’t get stupider.....he goes and mentions the planet is fucked in 12 years.So me and my wife working our ass off to pay her student loans off to 95% and Bernie wants me to pay some drs. student loans off, while trying to take my guns away. Kick rocks old man.Only a dumb shit would vote for this buffoon.Now Bernie needs to get on Ben Shapiro’s Sunday Special. I want him to be challenged in a polite and intellectually honest way.I cant shake hearing a white Joey DiazFirst thing out of Bernie&#39;s mouth is plagarized from Andrew Yang&#39;s closing statement 😂😂<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>Bernie loses. 100% next pleaseGreatly unbiased questions from joe. Excellent interview and I’m a conservative against Bernies ideologies. Bravo JoeSucks he&#39;s just  not crooked enough to be president. 😁😉😆Politics not my forte BUT!<br />I think its awesome that he got Bernie Sanders on here<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E_-4UEzjyKI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E_-4UEzjyKI</a> 2017I wonder if Bernie smoked from that kush<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EditedByYoungJamie">#EditedByYoungJamie</a>That was disappointing.. he just stayed on script.. joe could have brokered a meeting with trump and Bernie to see if they could agree on a few things and gift wrap it for the countryEvery time joe has a candidate on, I gain a new respect for said candidate.  I’m independent leaning slight right, but now I SEE Bernie for Bernie. Not what we are headlined. I disagree, but RESPECT his views now. Joe needs to run this shit. Fo sho.I don&#39;t hate Bernie, but I&#39;ll never vote for anyone that pushes the identity politics as hard as he has been nor will I vote for anyone that wants to infringe on the 2A. We need to stand together as Americans, not as our skin color. How have we not learned that? As for the 2nd Amendment, the government should have a healthy fear of the population.Bernie should educate himself on gun shows . You cant walk out of a gun show with a gun without an ffl license.  Any gun bought at a show must be sent to an ffl holder who is responsible for the background check before handing said gun over.Tulsi, then Yang, then Tulsi again. Now Bernie. Dudes on a rollWould love to hear Elizabeth Warren on JRE!How will the USA pay for medicare-for-all?<br />With about 50% of the money they are spending right now.All Americans are 1% of the WorldThe chances of this decrepit clown beating Trump are zero! Everything he says is either a bs fairytale or a lie. Plus I was expecting him to keel over in the middle of the podcast. Tulsi seems the best choice so far.I’m surprised and impressed Bernie did the podcast. Go Joe!Holy fucking softball questions joe!!How does Bernie Sanders feel about the Federal Reserve? Hmmmm?Joe Rogan 2028 for PresidentOvermedicating of kids is likely due to a mix of parents&#39; googling skills and defensive medicine. Lose the lack of faith in experts and make sure they can give their objective advice without putting their job on the line.Great show joe. Thank you for your time Bernie.This guy is a walking fallacy. Hard to watch.Where is Soph?The issue is he acts like the middle class would not be taxed more if US had universal healthcare. That is a lie.In Canada the bill for heart surgery may be zero, but you may also die waiting for the surgery.Thank you Joe Rogan this is big for the country right here !!!!!Best question was the last one honestly. Everything else we already know about the guy.Uh, who here would be employed, if in fact there did not exisit the wealthy enough, to pay the capital cost, aswell as the wages of every employee within it, aswell as, insuring their liabilities, ontop of covering each employee with, w.mans comp, 401k matched at twice what the employee invest, that shit doesnt, and wont exist. So, get off your fucking tech, and learn a trade that could in fact, improve your life, aswell as increase a secure infastructure for future generations to use.Get this man some water! LolSorry I can’t vote for anyone who doesn’t do at least 2 hours on roganSocialism has left 100 million corpses in 100 years in its wake.   This ideology is very dangerous.   It does not work.No fucking way5 minutes in, and right away he&#39;s full of shit. I live in Canada our healthcare sucks ass. This using Canada as positive model for health care  is ridiculous. Example? Go to the emergency department, first thing you get is triaged by a triage nurse, and its done by a number system 1 through 5. 1 being very serious and 5 not so serious.Each number is suppose to give the doctor a response time. 1 right away 2 5-10 minutes 3 within 15 minutes 4 within an hour or 5 within 2 hours however I&#39;ve seen 8 hours. Remember this is government run and the nurses are being protected by unions, so they can slack and get away with <a href="http://it.now/">it.Now</a> back to being triaged. Depending on the nurses mood or attitude she could triage you a 5 when really should have been 2 or 3, but because she doesn&#39;t like you she does a 5 nothing you can do about that,and you don&#39;t know your triage score.Here&#39;s an example <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-brian-sinclair-report-1.4295996">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-brian-sinclair-report-1.4295996</a>  Yes sounds good because its free but what good is that when they treat you like shit.FEEL THE BERN! LETS FUCKING GO BERNIE LETS GET THIS BREAD MY NIGGA!Gloom and doom Bernie!  LOSER!bernie will win the mid west, where he has pledged to help those people outSoftballSo when&#39;s Trump dropping by?That&#39;s awesome! Bernie is my guy 👍 Sanders &amp; Warren 2020So many right wingers in the comment triggered by facts and logicTerrible. Didn’t press him at all.I love you Joe but FUCK BERNIE SANDERS!!!! FUCK SOCIALISM!!!!welcome to narniaDamn that was a good oneIf the DNC didn&#39;t screw him he would have beat Trump in 2016, not going to happen in 2020 though...Bernie is a nice guy that doesn&#39;t understand very basic math.People leaving college are often the most unproductive unskilled most incapable people I meet. Years later they are no where in life.<br />Young age apprenticeships and a disconnect from the &quot;You must go to college&quot; social attitude are what we need.<br />Everyone going to college would only make the problem worse.Think i puked a little in my mouth ... bye bye joe moving on to another channel that has somebody besides a lying piece of shit on ... enjoy getting burnisized ...I tried to find where amazon doesn’t pay taxes I couldn’t find anything. To my knowledge they paid %10 in 2018 which is definitely low but someone explain. Also wouldn’t they just raise prices to make up for it? I’m trying to understandWhy are 90% of the comments just pure trumptards.Yeah.. I&#39;m still voting for Trump though.Yea but in Canada you&#39;ll wait a year for your surgery and die firstYell and take your clothes off Bernie, sling that saggy ballsack all over America’s face.<br /><br />DO ITBernie is gonna fuckin loseI&#39;ve been on this earth for 33 years. My whole adult life I&#39;ve been hearing the same questions being asked, and the same answers being givin. Same old shit every 4 years. Same old faces. By definition we are insane expecting different resultsDon’t agree with even half of what Bernie is about, but a solid and enjoyable conversation. Props to him, I don’t see many other politicians that would come on and chop it up like that.Not a Bernie supporter, but great interview.Soft ball interview.... soooooo softOne of the best ones yet, term limits for politicians no lobby money for anyone<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=29m20s">29:20</a> I wish I’d heard this part before. Look at that. A right leaning Libertarian agreeing with a socialist.&quot;Assault weapon&quot;. To Bernie sanders: I believe in the second amendment but... Nope. No. No no. Bernie you can eat a giant bag of dicks, assault weapons were never banned. You socialist  piece of dog shit. Canada, Europe, New Zelands, Las Vegas. Ptsd. Medicare for all, Bernie you are a loser. Move back into your mom&#39;s basement because that is your target demographicWhen he says yes I understand that 99.9 percent of people that own guns wouldn’t commit these crimes. But because if the small few that fuck it up everyone should give up they’re gun. Get the fuck outa here man.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=38m16s">38:16</a> Bernie picks his nose and wipes on pants...Now go on secular talk Bernie!Bernie will put all small business owners out of business with his minimum wage and get half the work force fired. He knows this. He knows only big corporations like walmart and Amazon that dont pay taxes can afford to double their minimum wage. He will be doing the corporate world a favor.Bernie “Marijuana Ain’t Heroin” Sanders 😂😂😂 ❤️See how the conversation seemed to naturally shift back and forth between topics? That’s cause every issue they raised is connected and you can’t address any of them unilaterally. Health care, education, quality of life, climate change, gun violence, corporate power/political corruption, drugs, prison, etc. all intertwine and have to be reformed together.So he&#39;d rather see people dead in the streets because of socialism instead of guns😂😂😂Why couldn&#39;t Joe get this man a glass of water?idgaf. bernie is so fuckin boring. yang2020Joe: How is that legal?<br />Bernie: BECAUSE THEEYY MAAKKEEE THHEEE LAAAWWWSS<br />***LMAO, I thought he was gonna send Joe to his room without dinner.Luv it rep the 802he literally has very little logical answers but that wasnt a bad way to spend an hourHis lack of facts in regards to &quot;assault weapons&quot; really pisses me off.<br /><br /> Here are the facts,.... all rifles combined, including sport rifles or so called &quot;assault rifles,&quot; kill less people every year in this country then hammers or hands and feet.<br /><br />That&#39;s all rifles combined.<br /><br />And yet he wants to sit here and demonize rifles as if they are the problem.<br /><br />The fact that there are millions of rifles in this country and incidences like this are actually rare, not common. That  of itself is a Testament to the fact that the vast majority of people are responsible, and this is a rare occurrence.<br /><br />The United States today is massively less violent than it was a 100 or more years ago, even since the 90s... and I&#39;m so sick and tired of twisting the facts and manipulating the data to change perception and demonize something that is not the problem.<br /><br />He also says for some reason  unstable people aew walking around, that&#39;s because the left in this country insisted on closing the state run mental institutions and there&#39;s nowhere for these people to go.<br /><br />The United States has a lot less violent gun crime than many other nations on the planet. <br /> In fact, the vast majority of gun crime in this country is predominantly in the inner cities and gang related, and has nothing to do with a vast majority of gun owners in this country.<br /><br />You wanna get to the root of the problem? Started addressing the fact that only 6 to 7% of the country&#39;s population is responsible for up to 70% of homicide in this country as well as gun violence, and start figuring out how to target that demographic in the inner city and how to change around cultural perspectives so we don&#39;t keep repeating the same thing over and over.<br /><br /> I&#39;m so sick of turning a blind eye to what is sitting right in front of us and blatantly clear to anyone willing to open their  eyes all because it&#39;s not politically correct and it might offend somebody.Wow way to not ask him a legit question. Softballs and scripted answers all the way through. Terrible. I&#39;m not even a trump fan either.WTF just happened?!?! Tulsi had solutions, Andrew had ideas, what the f*ck was this diatribe piece of sh*t?!?!Within the first 3 minutes, Bernie subtly advocates for legislation giving the government the ability to control TV networks. Even in seemingly casual conversation, he drops wildly authoritarian ideas.Bernie I never had a real job Sanders.Feel the Bern 😊. He’s compassionate and lovely being.I’m amazed the comment section isn’t being overrun by Trump loyalists screaming about CommunismPretty pretty goodWe need to pass legislation requiring all candidates to do Joe Rogan. 🔥🔥Now I want to see him on “The Church of What’s Happening Now.”This was fantastic🤐It should have been Bernie &amp; Charlie Kirk, not to argue not to criticize, but to put opposition to some things that I think Bernie poorly explains. Bernie isn&#39;t good at getting his point across and I Joe I think could have questioned deeper.Bring trump on.I am so grateful I live in Canadanext, joe gotta get donald trump onPress him joe stop being soft like you were with twitter...He was frustrated by the time limit of the debate.... Joe would have given him hours and he sat for 1. Looks like the time constraint is his choice, not forced upon him. Tulsi spoke with Joe for 2 and half.I really hope he doesn’t become presidentGolden Rule of Economics.  There is no such thing as a free lunch! Bernie wants to give out free everything. The real question he has yet to solidify, how will we pay for these programs?Bernie and Yang run together 2020!Virtually free. Tell us the price.Guess what Bernie. If you needed heart surgery at your age in Canada you would die. You would be put on a waiting list and you would die because the younger people would come first. This is a known fact about healthcare in Canada. Canada also doesn&#39;t have free speech fyi.Japan, Bernie lolDisagree with a lot of this wholeheartedly, but he&#39;s a great guy and hard not to like him.  I&#39;ll vote for Andrew Yang before Bernie based on policy.  I was going to vote for Trump, but he&#39;s proven to be ignorant and impulsive the last few years and he&#39;s not for the 2A which i should have already known because he&#39;s a New Yorker. and he just signed his 2020 loss with his attack on video games like he&#39;s a 90&#39;s uninformed politician. That would shatter the economy  and is a completely unfounded belief that video games cause shootings. Actually proven to be uncorrelated. 5-10 million assault weapons and only a few a year are used to kill people. He said the military have fewer weapons than the citizens, good. That&#39;s the way it should be. Compare the amount of innocent people (collateral damage) that are killed by assault weapons each year by the military versus the citizens of America. True mass shootings are a statistical anomaly that would shatter a different portion of the economy by government regulation. <br /><br /><br />In Chicago last weekend, hospitals were turning away patients because of the massive influx of gunshot wounds. over 40 people shot in one city with one of the strictest gun control in the country, and that was just above the average. but i guess the left doesn&#39;t care about those victims. almost all or all of which were related to drugs/gangs. No news coverage. It doesn&#39;t fit the narrative. Ban assault weapons, whatever you determine that to be, probably doesn&#39;t include handguns, which are killing people 50x more than rifles.Damn...no UFC talk...off to pop some Palexia with an energy drink...Stop calling prison that propaganda name with that propaganda tone. <a href="http://qmap.pub/">Qmap.pub</a>Doesn&#39;t Bernie sound like George&#39;s boss from Seinfeld?Bernie represents the idea of true politics and what the president should do not just represent. Bettering the lives of all citizens not just those who are rich or look a certain wayBernie is a good dude.Bernie’s soft voice is creepy, he’s a card carrying communist who should be sent back to USSR or Venezuela.Why cant he comb his hair ???WE LOVE YOU BERNIE!!!I love Bernie but I gotta call bullshit on 1 thing. He is talking about pharma companies, mental health and drugs, yet his state banned kratom which is something that people use to get off a lot of different hard rx drugs.I never understood y u go threw bankruptcy n cant clear students loans smh something is going on&#39;Can&#39;t wait until Bernie sits in his rightful post..  Top cabinet member in the Buttigieg/Warren administration......Well if he&#39;s gonna let us know about the alien shit I&#39;m voting for him.Joe not as much pushback on some of his ideas. No real devil&#39;s advocate in this one. Nowhere near as good as the one with yang or gabbard. What a shameThis was a waste of a hour and seven minutes, Bernie didn’t answer not 1 question. All he did was tell “a story that he’ll never forget”. How can you change the medical care problem, “the people need to come together and pressure the nation” ... the pressure is suppose to be electing Bernie and that’s the answer, Bernie just admitted he doesn’t have the answerHe’s got my vote6000 clones of Jeff Bezos (that he himself made) downvoted Bernie.Democrats are economically illiterateWhy Jamie didn&#39;t Fact check any of the Bernie Sanders claim?Damnn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=26m00s">26:00</a> .... go follow my YouTube page so I can make into the middle classBernie for President!!!...I respect Bernie...but Andrew Yang has my vote!<br /><br /><br />Yang2020 <br />Humanity FirstTrump should do the podcastHealthcare is good, but Canadians also pay more in taxes than they do on living expenses. It&#39;s not free. You may pay tens of thousands in taxes towards healthcare and never need it. Likewise you may have paid no taxes, live on welfare, smoke 2 packs a day, have a bad meth habbit and are given healthcare on the backs of others labour. Certainly not a black and white issue.Damn Joe, you got Bernie!He seems like a nice guy, a really nice guy in fact. I just don&#39;t think he&#39;s a leader.I dont agree with many of his views but I respect his integrity.Why do idiots like Bernie and all the other &quot;health care is a Yuman right&quot; think that some people are entitled to other people&#39;s money and labor? Do you think smart people are going to continue going to college for so many years, interning for more, only to become a government employee with a government salary?Social media has more to blame then guns. Sup with that discussion?I&#39;m tired of this dude. Thank god this will be the last time he runs, and thank god he can&#39;t beat Trump.@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=14m39s">14:39</a> how would you stop that? 🥳👏🎊 Excellent question Mr. Rogan.  Okay Mr. Sanders, please step aside.  Let me take this one.<br />How do you stop any body from doing any thing?  Especially when it’s something they want to do?  You’ve got to make it so that the consequences outweigh the benefits.  Look, I don’t rob a bank because I don’t want to go to jail.   A company makes $50 billion in profit but does so by breaking the law or hurting people in the process, they pay $5 billion in fines and are good to go.  I can’t blame company’s and businesses for doing what they’re meant to do - they are there for one reason.  To make a profit.  So if a company makes $50 billion profit but they did so by breaking rules or laws or by violating moral or human rights, fine them $100 billion.  Period.  Make politicians fearful of  accepting bribes, make it absolutely terrifying for them to step outside ethical boundaries. <br />It’ll never happen though.  There’s too many measures in place that ensures that the current way of life will be the only way of life.  Even global warming doesn’t matter to these guys, why would it when it doesn’t effect them personally?  Especially when automation is pretty much here?  Smh.People are being crushed by the weight of their own bad decisions...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h07m08s">1:07:08</a> alien tidbitBernie!!! Woot woot! Finally someone that isn’t right wing or right wing leaning. HeyDamn, JRE has become BIGDoubt he will be president. He speaks to vague.I have never been in trouble with the law... But I&#39;ve been to the hospital for depression and anxiety... Can I have a gun Bernie? ... smhfix the mental problem in America first. going after the guns before that is fixed first then the crazy&#39;s will come up with far worst solutions to commit there act of large scale murderWoah!Looking forward to the Joe Rogan + Donald Trump episode.Ok now get a conservative to counter all the illogical giveaways with accounting realism. Free things sound good until all the companies go out of the country and noone has jobs anymore because we can&#39;t make profits due to taxes.Pay for it by understanding. THATS NOT A SOLUTION BERNIR THATS CALLED BULLSHIT.Get Gavin McInnes back on the show joeAmericas health care system is a joke. It disgusts me. To force people to have private health cover. To not supplement medications is a crime if you cant afford it you get sick and you die.Joe Rogan is the new Larry KingMajority of my views are conservative, but I’m happy to listen to Bernie. Podcast was great!This is really hard to sit thru. I cant tell if he is intentionally lying about shit, or if hes genuinely that retarded. Good for him for coming on tho. He even goes on fox. So, hes better than the majority of his compatriots, even if his ideas are atrocious.The root cause of most of the problems that were talked about isn&#39;t mental illness, or lack of schooling.  The root cause is a lack of quality Fathers in children&#39;s lives, particularly in the home.  It all starts at home, you need a strong family, then you need a strong neighborhood, then a strong community.The absolute mad man did it, before you know it he’s gonna have AOC. Wait... I take that back.... damnit it’s gonna happen isn’t it?Donald trump where you atWhy don&#39;t we try a program where you have to qualify with your &quot;assault&quot; weapon, go to the range, test out like in the military.  Government ran ranges.  I bet this would help weed out the weirdo&#39;s and killers.I didn’t go to college and I support a family of 5 on my own salary. My wife stays home with the kids. I live in a nice part of a big city. Stop going to university. Find what the market needs and go do that.God damn. Nothing but a bunch of socialist here. Pathetic.Has he tried DMT?give him some waterHow many think that hard working people won&#39;t quit their jobs if they are taxed to the amount it will take to cover a democratic socialist government? I know more than a few.This is very underwhelming.Bernie Sanders wants to tax people like Joe at 90%.This is the same guy who took a bribe from Hillary to keep his mouth shut about her cheating him out of the nomination. Must be enjoying his 3rd house. Bernie is a fraud.Please tell us about the aliens 👽 🙏Yeeeeeeees! Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1m06s">1:06</a> Absolutely Bernie!!!  Actually, today was the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere in all history of the earth.  <br />Climate Changeapocolypse is Real!!!As someone who lives in a european country that has ALL of the things that Bernie talks about (free healthcare, (almost) free higher education, stronger environmental protections etc) it baffles me to no end how so many americans actively vote against their own interests.<br />Or maybe im wrong and all of the downvotes on this video are multi-millionaires? <br />As an outsider who has no real bone in who you choose to rule over you like a god-emperor (except maybe for the fact that having a science denying president in one of the biggest countries makes climate change worse for the whole world) its plain to see that your whole political system and media is completely corrupted by money, and powerful greedy mega-corporations.<br />When the rare thing happens that a few honest, not bought and paid for politicians (like Bernie, Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang) manage to stand up in your rigged system, they almost immediately get torn down by your corporate media and the tribal partisanship of regular people.<br />Please America, make yourselves great and SANE again vote for people who actually give a damn about you and not the fat check theyre going to get from some lobbyist or mega-corp, the rest of the civilised western world needs america to be its true greatest partner again...<br /> For your sakes and the rest of the world.Enjoyed the discussion, but one of the major root causes of many of these issues involves the breakdown of the family, the town, the city, the country. You can give people all the opportunity and money you want, it will be pissed away!  <br />Two parent homes that value family,  community, the importance of education and discipline.  <br />It’s easy to fix our world, fix yourself!we will know what is in area 51 if bernie win !!!good job joe!This isn&#39;t related to anything discussed in the podcast but I think its one of if not THE biggest problem in America and many other places around the world. Including Canada and the UK.<br /><br /><br /><br />     We need to stop picking sides and acting like its a fucking football game. This whole idea of Left and Right needs to end, no one person has all the answers. Electing a leader should be based purely on their Ideals and policies not which party they side with. If this world is ever going to survive and make progress we need to stop this schoolyard bickering and come together to elect the right leader instead of arbitrarily picking a side. There are no winners or losers in the game of life, we&#39;re all in this together whether we like it or not.They should hold the debates exclusively on PBS!Joe should run for president, he’d probably win.Could not sit through his voice for the entire podcast, had to tune out after 15 min. Definitely Respect him for sitting down with JoeBernie I wanna give you my vote but I don&#39;t like that you want to take away employer paid healthcare :( I love my health plan and I don&#39;t want it to change please consider keeping the private industry around and creating a for all option as well. Thanks.I&#39;m not really educated about the concept of &quot;me too&quot; drugs, but I&#39;ve heard that antibiotics need to keep changing to keep up with bacteria and viruses developing new immunities. Is this why they tweak the drugs? And if not, how exactly does dumping money into tweaking drugs benefit the pharmaceutical company? Not saying he&#39;s wrong just wanna knowBest timelineGood job Joe, now it’s only fair to bring Trump.1 hour wasn&#39;t enough, corporate america and the elite are scared shitless of this jolly old manBERNIE Knows he cant want win he’s just taking the money he’s getting for campaigning.. look up how much he raised last electionJoe “I only platform right wingers” RoganHow Bern talking about rasising minimum wage when he doesn&#39;t even want to raise wages for his campaign employees he just cut hours... <br /><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-announces-it-will-cut-hours-to-pay-staffers-15-minimum-wage-prompting-mockery">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-announces-it-will-cut-hours-to-pay-staffers-15-minimum-wage-prompting-mockery</a>This video is going to have 15 million views.Thoughts and prayers in the face of tragedies like those in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ElPaso">#ElPaso</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Dayton">#Dayton</a> are simply not enough.

The Senate must act NOW. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EnoughIsEnough">#EnoughIsEnough</a>but senator have you ever tried DMT ?I am definitely for Yang, but Bernie Sanders has a great shot at being president and I would not at all be mad about it.So leftist terriost group antifa commits mass shootings and then the left tell us to have concessions on our 2nd amendment? I smell shenanigans....Here&#39;s my biggest problem with Bernie, and it starts around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=11m30s">11:30</a> mark. He urgently needs to divide the country into the haves and the have-nots and every other possible line of division he can find. He doesn&#39;t want a United States. He wants a DIVIDED States. &quot;Wealth&quot; and &quot;The Economy&quot; are not a zero-sum game. If they were, it would literally be impossible to have a GDP that is a positive value. If it was a zero-sum game, the best possible outcome would be that the economy next year would be exactly as large as this year because there would be no way to grow.<br /><br /><br />Sanders has ZERO comprehension of how the economy works, and that makes him incredibly dangerous. He&#39;s learned absolutely nothing from the failures of the USSR, Cuba, Venezuela, and every other failed socialist utopia. The government can&#39;t just set prices. Prices in a market are based on HUNDREDS of constantly changing factors that no one person or group of people could ever fully be aware of or be able to calculate on their own. Attempting to arbitrarily set these prices is what leads to the kinds of market failures that made Venezuela literally run out of toilet paper. The only bright side to that situation was that they had also run out of food, so they didn&#39;t really need the TP ... and if THAT&#39;s the bright side of socialism ... you know it&#39;s not a good idea!<br /><br /><br />Sanders has backed away from Venezuela lately because he can no longer pretend it&#39;s a paradise. It&#39;s a seaming crater, but before the total collapse he praised their system and said that we should learn from them. Now when people talk about his brand of socialism, he says, &quot;I&#39;m not talking about Venezuela!&quot; ... but you have to remember that he was for a very long time ... and look where that is now. If we follow him, that&#39;s exactly where we will end up.<br /><br /><br />Back to the point of the zero-sum game. Just because 1% of the people have a lot of money, that doesn&#39;t mean they have it because they have taken it away from everyone else. That&#39;s not how wealth and the economy work. People get rich by GIVING AWAY VALUE and making OTHERS richer. For example, person A has $1. Person B has 1 apple. Person A wants to buy an apple and is more than happy to buy one for $1. Person B isn&#39;t hungry and is more than happy to sell his apple for $1. They trade. Person A now has an apple that he valued MORE THAN he valued his $1, and person B has $1 that he valued MORE THAN he valued his apple. In this trade, BOTH participants walk away with MORE VALUE than they walked in with. Trade alone grew the value of the economy.<br /><br />Now imagine Person B has a billion apples. He sells those apples, and now he has $1B. He&#39;s a billionaire, but not because he bilked a bunch of people out of their money. He&#39;s rich because he GAVE people something they valued more than they valued their money. He voluntarily provided a service that made a billion people happy ... so why should he be demonized just because he&#39;s rich? This man is a HERO of the economy and society! This is how all free-market wealth is created.American politics: right-wing in fightingthis was awesome. as someone who didn&#39;t necessarily think like sanders, it&#39;s amazing he went on with a mule semen proponent.the actual swamp drainerThis guy has such pie in the sky utopian ideas and is completely out of touch with reality. Jesus Christ.YanggangPlease show Bernie the video of what a &quot;democratic socialist&quot; meeting looks like and you haven&#39;t seen it yourself please watch it before voting for this man. He&#39;s well intended but dangerously mislead.This is the modern rebirth of the Fireside ChatWish I could thumb this down more than once....I tried but I think I ruined my keyboard...Thanks you socialist pigEvery political candidate should be obligated to come to JREAnyone who believes Bernie is a fuckin fool! He actually said, &quot;billionaires spend billions to influence the Republican party and in SOME cases the democrat party&quot; lmaoYou ever compare features of your ex that you like better than that of your current partner in order to try to get them to change? That&#39;s Bernie rhetoric  in a nut shell.We fought wars against socialism, the Berlin wall was taken down because people were confined to socialism, Venezuela is in disarray because of socialism murdering their own and Democrats want to welcome it&quot;Joe is a gateway to the alt-right&quot;i just wanted to see bernie hit a blunt...Joe “I think imma vote for Bernie” RoganBernie, I&#39;m from Canada and yes we get free health care here but it&#39;s managed so badly that we can&#39;t even see a doctor unless we got to a private clinic. There are good hospitals here, but the lines are never ending. We&#39;re not without our problems here either. That being said, free healthcare and free aducation should be the foundation of a great society.When my Father got cancer he had to be flown to Vancouver Hospital in British Columbia, there he saw one of the best surgeons in the country for his specific type of Cancer. The surgery went well and the tumor was successfully removed. In total he spent nearly 2 months in the hospital for pre and post treatment. Not once was cost or money ever brought up. I can&#39;t imagine what its like for American families who are going thru some of the hardest and most trying times in their lives, dealing with a ill or dying family member and then on top of that scared about how they will be able to afford the proper and right treatment. Having to mortgage your house or take out a loan just to save your loved ones life.Wait you’re actually fucking kidding me?! You actually got Bernie Sanders on?! That’s hilarious Joe you got to get Trump on next!!Stop calling cannabis that propaganda name with that propaganda tone, eh. <a href="http://qmap.pub/">Qmap.pub</a>“I listen to scientists”, yeah like they never get it wrong or flat out lie 🤔State and Federal government cuts in education aren’t the reason that college is expensive.  It’s federally insured student loans.It&#39;s a sad day when we have socialists getting a platform in this country. People leave their failing countries to come to this country and it&#39;s not for the socialism dummiesShould of been Bernie vs trump 2016 great convo and good job joe for playing devils advocate and asking Bernie the hard questionsJoe I love your podcast even if this dum fuck Bernie  communist sandersDamnJoe, please, have him on again, and again. You might actually change the course of history and help make a better world for your girls and their future children. Please Joe have him on again.As much as I love Joe I cant even watch this.  I would lose too many brain cellsJoe “just put it a fist away from your face” rogantell me lies tell me sweet little liesTulsi vs. Bernie... I wish DNC would reveal their pre-chosen candidate so we dont waste votes again..You hear that coal miners?, he s not going to take your jobs away. But replace them with new safe jobs that would save the planet and your personal income . Ask Trump what happen to the coal miners in west Virginia?Perfect example of why I love JRE.You damn sure gotta take out your wallet for those taxes tht goes to pay for tht &quot;FREE&quot; healthcare . Fuck off bernietell me lies tell me sweet little liesHealthcare is not a human right it&#39;s a personal responsibility.I&#39;m not gonna waste my time but I would like to know how and why he let Hillary steal his electionHis only chance at the presidency was right here, but he didnt smoke with joeGet Trump on next?Holy shit! I never thought I&#39;d see Bernie Sanders on Joe Rogan? 😮tell me lies tell me sweet little liesYou should have smoked with him or maybe offer some DMT. He may have promised more &quot;free&quot; shit. Canadians that need to be seen by doctors come to the US for surgeries. The wait time is ridiculous. I would rather have better quality of care than free long waiting healthcare.i think of presidents as AOE buffsWhen is Trump going to be on?!?!?!Bernie / Hogan 2020Could you imagine the mindfuck of president Bernie Sanders coming on the Joe Rogan experience podcast to reveal to the world that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists.Anyone can talk good, wait till they get in the seat and have people telling them what they need to do and not what they said they would do.  I take him for face value, I can almost guarantee if he gets in office none of you fools will even recognize who he is.  And will be devastated that he bamboozled you. Just saying, name one other president that did what they said they would for the most part besides trump?! I&#39;ll wait......that why everyone is blown away never heard of it till now or seen so a president constantly trying to tackle issues.Bernie is a smart fella, but he caters to the far leftist ideology as well as contributing and pushing the smear narrative against President-Elect Donald J. Trump that he is a racist, sexist, and every other bad thing under the moon.How ever well intentioned, he is foolish on economics and I&#39;ll never forget how he rolled for Hillary..Communist is this the new Rome?AAAND BOOM, WE ARE LIVE!Joe “i’M pRo SeCoNd AmEnDmEnT” Roganhate his ideas but gotta say he coming across very well here. does not sound as loud and senial as he normaly does gained alot of respect for bernie the person hereつ◕_◕ ༽つ つ◕_◕ ༽つ つ◕_◕ ༽つWe need that spirit energy!!! Bring in Marianne Williamson  つ◕_◕ ༽つ つ◕_◕ ༽つ つ◕_◕ ༽つ つ◕_◕ ༽つThere’s so much about the Bernie platform that I agree with, and I see the overreaction to “socialism” but the one aspect of his and pretty much the whole Democratic party’s approach is elucidated upon by the election fundraising /debate cycle, and what y’all said about the lack of a fair opportunity to present each candidates case(positive attributes and qualifications) is exemplar of the actual problem in election politics and I’ll quote you Joe from the episode with A.Jones “the problem is we get on a team” if Bernie would take a true leadership role and suggest that the candidates voluntarily step back and refuse to compete for the presidential chair and take every opportunity to deconstruct the power and authority model that creates losers and forces resources into this massive waste of time which is the campaign trail and the bureaucratic institutional system which is the American government, I would stand in solidarity, I would bleed for a Leaderless America (I would never vote, unless it was on a per issue basis) he’s saying “it’s us not me” but he’s running for President &amp; Playing the power game. All the great Ideas in the world don’t negate the loss of benefit by the exclusion built into the system.<br /><br />Until we all realize that power is the problem and act accordingly I say “eh..let it Bern”<br /><br />LONG BITCOIN! Short the status quo!!!!I think it&#39;s only fair that he nominate Robert Lazar as head of the department of energy or transportation..Bernie said he would come on the podcast and talk about what they tell him about aliens if he becomes president. The memer vote regardless of political affiliation should be locked now, right?tell me lies tell me sweet little liesCrazy Bernie! He’s crazier than a bed bugI can&#39;t wait for Kamala Harris to come on and joe fires up a doobie!More guns than people? America! Fuck yeah! Hey Bernie, clearly define this term &quot;assault weapon.&quot; What caliber round does it fire? How fast does it fire? What sort of effective range does it have? What sort of scope does it have? Please embarrass yourself by trying to answer those questions ya goof.Props to Joe for having 3 candidates on his show this year.Well we learned nothing new. He wants free everything for everyone but has no real solutions, he wants to ban assault weapons even tho the ban in 1994 was completely ineffective gun violence was not changed statistically  and he doesnt like Trump. Save you the hour.MAGAWhite people ended segregation with black people.  It wasn&#39;t just black people racist Bernie.Bernie and Joe!!! Mind blownJoe &quot;All that jazz&quot; RoganBernie is literally my Senator...I voted for him...please just leave him here in the middle of nowhere where he belongs.  He is a greedy backhanded politician and he can&#39;t even pass the legislature he proposes here at home...and he&#39;s rich AF and goes on about how bad rich people are but if he was really about what he proposes he would be giving all his money to charity and not have more than 1 nice house.Public health care resolves most of the problem of living wages.  It will help prop us up  for the 4 year rollout of health care and then inflation, shelter, etc will start to support itself.Andrew Yang promises to permanently end homelessness by giving every American citizen $1,000 a month for the rest of their life.

A MAJOR presidential candidate just did your show for an hour.  Joe, this is HUGE.  FUCKING HUGE.  I mean,  do you realize you just entered territory that has never been entered before?  Barbara Walters only gets 20min of scripted questions.  Walter Cronkite didn&#39;t even get this kind of access to somebody like Bernie.  Now, was/is this a big Bernie commercial, maybe it was, I just dont care.  The simple fact that a MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE just did an hour long podcast with you just put your show in a whole new category.  Seriously, this is historical imo.  This just thrusted podcasts in general, much less yours, into the tier of serious journalism. This is what we need.  As the current mediums for political discourse are compromised by interests, THIS is the definition of grassroots.I completely disagree with the vast majority of Mr Sanders’ policies but I’m convinced that he’s a good man with fair intentions.I would like to hear some hard questions asked. For example - 911 disclosure? How would Bernie react (he is no fool, he knows it was inside job)?“They (Amazon) don’t pay taxes” <br /><br />Me: I agree Bernie, you’re right. <br /><br />“We need to tax them to death and make them pay their workers a minimum of $15 an hour and then redistribute their money to people that don’t work.”<br /><br />Dammit Bernie.How about a revolution......Got my voteFinally! The real deal.Having watched this podcast I cannot understand how anyone of sound mind would vote Bernie over Yang. Bernie is clearly a good man and he correct to point out the injustices built into the current political system. However his solutions in some areas are either sub-optimal or simply unclear. He was very strong on Medicare for all but very weak on minimum wage and how to extract cash from corporations paying $0, as well as college tuition.<br /><br />Come on Bernie bros. I get it. He’s a great guy. But it’s not cliche to say that he is trying to solve 21st century problems with 20th century solutions. Please look again at Yang. And if you view Yang as some libertarian out to gut the poor please stop watching Michael Brooks and check Yang’s resume.I predict more politicians dropping bySame old stuff. Just because you go to college free or paid doesnt mean jobs will be there. Yang the only one that has spoke about what we are going to do about AI and automation<br /><br />Also Williamson is the only 1 that has said we need to do more about why people are having health issues in the 1st place instead of just focusing on not being able to afford health care drugs.Bernie: &quot;Bs, Bs, yada yada, blah blah, bs, bs&quot;.Someone think of the children!!!God damn it just pisses me off listening to this jackass. Damn it Rogan. He is going to take your .223 rifle to hunt. He doesn&#39;t say a damn thing. Oh I love the 2nd amendment, but we have to make concessions. Talking out of both sides of his mouth.Respect to Bernie for going on the show. He&#39;s still a whacky socialist, but respect anyway.&quot;Kamala didn&#39;t have enough time to answer Tulsi Gabbard&quot;<br /><br />WTF Joe there was nothing she could say to deny it, she is a piece of shit.I trust Bernie... but i don’t trust the Democrats. Most democrat-run states are shitholes with the highest corruption (most money at the top) and the lowest self-reported quality of life, plus highest crime, strictest laws, and most homeless. <br /><br />The democrats are evil, imo. Bernie should be independent.I honestly lost count of the number of lies,  half truths, and completely insane comments this man made and he went completely unchecked.  Joe, if you are truly balanced, Bernie won’t be your only presidential candidate as a guest. If so, I’m out.3 minutes in and he’s talking about government forcing networks to work for free lol. Who’s gonna pay them? Directors, producers, cameramen, security guards? It’s all free lolBernie is humble, yes.  Bernie is authentic, yes.  He is authentically socialist.  Please read up on socialism and what it means.  What the Democratic Socialists of America really want.  Its not simply to use free markets to get rich and provide welfare....they want to radically change the economic model of the USA.All joe question are scripted NEVER challenge bernie in any point  ... SAD ... and patheticWhat a pussy joe! 271 mass shootings??? Wtf? You know damn well that number is bullshit. A guy blowing away his wife and the guy she is cheating with isnt a mass shooting!!!Incredible interview, i&#39;m voting for BernieBoth sides of my personality are extremely pleased with this ! Thank you  Joe!But when does he hit the joint?I like Bernie. But he knows fuck all about the difference between &quot;assault&quot; weapons and semi-automatic weapons.Bernie is a GD Liar!!!I wish Joe would&#39;ve asked if he thought Trump was a racist.Fuck YESDid he really just say he wants free medicare for older individuals and they want everyone to pay for it? Aren&#39;t they already getting social security while the younger generation is paying for it + getting none of it? These boomers just want free stuff without paying for it. smh<br /><br /><br />and the problem with raising minimum wage is that the companies WILL raise their prices, rather than losing profit, which will cause EVERYONE to pay more for everything, even the people the didn&#39;t have the wages raised. It&#39;s just a way for companies to make more moneyAlso not a Bernie fan, but as soon as I saw the thumbnail I knew it would be amazing! I appreciate him for doing this, and I&#39;d wager he&#39;s going to take leaps and bounds for doing so...<br /><br />Prepare to see more candidates following suit...Free healthcare + open borders = instant destruction of our countryHa he couldn&#39;t answer on the cost of college education now compared to years ago  after his long winded point..typical politician winging it..God Bless USAThis dude can have a legit conversation, I believe he means what he’s saying and isn’t influenced by corporations, he has the welfare of the majority of the American people in mind and the world population in terms of climate change. Somebody who wants to help humans, that’s cool as hell to me.I have abstained from voting the past two elections. Your right to abstain from voting is equally important as casting a vote. I will not vote for someone I dont not wholeheartedly support. That being said, Bernie has my vote.I disagree with Bernie on alot but its good joe had him onJoe, big props for having Bernie on!!400 and something billion dollars from drug companies yet the nra is the problemI really hope Bernie wins the election; greetings from Germany :)Cite me a single expert, Bernz. You&#39;re awful close to Quebec, why not go check out our shithole hospital system?He&#39;s right when he says he doesn&#39;t have all the answers.  but one or two complete answers would be niceRandall Carlson Eddie Bravo Alex Jones Dave Smith Ari, and Bernie. Uncle joey for the last 30 min.Bernie, what is the hurdle? <br />money/power?<br />u have been in government so long and not done ship, why do u have to be the president to get anything done? being a presiden u will have less time to do things and no focus!<br />u r the presiden of ur presidential run.. and u can even give them health care program, u critize the people because they went public... why can&#39;t people look at this guy for the fraud he is....<br />what is wrong with u people.Wow, if I didn&#39;t know that he doesn&#39;t take care of his own employees and I wasn&#39;t a total gun nut who actually researches gun laws and statistics. I would fall for the B.S.Only 1 hour?BERNNNNNN!!!!!!  Let&#39;s change this bitch already. Help lead us.we need assault weapons for when the aliemz come to steal our fossil fuels you basturdWhat he says and what he does are 2 different actions. Knowing from the last election ,and how easily people forget he&#39;s owned and controlled by deep state swamp aka lobbyistsHes sooo full of shit. He does not care about destroying small businessesHow many times does Bernie hit the nail on the head in this interview? The American people are being raped and they don&#39;t even see itShit, man. Thanks for doing this Joe. I think this is important.Drugs are 10% of healthcare costs. Want to lower healthcare costs? Target the other 81%. Hospital care is 33% of all spending. 20% is doctor &amp; clinical services. Target those if you want to lower healthcare costs.

Don’t care what party.Bernie Sanders is an embarrassment - I will never forget him endorsing Hillary Clinton at the DNC. He&#39;s simply not the stuff leaders are made of.IM STILL WITH THE YANG GANGhealthcare is far more complicated than anybody thinks. free sounds great but then the insurance companies and hospitals will literally be able to decide who is granted care over others which in turn will end up being a major race issue turning into a disaster. plus it is NOT FREE. is is simply adding more taxes. rich pay 40%. Mid pay 30%. Lets add even more tax where people will feel like they are being stripped of life already. ALL BAD.Yippe kayak mother bucketsGood ole Joo Rogaine....promoting the cream of the crap of the biggest scams in the businessJoe does it again. First he sucks off Jack Dorsey, now he gives Bernie Sanders a shameless plug. Joe knows that pharmaceutical companies spend inordinate amounts of money on research and their people cost a fortune to train. Bernie is campaigning on handouts. And unemployed millennial idiots who don’t know any better think voting for Bernie will get them out of their student loans. Bernie is a fucking scam artist. Instead of voting for him, follow Dave Ramsey on YouTube and get your shit together.People:<br />Joe Rogan Experience: Jesus ChristHe cant explain how the trillions of dollars he intends to spend won&#39;t cripple the entire world&#39;s economyThe issue I have with taking away big corporations tax breaks it would also take away from small business owners tax breaks as well. Without those tax breaks more thsn 50% of all small businesses would go out of businessEvery one of his talking points are crap.man, he is on fire rn! its so cool seeing all the recognition hes getting :) gives me hopethis is what the truth sounds likeFuck this guy!!!Damn.AaHUGE!God bless this man, thank you for fighting for equality and the betterment of mankind Bernie.EVERY presidential candidate should go on The Joe Rogan Experience. It isn&#39;t just a platform for the candidates, more importantly a one stop shop to vet the very candidates we support or don&#39;t.Did he ask for half of your weed?Love all these candidates in office 30 years who have all the answers to problems they created.WHO RUNS THE DRUG COMPANIES!? OY VEY SO RADICAL!Dammit Joe. You just let him slobber for a hour and never pushed back. Why didn’t you ask him about PC culture? Smells like you agreed to terms before handBernie going to lose 2 elections before Kanye podcast drops<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />isa jokeJust downloaded this for my morning drive. Why would it only be an hour long? I would have thought they&#39;d have hours of discussion.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=19m55s">19:55</a> Thats there own fault Bernie. Amazon just showed you what happens when you put minimum wage goes to $15. They cut the bonus incentive for good workers that work harder at there position and reduce hours for those workers. What then are you going to try and do. Force a company to have a minimum of 7 hour work days for each employee. OK! Well now you have even less people working because of that forced rule that you want to implement. The power a person has over on a company is the decision on whether or not they want to stay with that company and offer them a price there willing to employ them. If the company will not pay the individual the price they are asking, then the employee moves on somewhere else where they think a employer will see there worth to the company.Imagine Alex Jones on this podcastWhen bernie is whispering it is a normal person yelling, just image his hay daywell this just made my fucking day. Go Bernie!!Bernie Rogan 2020Bernie see problems but has weak/non solutions. “Corporations don’t pay taxes because have power we need to take it away.” Ummm, OK sure and what does that look like exactly? I’ll go with Andrew Yang “You get corporations to pay their fair share with a VAT.”shortest interview ever.All pergect except bad take on mental health and gun violence. These shootings are perfectly rational given the fascist ideologies these idiots are adopting and promoting. As for mental health, its not a fucking mystery. Capitalism is a thing.Bots are flooding the chat.I screamed like a 60&#39;s teenage girl about the Beatles when I saw the title.Is Joe still considered Alt-Right Adjacent?If you want to own a GUN...... we (millionaires in the the government) need to know that you&#39;re ok.Joe the socialist, Bernie the guy that’s never held a real job in his life Sanders.thanks, very informative .The 2nd amendment means you shall possess the same weapons as the military.Side note: <b>his voice is really soothing.</b>Now get Trump onSo happy Bernie is finally on, a long platform for him to express himself very beneficial for his campaign! Some good candidates coming up, let’s make sure we listen to them all and make a proper decision. 🤷🏽‍♂️ I hope everyone is having a good fucking night listening to this.. 🙏🏽Joe:  So minimum wage.  What do you do with companies that wont be able to stay open if they suddenly have to pay 15 dollars an hour?<br /><br />Bernie:  Well all companies would be shouldered with the same burden so...<br /><br />Me:  YEAH?? AND!? They all go out of business?!  They all raise their prices?!  &quot;Life sucks for everyone&quot; isnt a good answer Bernie!Was waiting for some &quot;queens&quot; to steal the mic.Hey Joe, I have really been wanting you to hold your own debates in long form with some of the candidates such as Bernie, Tulsi and Andrew :)Drain the Swamp 2.0Awesome1hour + of Brooklyn thug UNCENSOREDJoe is gonna have a time machine and bring on some next level guests within our life time if he keeps this up :D<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m18s">23:18</a> Bernie be like, are you high right now, Joe?So, some of you out there help me to understand this, please. If the vast amount of shootings happen with a handgun, why is Bernie wanting to ban rifles? It seems to me that if you are really wanting to help people, you take away the instrument that commits the most damage, right? And rifles, of military OR civilian design, aren’t in the catagory of “most weapon used” by a really long shot.The reason why people can’t go to college is because the dollar isn’t backed by gold. Smh common broKFCSame thing as the drug companies. Thanks Bernie.  Support trumps ideas. Hit the drug companiesOnly ten minutes in. I wonder what will happen if open borders is going to get brought up or any hot button issue. I&#39;m doubting it, I think Bern is going to play it safe and Joe ain&#39;t going to press some of those issues.i dont blame inanimate objects. i blame the news media outlets that cause all this hatred,  when they lie and make shit up about people being racist,  and playing certain sound bites to get people all riled up and pitted against each other.  all the liberal bullshit pumped into the minds of our children making them soft, putting them on pharma drugs, and trying to change how people naturally are.The ONLY real candidate and the ONLY candidate who can take on Trump.  Please everyone get on board with this man.  The dnc itself is trying to divide people against Bernie because he is the truth and it terrifies dems and Republicans.Honestly a little disappointed.  Joe didn&#39;t really drill into any specifics about policy and really let Bern speak in generalities like &quot;I&#39;ll rally everyone around these issues.&quot;  Ok, one obvious follow up question would be, how?Joe should do a podcast with Trump lolMost mass shooters are mentally depraved, but to equate mass shooting with madness misses the mark, its the madness of the set of options and information that individuals are dealt by power that can cause a mass shooting, just as madness can, just as a well calculated decision can. What causes mental depravity Joe?Of course his last question is about aliens what a love I have for you and your show me. Rogan. Thank you much :)Joe embracing his true socially liberal economic leftist policies... finallyJoe how could you have a “SOCIALIST “ on your show? Very upsetting to a LOT of your viewers!!!Chiner &amp; RussierWooow I can&#39;t believe I missed this. Darn, when I&#39;m busy <b>THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS</b> seriously...trashit almost sounds like american drug companies are... cartels. i mean when even politicians are afraid of them, something&#39;s upPodcasts are the NEW non-syndicated TV network. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ThankYou">#ThankYou</a> Joe for all you do to prove me right!Good man Bernietax everything and everyonePimp Joe podcastBernie Sanders never built anything, he&#39;s a lifelong politician.Putin and Xi are dictators??? Wtf Bernie. That&#39;s ignorance and bad resume for you to be the top diplomat of the US.After 9 minutes I could feel I was getting dummer after minutes. Had to stop🤣.Was waiting for Joe to light up one of those Tyson blunts so I could hear Bernie ask, &quot;So is that a joint?Americans are acting like fucking pioneers not realizing that they&#39;re 100 steps behind other 1st world countries like germany, canada or the netherlands. right now you&#39;re making fools out of yourself with all these mass shootings killing your kids or those ridiculous health care problems. Stop acting like pussies and start looking at other countries. &quot;oH i WoNder wHy TheSe PsyChos ArE AbLe tO kiLL ouR poOr inNoceNt chiLdren?? 🥺 hoW caN We cHanGe tHat iT&#39;s impOsSiBLe!!&quot; <br />no it&#39;s not, just compare the stats and you&#39;ll realize the problem are the GUNS!! what a huge surprise!I found it funny how he went from &quot;man&quot; to &quot;sir&quot; lel it seems to me like Bernie really does understand what we have to do as a people in order to make our government work for all of us. And his role as president would be to organize that political revolution. Kool stuff.fuck Bernie, get Barry&quot;I just had Bernie on and he said...&quot; - Joe on the next 10 episodes or soBig Pharma own AmericaBernie knows basically nothing about guns... Or any statistics on links to “gun show purchases” and shootings... <br /><br />Your basic deer rifle is more powerful then an AR-15... And many pistols have capacities that are comparable...<br /><br />There is not one answer to this... <br /><br />Restricting guns will do NOTHING...I mean, the whole show was about that last question. Fingers crossed :)Donate a few bucks to Bernie’s campaign you cheap asses!!!!!!!!!!!!Bernie’s too old for this! it is not even 2020 and he’s gasping for air, Just horrible!I’m not opposed to any of his points per se, but more the execution of it, and how one dimensional some people make it seem. Free healthcare and education for example. What would the doctors salaries be dwindled to, and would it be enough to still incentivize people to go through all those years of school? Is college free up to a bachelors? Or is it higher? If he passes all this stuff and can’t get wall street to pay for it, it’ll have to come down to the people. I wouldn’t be able to afford my house. IL taxes are already crazyGet Trump on and have Alex Jones jump out of nowhere.The corporations hate him for this one simple trickJRE should host the debates... 🤯🤯took Yangs line and ran with it, im excited that he&#39;s on bernie&#39;s radar =)Trigger the Repubes bernie ! Make them cry by treating their kids better then they ever will, with health care &amp; schoolingJRE should go full Goggins in pursuing the goal of hosting the first long-form presidential candidate debates on the JRE.Mxpx franco unamericanIf you’re that idiot going in 100k in student debt you deserve to crash and burn fuck that I shouldn’t pay shit for your educationI like what hes saying about everything on the podcast, but Im not liking his opinion on opening the borders for more people even though there are already millions of people in poverty in our country.Why the lack of eye contact? 👀 Is this always his style when sitting across from someone?Joe Rogan needs to put the Don on his showGet Trump on and do DMT togetherBernie &quot;i spoke to a person&quot; SandersGreat last question Joe lolBernie: Blah...Healthcare, Blah...Guns, Blah...Blah...Prison Population...Gotta Go... I&#39;ll be on the Breakfast Club Tommorow!!!<br /><br />JRE Stans: Can we talk about something new?SocialismBernie complaining about high drug prices while Trump is already working on allowing drug imports to compete with domestic pricing.AnecdotalBernieBernie going on this show did it right.. I hope it helps. I’m a victim of the drug company empire. I’m registering and voting for the first time in my 30 years now.Ideally wouldn&#39;t private doctors negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for drug prices so that open and free competition would still exist rather than government having that negotiation and mandating the price across the board...I get that with doctors in this day and age, the quality of the care won&#39;t fluctuate much because it is very good with modern equipment, but you can still see how the conservative argument works better.  Isn&#39;t it extremely irresponsible to have kids when you work at Mcdonalds and earn so little?  <br /><br /><br />Joe with his, &quot;why is it legal&quot; repeat phrase in the beginning...weak bruh, your arguments are weak. The idea of a free education is a JOKE, young adults with any semblance of drive, inspiration, and creativity all end up LEAVING secondary education...give it to everyone and it&#39;ll be worth nothing. An elite education loses all value when everyone&#39;s accepted...27 minutes in and im out for now.Joe has done more for  Americans than this guy...  his only policy is hating rich politicians...yet he&#39;s a rich politician.Fuck this &#39;sweet old man&#39;. <br /><br />A $15 MW only hurts the young, women, minorities and small businesses by rendering them all uncompetitive. Only big corporations who can afford to pay will benefit from this. <br /><br />He&#39;s a fraud.Did someone rub a balloon against his hair?I would rather have had Larry David, as Bernie Sanders. Now that is an interview to watch.Joe Rogan has so much clout now. He&#39;s bigger than STERN and LARRY KING combined. A new King of media has arrived!How about marianne williamson?????Get Trump on. That would be so easy, he is best friends with DanaThank God this crazy man will never be President of The United States of America. Remember ladies, he thinks you all fantasize about 3 men raping you when you&#39;re making sweet sweet love to your man.The poorest states vote republican. Change my mind.Joes only a good interviewer today cause his handler and jack dorsey told him toYou will have Bernie but not Sam Hyde?All plans need to begin with a strong familyI never laughed at Perot....This is probably the most Leftist person Joe will have on, ever.You guys need to get warrior one gun store owner in for a interview <br />Marine veteran <br />See his opinion on the crisis going on today in the USHe doesn&#39;t wanna take your money. He just wants to control every aspect of your life. I wanna this... I wanna that... who pays for it you sly commie? So some people somewhere made millions, we need to tax everyone at a 70% rate, but hey... you get free shitty healthcare.Rogan, i think a think tank hosted by yourself would be of great service, bernie sanders, elon musk, eddie huang, andrew yang.......you pick em.Amazon gave that raise and took away all their retirement shit healthcare benefitsCool to see Bernie on this show. He has a lot of different ideas very few solutions. My bigger concern as if he were to win the presidency what would he get done?  He has been and politics for long time, never managed to get a single bill through.  That does not bode well.Exactly what a demagogue and tyrant would do sacrifice millions annoyance of innocence because 0.001% of the population is going to do something bed. Barney said it himself 99.999% of all gun owners would never think of doing anything badd. While hes right but you know what it must the funk those 99.999 99% of people because the 0.000001% of people might do some harm. Typical government move, Strip away everybody&#39;s freedoms because of a few bed apples. Besides nobody wants to mention that these killings could have easily taken place without assault rifles. These killings could easily have been done using hang guns or shot guns..  blame the guns they say.  Yea and im gonna blame my spoon for making me fat.  Maybe if the Gov would stop mandating vaccines and allowing big pharma to deug our children, and government got out of our way and gave us our souls back maybe the discord and all the reprisal would stop...You think that student debt is strictly related to college expenses?  Do you know how many people I saw blowing their student loan money on nights out, food and countless other items ? Many people were issued money with no recourse on what they purchased! Then you want to take away access to the same guns our military has access to even with due diligence on the buyer?  How are we supposed to be able to protect ourselves from this government like our founding fathers originally insisted? Final thought: Why not cut the resources on locking up marijuana users and fund your tax campaign on Wall streetSorry old man, rule #1 about sincere conversation is eye contact. You can’t fake that.I’m happy he’s at least not intent on being an autocrat (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=15m50s">15:50</a>)Eddie bravo was sharing negative memes about Bernie on his insta lol joe is more progressive then rich minoritiesJoe Rogan is a sheppie controlled media by the elites. Mario Lopez without hair!after bernies first statement i thought its another andrew yang joe rogan podcast!<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>I thought he was kind of crazy and im not to smart to understand politics a lot but anyway miszer bernie seems like a good person, maybe he really wants to be helpfull either do its to difficult to do anything in politics.<br />Wish him good health and everything good in life, cheers from europe!This is why I love jreWe need to know, did you beat up your wife?  11i. Have you committed crimes?  11b,c,d, e, g, h, and i.  What&#39;s the state of your mental health? 11f.  These are literally already covered by the federal form 4473 every FFL is required to have someone fill out when purchasing a firearm.   We need to make it universal.  That form is legally required in all 50 states for FFL dealers.  If a dealer goes to a gunshow, which most of the sales at a gun show are from FFL holders, they still have to do a background check in all 50 states.  It is still illegal to knowingly sell a firearm to someone who cannot legally possess it.  It is most certainly illegal to purchase a firearms with the intent to sell said firearm.  It is a straw purchase.  Only valid point he made here was that a private sale of a firearm is legal in a lot of states and doesn&#39;t require a background check, but there is still a paper trail and you can still be charged for furnishing a handgun to a felon. &quot;Assault style weapon&quot; is a dangerous term because it is vague as hell for the sake of being expanded on later down the line.  You can&#39;t have my AR-15 today because I won&#39;t let you have my Mini-14 tomorrow, or my BAR MKIII the day after that.And I know I know yall could give two fucks but if anyone had a backbone they would stand up and show what&#39;s right and not let old communist pieces of shit even get close to the whitehouseWho thinks America is the greatest country on earth?✊✊✊ GO, JOE!The state of JRE:  <br /><br />- No longer live<br /><br />- Joe is reading the fucking questions supplied by Sanders.<br /><br />I used to love this podcast. 😔What. And . The . Actual. Fuck.Joe PLEASE Becareful of the liberal pathogens!!! You don&#39;t need ratings this bad!!!! DISINFECT!!!!I was a Republican 4 years ago, then I saw someone that didn&#39;t represent or care about me get elected president.  I hope to be voting for Bernie in 2020.  He&#39;s the most authentic politician I&#39;ve ever seen.COULDN&#39;T CARE LESS!!!!If Bernie wins and makes everything free who will pay for it?Trump next?<br />Everyone that is gushing over Bernie missed the boat on the real player in breaking up the fed. Everyone turned their back on Ron Paul somehow all fell in love with Bernie? RP’s plan to fix healthcare beats the hell out of Bernie’s.Everything is to late student debt 😂 so many people are in debt they want an ewuwl balance of different classes that will never change.our true president had Killary not cheated.....just sayinBernie 💋💪🏽BERNIE REALLY SAID &quot;PERIODT&quot; HOT GIRLS SUMMER UP 10 POINTSSorry Joe, not listening to this quack.Most guests get 2-3+ hours.  Why does Bernie only get an hour?Within almost every answer Bernie says &quot;I don&#39;t have the answer&quot; loli think joe should interview all the presidential runnersWhat a god damn legend! If America doesn&#39;t want him, we&#39;ll have him down in Australia.I’m going to say one thing and it will describe this piece of shit as a whole. Complains about global warming and is totally up for taxing everyone for emissions, yet drives a $200,000 Audi R8... because their policies are the poor people can’t do it only the elites... anyone that votes for this blatant idiot deserves what comes right after....Now do Donald Trump :-)Holy ShitTulsi is pissed right nowDidnt he lose the last election?Its kinda sad how exciting this is 2 see. I really think this podcast is changing the world. Or atleast it&#39;s changed my world. Thanks to Joe and every1 who makes this show possible!What bernie FAILED to mention is that on canadas healthcare system you are more likely to die from a bad heart than getting fast treatment. US isnt free but its fast and the BEST you can get.Joe shows his true colorsIf Joe Rogan hosted the debates they would be afraid to get out of lineWith Bernie We Sand.He tells the truth and speaks too much of it, thats gonna get him killed <br />Same reason they killed jkf and mlkJoe didn&#39;t know that the US had the privilege of being the one country with lobbyistshow does this have such a high proportion of dislikes. He is just stating his views. Why dislike the video because someone said something you disagree with.should of had alex jones on with him and got them all high.i don’t agree with Bernie on several of his policy proposals (e.g. $15 minimum wage, free college, unspecified climate change action/lack of nuclear power consideration) but thoroughly enjoyed hearing his perspective on various issues via long-form convo.<br /><br />great interview. still like Yang and Tulsi more - but will vote Bernie if he’s the only option against Trump.Its a trip when you realize how far Joe has come. Who would have guessed the Fear Factor guy would have a better platform for presidential candidiates to discuss the country&#39;s issues than the big TV channelsGreat great great show...fucking loved every minute.  @JoeRogan has the best format for people to speak about real issues.no fucking way...as a person looking at american politics from the outside i find this guy to be much more sane than trumpNews flash Bernie, In order to make Steel we need Coal, China likes our coal, so lets make coal GREAT AGAINI’m all for giving candidates a platform...but that old fart doesn’t have a chance in hell. All the Bernie fans have jumped ship to the yang gang 🙄 “free shit” is always popular with morons. free shit = taxes = YOUR MONEY.Cant have open borders and free health care bernie! Cant have both without 1 world order.Only an hour? Socialism really does take half away 😂15$ minimum wage would cause companies to raise prices. So who is paying for these peoples raise? Well you would be,in every single way, with every single purchase. You are literally stealing from yourself and claiming you&#39;re doing good for people.&quot;PaY tHEiR fAiR shArE.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What is your fair share of what someone else worked for?&quot;<br />-Thomas Sowell<br /><br />Tell me, what is YOUR fair share of the Federal income tax burden? Because nearly 50% aren&#39;t paying THEIR fair share...When he talks about Medicare for all - would that include reimbursing all the money that current members paid in throughout their entire working life - so that everyone would start the new program on an even state?You  know the last guy to demonize the 1% and offer a &quot;solution&quot; to take their money away and give it to the people....was Hitler.Bernie  speak the eff up dude you whisper into the microphone for over half of this interview.  Where is the Bernie from the campaign trail?&quot;In Canada, you can see any doctor you want.&quot;<br /><br />No, I can&#39;t. Finding a doctor taking new patients is extremely difficult. We rely on walk-in clinics and ERs for care, and it sucks.This is such a surreal episodeThe colleges put the cost on the students? The Government GUARANTEED the loan. The schools didn&#39;t have to accept any liability or loss; it was all placed on the student. And now we have tuition over a thousand percent that what it used to be. So how does Bernie propose to fix an issue the government clearly had a LARGE hand in creating? By canceling all the government loan debt and forcing colleges to what... use tax payer dollars to further subsidize education? <br /><br />The free market would have forced colleges to adjust to both consumer demand and consumer ability. But instead you decided to throw money at a problem hoping it would go away without realizing you created an even bigger one. Now we have tens of millions of dollars in specific departments ALONE, and salaries for administrators as high as HALF A MILLION PER YEAR and TRILLIONS in loan debt. <br /><br />And your illustrious goal... to fix this issue... is to wave a magic wand and make all that money disappear? You can&#39;t fix over spending by spending more! Ironically, you could learn that by taking an econ class; which also funny enough, people can&#39;t afford to do because the government artificially inflated the costs by telling everyone they&#39;d pay for it!<br /><br />Don&#39;t spend a god damned dime UNTIL you level out and stabilize all the issues you have with tax generation. Otherwise all you&#39;re doing is promising free shit on someone else&#39;s credit card.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=41m22s">41:22</a>Every idea you mentioned supported by majority of America people . HELL NO THEY ARE NOT.When is Trump coming on&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;??????!!!!!Why is this important interview not trending on YT, while a freak in drag teaching how to apply makeup is?!GOOD GOOGLY MOOGLYCouldn&#39;t have been a more predictable and uninteresting interview. Bernie Sanders is terrible in every way, and his ideas are even worse. Thumbs down.Bernie is the guy for 2020. Hope he gets the nomination. Too bad this is only an hour.God why u get this ancient bumbling faggot on here.. wtf.. this last fucking waste of internet space I&#39;m watching from JRE...25% of a multimillion dollar transaction is a lot in tax and a multitude of transactions like that happen daily gtfoh Bernie jack ass sanders!First time I’ve ever scrolled down JRE’s comments and seen all positivity.YESSSSSSSSSSGIVE ME YOUR MONEY<br />IM GANNA GIVE IT TO THE BLACKSExciting guest I hope he gets other candidates on as well gives them time to explain themselves and not only clarifies what they say but also allows people to make a more complete critique of the people&#39;s positions since the candidate can&#39;t use the excuse that they didn&#39;t have enough time to explain properly, love the work Joe Rogan does. Having candidates on for various podcasts rather than debates would probably make political discussion more healthy since it would discourage the gotcha trend that is so prevalent right nowYou want to stop mass shootings by taking assault rifles away from our law bidding citizens <br />Your going start a civil war there&#39;s going to be mass shootings on every door step of every home in America that the government comes to trying to confiscate our assault rifles <br />Dumb ass DemsIn 2000 Joe Rogan wants to kill a guy over 50% tax.... today millionaire Joe Rogan doesn&#39;t care about taxes... yes, thanks bro.... the rest of us working class guys DO care. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rememberyourroots">#rememberyourroots</a>Bernie and Andrew Yang seem to see many of the same issues with jobs being eliminated/automated. One is for raising the minimum wage, the other is for UBI. Which one can realistically be implemented quickly with their intended benefits is the question.Health care in Canada is a provincial jurisdiction. I don’t believe we have a national health system. Please correct me if I’m wrong.Sounds like Bernie wants healthcare for him and his friendsProps Joe, this is EXACTLY the political discourse we need in this country!!! You have an amazing platform that doesn’t have left or right bias. Let the candidates put their ideas on the table so America can decide.Gret Idea Bernie.... this was a brilliant strategy... and Thank you Joe... for hosting.Trump 2020Yeah, that&#39;s right, Bernie! Those damn crooks on Wall St. Damn them! Investing in businesses! It&#39;s like this man doesn&#39;t understand what investment is and he just played a game of Monopoly and thought: Yeah, this isn&#39;t right!ty joe keep having the real candidates on tulsi/marianne/bernie/yang fuck the establishment&quot;That&#39;s what greed is all about!&quot;<br /><br />Not letting the government take money that YOU earned? I guess I&#39;m greedy...<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s legal because THEY MAKE THE LAWS!&quot;<br /><br />No, Senator Sanders, YOU as a legislator make the laws.You are all brainwashed! GO TRUMP 2020 Open your GOD Damn eyes and do some real research. Don&#39;t let the media or joe&quot;agenda&quot;rogan dictate your thoughts! GO TRUMP GOYes the movements had helped but it also has been fixed or healed lil to all over time. But it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s the constant stand and interest in that subject and as much as ppl including myself know it&#39;s wrong but let it go after so long because of other things that come around. And news and other companies are Great at redirecting ur concerns.UnsubbedGet Trump onBurnie is crazy old man.... You&#39;re not taking my ARdude is the man, america politics and &quot;tv&quot; news.. are against him.  he would be good for america.. specially 2 years ago.First two minutes: Yeah debates are BS nothin but 45 second sound bites.<br />Next 58 minutes: 45 second sound bites.Awesome show Joe! Thanks!I have a hard time feeling bad for “the working class.” I’m the working class. I enjoy my job. I paid my dues. I take care of my health and my family is secure because I put in the time to study instead of party, exercise instead of doing drugs, and starting a home business—working 70hrs a week until i succeeded—instead of picking a senseless corporate job that I don’t enjoy. <br /><br />No one needs to feel bad for me or pay my bills, nor do i want to help you repay your debts for you poor choices. 🤷🏻‍♂️FREE FREE FREEWhere is Jamie?\Feel the BernWhat I like about Bernie Sanders is it seems that even if you disagree with his ideology, it&#39;s hard to deny that he cares about United States citizens and does what he can to help the American people. I wish we had more politicians like him despite political parties or ideologies. Politicians who actually care about the American people, not only abstract ideologies.The problem with higher education is it’s not really a free market. They know students will get a federal student loan, the colleges universities and other educational facilities only have a vested interest in helping students get the loans. They get paid the students get a “ education “ and out the door for the next class. The colleges and universities need to give a guarantee that students who get a real education will find work capable of paying back any debt and get the federal government out of higher education no money from the feds.༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ DELANEY 2020༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ DELANEY 2020Joe: how do we stop mass shootings, school loan debt and healthcare.<br /><br />Bernie Sanders: bigger government, bigger government and bigger government.Bernie the economic illiterateBoy joe..whiff much?@joerogan Great Convo! Bring the others in. Cheers, DGBernie is so consistent. You know that when he says something, he means it. Great conversation and I look forward to President Bernie Sanders!Pipe-dreams &amp; utopian visionsJoe switched to classroom formal English.... interesting.....Bernie/Tulsi2020<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m26s">1:04:26</a>  memes will be made   &quot;Bernie wants to blow up the Earth&quot;He could play a mobster whit that voiceShould&#39;ve asked him why he banned Kaitlin Bennett from his town hall. Nasty move.Notice how every time he talks about someone he spoke with, its a woman. Each time. Almost like hes taking notes from Cilntons subliminal handbook.NO WAY!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS? BERNIE TRYNA GET THE YANG FOLLOWERS LMAO YANG FOR LIFE BABYYYYYJoe was pretty easy on Bernie I’d say&quot;That&#39;s what greed is all about!&quot;<br /><br />Not letting the government take money that YOU earned? I guess I&#39;m greedy...<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s legal because THEY MAKE THE LAWS!&quot;<br /><br />No, Senator Sanders, YOU as a legislator make the laws.BERNIE FOR PRESIDENT !Shout out to joe for trying to hide that lip herpes by hiding behing the mic and facial hair.Talks about politicians like he hasn’t been one for his entire career.I wish Joe confronted Bernie on his radical communist past.  And yes, it was radical, Comrade.I hate this. He says something that is 100% accurate and good and then slaps on other things that are flat out bad. Like that 0-4 year old children are in a very delicate state that need a parent around then jumping to $15 minimum wage. If what’s happening right now in NY isn’t teaching people that a high minimum wage is a bad idea, I don’t know what will.He came across very genuine. Thanks for doing these Joe we need them.Bernie was against nafta and the tpp he truly wants prosperity for all Americans1st to commentEven if ppl get $15 before taxes..ppl still can&#39;t afford housingNot enough thumbs down for this idiot. No care about facts, costs, ramifications or anything at all (such as the unemployment which is always created by minimum wage laws. Bankrupting businesses, collecting less tax, and increasing welfare payments for that unemployment). <br /><br />Its worse than an empty promise. Its like a jack in the box except its a fist and now you have a bloody nose. Better an empty promise cause no harm is done. <br /><br />Look at the price per person it costs in the UK £2200, Luxembourg $6812, Switzerland $6468 etc etc with the cheapest in the western world being Spain at $2965 (but ive heard it was €3500 so i think wikipedia got that wrong). <br /><br />Compare that to what you can get for insurance covering a family of 4 of £600 (im in the UK). The private industry does it for a fraction of the government does. Government gets into bed with drug companies cause for politicians and bureaucrats its better for their portfolios. Its guaranted income and great money for them. Thats why the corporations write the laws. <br /><br />You need separation of business and the state like you need separation of church and state. Ive been through the NHS my entire life, and ive even been through the Spanish healthcare system. Wait times of 6 months to a year or more are real. However with just a fraction of the money government spends the private industry gets you appointments that week.<br /><br />Its also government that has made healthcare in the US so expensive. Theyve limited hospitals, teaching schools etc etc. Everything they can to keep those prices high. Hospitals that want to be tax free have to have a certain percentage of people who cant paid per month. Well thats why they will sometimes charge insane prices for stiches, x-rays etc. They need people who cant afford their service! Its perversed incentives.In b4 the democrats call bernie alt right at the next debate just for being on the podcast.OH BOISBernie for president 2020&quot;Is healthcare being a human right a radical notion?&quot; Making the services of other human beings a right is extremely radical, basically slavery. The founders and philosophers saw rights as the things natural to humans and animals, like the right to live, self defense, speech etc. Rights deal with what you can&#39;t do to others, not what you have to do.Bernie is horribleGreat interview! Don’t agree with Bernie’s stance on firearm bans, but I definitely enjoyed listening to what he had to say. Thank you Joe for getting him on :)Where is Bernie&#39;s neck!?I find it interesting that your past two guests love socialism. This is also kind of unethical (giving his campaign a huge platform for free). I mean, it&#39;s your show, that&#39;s freedom, but it&#39;s also shilling, and it says a lot, especially when you understand what a manipulative partisan and divisive politician he is, you&#39;re waxing his image here and allowing him to portray himself however he wants. Sure, this is your right, but was it right? You can&#39;t trust someone like this, and during an election their phoniness is total. I&#39;m sure most will see this is good and civil but it&#39;s a joke, like this man.Ahhhhhhhhhhhhbsolutely.       Yeah they don’t get enough time period and sometimes a lot of just a little can take more then a few minutes and a couple days in real brain time to explain to a dummy for the ones that are.love joe, hate this guy. trump 2020. ive heard enough from him.No medications come out of Canadian socialized healthcare system, Hep C is now curable, Cancer survival rates have sky-rocketed, Aids prevention drugs exist, and yes they have made some substantial profit. Tech companies have made trillions in the last 20 years and have done what exactly, they sold your privacy and are now censoring you. Don&#39;t get me wrong heart surgery/cancer treatment should not end up costing people tens of thousands of dollars.This maniac sold is to trump through crooked Hillary. Lock her up! Lock her up!Props to Bernie Sanders for having the balls to get on the podcastYo put Bernie in the house im trying to get my student debt canceledThis dude rambled for an hour about nothing no solutions nothingSearch &quot;top 10 respected climate change skeptics&quot; and you will find Nobel prize winners and top scientists around the world saying it is more politically correct sentiment driving it than true factWarren Sanders 2020! We need a change in this country, a real change and if it doesnt work we can go back but we need candidates who care about the those making less than 7 figures. Forgiving student loan debt would be a game changer. All of a sudden people who are struggling low middle class will skyrocket up and the economy would boomBernie didn&#39;t really tell us who he was backing for 2020.Where are these gun shows they speak of that do not require background checks? Here in Texas any gunshow I’ve been too I had to fill out a form 4473 as required by the federal gov.Every candidate has something i like and dont like on both sides so i dont view myself as republican or Democrat. The people that say they like everything their candidate wants to do are lying to themselves and it doesnt help the country.Joe, fantastic job asking direct questions.America pls make this man president!Good job getting him on Joe. New gained respect for Bernie after watching this. Doubt he&#39;ll get my vote lol, but he seems to mean well.If I was Jeff Bezos and I had this guy talking shit about me all the time, i would pay one of his own bodyguards 100 mil to make him disappear. If billionaires are so powerful Bernie, how are you still here?I was all in favor for Bernie till I listened to this. This guy is a solid unexciting rock. What leaders can he sway with this lack of charisma ?Bernie Sanders is terrible correct in his opinions and analysis about the the US&#39; problems.Cancel my auto loan and mortgage too.<br />Make everything free, you don&#39;t need ambition to be successful we&#39;ll all be equal.......yeah right.McDonald&#39;s combos cost, on average, the price an Employee gets paid to work there, per hour.<br />Who wants a $15 big mac meal?

Anything couldve been said. He chooses &quot;I dont think its that big of a burden for businesses&quot; He looked straight at the ground, couldnt even make Joe believe his opinionated reply.Also... What you are calling an assault weapon is nothing more than a scary looking semi-auto rifle. A nut job can do the same damage with a semi-auto hunting rifle that doesn&#39;t look scary but is just as deadly.😴😴😴😴😴😴Climate Change is a hoax to control and fine and tax people and businesses.

He says.... tax the rich. No tax hike on middle class. Buy the math simply doesnt add up. Canada pays nearly 50% income tax for thr middle class. Those who vote Bernie better be ready to hand over thier hard earned income to the Feds. Yikes!Okay Bernie has to win now, especially since he promised Joe that he will announce the existence of aliens if he becomes privy to the information.I LOVE AMERICAS GRANDPA ❤️😭Joe needs Rand Paul next!If you only watch some of this watch the last 15-20minsAny presidential candidate should get 3hrs with joe to be elected.

Imagine Bernie doing the ElonInteresting...Let me pause this at 2 seconds, and give it a great big thumbs down real quick....A lot of people dont understand that socialist aspects in our economy had to be used where capitalism failed.<br />Example is social security.Yes bruh tf thank you joe rogan.I’m still voting trump 😘I agree with everything he says except the tax on stocks being traded short term capital gains tax is 35-40% to pay for student loans, Medicare for all yes, me paying for a irresponsible person who took a loan at whatever age and had no plan to pay it off. I&#39;m 38 I&#39;d love to go back to school but I have to plan for retirement, it would be a shitty loan. Cap the loan amount s per degree make student loans like business loans have to have a written plan to get one.You guys remember 20 years ago when they told us we had 12 years to fix our planet? <br />Hahahaha<br /><br />And 30 years before that, we had 20 years. <br />Hahahaha <br /><br />tRuMp dOeSnT beLiEve iN sCieNcE jajajajajajaWhere is chiner and russer?Shameless Brown Nose(pinko) ROGAN.at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=38m19s">38:19</a>.....this guy picks his nose and puts it in his pocket without skipping a beat.

Wtf lolI was pretty open minded to listening to Bernie even though I don&#39;t agree with a lot of his policies but when he started talking about gun control he lost me. The idea if it&#39;s an active shooter versus a crowd of unarmed people that an AR15 with a 30 round mag is going to kill more people then a handgun with two 15 round mags is ridiculous.

Only an hour, wtf?! Kyle Kulinski was right, Bernie sort of shot himself in the foot by coming out as a democratic socialist instead of a social democrat (what his platform actually is). Oh well, great to see him on, go Bernie 2020! Now get Noam Chomsky on before he kicks the bucketPeople in the comments supporting this man need to get a reality check.<br /><br />He’s a criminal. Isn’t he still being investigated by the FBI?

And says Melania is a hottie!THIS MAN HAS BEEN CONSISTENT FOR 40 YEARS !! HIS VOTING RECORD IS IMMACULATE ! <br /><br />Looking into the voting record of a politician is the BEST way to see if they are talking crap or not ..... Bernie means what he says , he has been saying this for 40 years , all through the long night of the Corporation and Greed. <br /><br />So many of us got hood winked by Obama, and he was able to do it because he came out of nowhere , Bernie has been around for a very very very long time and like I said his record shows he isnt a con artist .<br />Rebublican people , please dont hate on this guy , he does mean well !<br /> I live in Australia and we look at the health debate in the USA with a WTF ?! type attitude , and so does everyone  else in the western world .This guy wants to take 80% of your money and give it to people who will spend it on drugs. He’s a piece of trash and should not be in this light. I can’t believe people take this TuckFard seriously. Trump has done more for this country in 3 years than Bernie has in 50 years of “public service”, he has 4 houses... why does a socialist need 4 houses?You Can&#39;t Vote for Bernie in the Primary if you&#39;re NOT Registered Democrat!!! Democrats have &quot;Closed Elections&quot; meaning if you&#39;re registered &quot;Independent&quot; for example, you can&#39;t vote in the Primary.

All issues discussed are so complicated I wish they could have gone a bit deeper.<br />I’m a center right republican who believes logical discussions need to take place.  No one should be so closed minded that they can’t take a good hard look at our country and admit we are a nation in crisis.  <br />We don’t have to agree with everything being said but maybe if we listen we can be part of a solution.I wonder if Joe smoked him out afterwardsI love it when they recognize the fact that those &quot;debates&quot; are a reality TV show.<br />Because take it from a guy who was born and raised in europe, and now lives in australia.<br />The rest of the world absolutely sees your politics as reality TV.As a Moderate Republican, I can say this may or may not have me in Bernie&#39;s camp moving forward.24 min of my life ill never get back thanks joe.Fuck Communism!

They share high prices to fund this research. Price controls would affect this. I’m pretty sure his default would be, “let the government fund research” but we’re broke. And besides government cherrypicks what research to fund. Get rid of most of the FDA regulations and drug prices will go down. A lot of the expenditures from drug companies is spent trying to meet some crazy standards and for lobbying. If the companies know they won’t be heavily regulated, they’ll spend less on lobbying too. This is just my opinion though, I’m open to being wrong.“There are four ways in which you can spend money.  You can spend your own money on yourself.  When you do that, why then you really watch out what you’re doing, and you try to get the most for your money.  Then you can spend your own money on somebody else.  For example, I buy a birthday present for someone.  Well, then I’m not so careful about the content of the present, but I’m very careful about the cost.  Then, I can spend somebody else’s money on myself.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on myself, then I’m sure going to have a good lunch!  Finally, I can spend somebody else’s money on somebody else.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on somebody else, I’m not concerned about how much it is, and I’m not concerned about what I get.  And that’s government.  And that’s close to 40% of our national income.”<br />-Milton FriedmanTrump need a Joe rogan interviewWho else saw 1 hour long and was dissapointed ?I&#39;d like to see Trump on the podcast. That would be very interesting.I encourage you all to actually fact check what he is saying, most of his anecdotal evidence is wrong or skewed. His health care sounds nice with that but when you but in real facts from unbias Canadians and Americans you will see the American Health Care System is better. Although somethings should be change for optimization we are still in a good state. He is an old man and has been doing this for a long time so very obviously he is good at be persuasive to people who dont fact check. :) Have a nice dayHello Twitter World, vote Joe Rogan for PRESIDENT !Hes argument is that if he passes legitimization to provide medication to all citizens by the government the pharmaceutical companies will make less money?! Is he retarded? That kind of legislation will ensure endless spending on exactly that.When I hear &quot;healthcare as a human right&quot; I&#39;m kinda too distracted by what an absurd nonsense idea that is to listen to the specifics of the implementation (which I might agree with). Disappointed in Joe for not saying &quot;yes that does sound radical&quot;. You can&#39;t have a right to someone else&#39;s labor. That&#39;s not what rights are. This is how you know Bernie isn&#39;t operating on principles, just whatever sounds good to the average idiot.Eddie should have been there...Joe Gate Keeper Rogan, ol middle of the road JoeWho expects Joe to really hold this 🤡 to the fire on some of his B.S ? GO ON LARS LARSON ASSHATThe guy didnt offer 1 solution... He wants to treat symptoms not causes. Is rogan always this soft with his guests? I expected fireworks, this was a snooze.Joe I hope you understand how truly world-changing this is medium is.<br />All I&#39;ve heard about this person from media is that he is trying to start a socialist movement and ruin healthcare.<br />Now I know that although his ideas on health care a liittle extreme he is truly thinking about what will actually make this world better with evidence-backed ideas.GO BERNIE GO!!!!I&#39;ll only be 17 by the time of the election, but god I wish I could vote for this man!If joe did to Bernie as he did to Alex jones and dig just a little deep in what he says and not take it for face value, he would see that bernie is full of twists and half truths, he literally just believed everything he said JUST because he said it lmaoIt&#39;s awesome seeing a great interview with a presidential candidate! Bernie did a great job interviewing Joe :)Good interview but what about immigration?All these damn corporation are gonna fuck Cannabis eventually :/Disappointed to know your a lib.Bernie Sanders-“99.9% of gun owners would never in a million billion years would think about killing other people BUT EVERYONE needs to sacrifice something to change what’s going on.”  No. The .1% of psychos need to be helped medically.When people make bad decisions they have to live and deal with them. It&#39;s not the governments place to fix everyone&#39;s problem.TRUMP 2020When Bernie honestly can demonstrate that he is aware of the net positive use of firearms that happens far more often than the net negative, maybe i will value his opinion.<br />Mass shooting? - Covered by every major news outlet.<br />12 year old kid saves his sisters from a home invasion with an AR? - Fuck him, he doesn&#39;t count.<br /><br />Left is wholly knee-jerk emotive in response while not being objective whatsoever.<br />Bernie is no exception.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, grandpa; An &quot;assault weapon&quot; is not a weapon patterned after military firearms.<br />It is a fucking weapon with a select-fire featuring either a burst or automatic mode, or both.Young Jamie had his limits testedThis guy talks too much.   I prefer the orange haired fuckwit.Imagine Ben Shapiro in the room with them. Thats the podcast we need.Bernie had an amazing way of dancing around and not answering the questions lolWHY ISN&#39;T # 45 IN JAIL AS AN ACCOMPLICE TO MASS MURDERI respect this conversation, but pertaining to healthcare, the comparison to Canada becomes elevated. Although, I don&#39;t see how this is comparable, in the US, we are run on supply and demand, with a population of over 330 million, there is a vast demand, yet Canada at only almost 40 million. Can someone please explain the point Sanders was trying to make about the price of insulin. Wouldn&#39;t it be that because there is less demand, things would be cheaper, and if so, what is the point in the comparison, it&#39;s made me think. Comment anything further if you&#39;d like, I&#39;d enjoy some other input.&#39;What is I mean?&#39;<br /><br /><br />only 1 hour of air time, something is wrong here.Bernie is a commie!Blue eyes Jew. Who hates Europeans. Period.  A rich hypocrite.Bernie has my vote.Joe “hey Bernie, have you ever used a reverse hyper” rogan.What a great interviewer joe has become. He pressed Bernie when he needed to be, but he wasn&#39;t aggressive about it and kept the conversation flowing.Anyone else notice how Bernie Sanders doesnt really provide any real solutions? He just complains about the rich or corporations. <br /><br />Wanna solve the pharmaceutical problem? Cut regulation so drug competitors can provide an equally effective drug at a cheaper cost. In the free market competition does more to regulate prices, rather than more legislation<br /><br />Bring Ben Shapiro on again. He actually gives solutions rather than point out problems and blame everyoneWhen u c both CNN &amp; Fox News can’t stop demonizing Bernie, u should question urself if he the one who is saying the right things..Here is my input as a Canadian. I really don&#39;t want to get political either because that just gets people heated and distracts from the point. I will just say I am all for gun rights but I am also for some changes to be made to the system. <br />I get the kind of frustration you hear from gun owners because I believe the vast majority of them are responsible gun owners and it is unfortunate to have to &quot;penalize&quot; the 99.9% of good people to restrict the 0.1% of bad people. <br />But at the same time I get the frustration from non-gun owners that some changes should be made to at least try to diminish the number of these atrocious acts. <br />By the way I&#39;m not saying that gun owners aren&#39;t concerned with these mass murders, not at all, I&#39;m just trying to point out the two main perspectives you hear right now. <br />Like I said, I&#39;m Canadian so what I am suggesting is purely based on the way our system works. Is it perfect? Of course not, but I think some of our laws prevent these situations (only to a certain extent of course) or at the very least, discourage them.<br />The way our gun system works:<br />We all the capability to own all the same guns that are in the United States.<br />But in our system, gun ownership isn&#39;t necessarily a right but more a privilege that has to be earned.<br />It&#39;s actually really simple. The only real step is to apply for a gun permit. We have two permits, your standard hunting permit and your handgun permit.<br />You need to first complete a course for each, or you can have them combined in a 3 day course.<br />At that point your request for gun ownership is sent to the government where they run a background check for criminal records, mental health and psychiatric records and also look at things such a any addiction issues (although I think this last one is not necessarily a deciding factor) and then if everything passes you usually get your permit within 2-3 months.<br />And at that point you are free to purchase any firearm(s) or ammunition(s) of your choice.<br />We also do have certain laws on how you must transport weapons, usually in a gun box, but that is not as important of a factor in my mind and wouldn&#39;t work in the US since you have carry laws anyway.<br />I also recognize there is the biggest difference in both our systems which is obviously that guns cannot be used for self defense in Canada. I realise that&#39;s kind of controversial but that is besides the point, that is just the way the system is set up in Canada. <br />So the main thing I was focusing on is that by having to complete a simple course before being able to apply for your permit, I think that could at least cut down more or less on any impulsive acts of violence where people are feeling vengeful on a certain day or something. And to the people that are really set on committing a violent act, well I guess it won&#39;t do that much to stop them but it is one more step and 3 month waiting period ahead of them where hopefully they can achieve some clarity and have a change of mind.<br />And maybe the other important thing of course would be for all parents that own weapons to have them somewhere where only they have access.<br />I know this was a very long post but that would be my thoughts on a possible solution (at least right now) that could potentially cut down on these situations and also something that accommodates more or less both sides of the isle.<br />I hope I won&#39;t get any hate for this post I mean these are only my thoughts. I realise a change in law like this would be a rather big change and might get a lot of push back but it doesn&#39;t stop anybody that is fit to own guns for self defense but at least puts a kink in the wheels of any lunatics thinking to do something bad.They are implementing secure entry and do mass shooting drills at my kid&#39;s grade school. This is a sick country.Imagine my shock... Joe goes full wimp loser on Bernie. Sad Joe, just sad.  <br /><br />Oh wait... back Alex Jones into a corner and make him explain himself!!!I love brotha Bernie 🙏Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care. 💙🐦👓Regardless of your political views...as a HUMAN...if you have any sense at all, it is so obvious to see that Bernie actually cares and wants to help. You may not agree with all of his positions but he is genuine.Ya know I wasn&#39;t for Bernie since he bowed to Hillary in 2016 I wish Joe had asked why he cucked when he was such a vicious voice for the blue collared worker which I am. After this podcast I have a glimmer of hope, however I am sure Yang, Tulsi, nor Bernie will win. I believe civil war 2 corporation boogaloo is right around the corner. Love ya Joe I hope you surviveBernie talks like he’s gonna fight the powers that be. Drug companies, oil industries, bankers. Lol give me a break. He ain’t gonna do a damn thing. He’ll be “suicided” by the morningBernie is a communist who will destroy this country but I do appreciate the fact the you let him speak.  Now do the President (I didn&#39;t vote for him).  Do the rest of the Dems too.  Great job Joe!if you won&#39;t be prez in the USA - come to Germany!!! Plenty of work to do here...and Merkel has some severe health problems at the moment...Good thing Joe didn’t press Bernie on any topics. He would’ve been exposed for not knowing anything besides sound bites.We need to be promoting our youth finding happiness.  So that John Doe, doesn&#39;t grow up to be miserable at his job hate his boss and blow him to bits out of depression and being over worked.<br />That&#39;s what we NEED.<br /><br />We also REALLY need to acknowledge College isn&#39;t for everyone.all the dislikes from butt hurt red hatters ... Let&#39;s be real, Joe brings 2 on at a time to debate along with the racist orange motherfucker, and we will ALL see their true colors.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=51m23s">51:23</a>   There was an experiment done with rats and heroin.<br />One group was rats individually isolated, with nothing except food and heroin, which they could self-administer.  They kept dosing themselves until they died.<br />Another group was effectively in rat paradise:  Social environment, other rats to mate with, stuff to play with, etc.<br />They tried the heroin, but rarely bothered with it again.  Better things to do!<br />Opiates are a drug of escape; whether it&#39;s pain, despair, or whatever.Nothing says im in touch with the kids like a 1 hr jre interview.I dont even support Bernie, but it was pretty interesting getting a un interrupted look at his point of viewThe only country on earth that doesmt provide free health care . What about iraq and iran&#39;s Healthcare ? Talk about that counties healthcare and id be interestedIf the drug companies are spending 4B in lobbying. I would like to know who is taking this money. Or where it went to. Drop names!LOL Ross Perot....I voted for that guy :)I think I will be voting for Bernie Sanders!Pushing socialist agenda for over 35 years.  Whoever supports Bernie must be mentally retarded.  I went through this in Eastern Europe and this shit doesn&#39;t work.So Joe&#39;s had at least 3 dems, 1 independent on here, (Yang, Tulsi, Sanders, Johnson) why no Republican yet? No Ron Paul the Great, not even Don Jr. who apparently wants to be on. So what gives, Joe? <br /><br />Point of Personal Privilege! Point Of Personal Privilege! Trump 2020!So this went nowhere...... Bernie lost me when he started with the whole &quot;Trump is a racist&quot; nonsense. Stick to your platform, Bernie.i have friends in canda. they tell me..good luck on seeing a doctor when you need too. they are booked months out and its next to impossible to get an appoitment with the good ones so you settle for a second tier doctor..good luck with that. i understand what bernie is trying to do but give me one example of where his free healthcare REALLY works and ill consider it. until then we have it better than any other contry&quot;Joe just had Bernie on to grift him into being a knotsy&quot; - some idiot probablyYou lost me at climate changeThis podcast is amazing it&#39;s great how many people he has on it I swear everybody likes Joe Rogan&quot;Other countries&quot; and &quot;Free stuff&quot;, Sanders 2020.I hope this was able to be a bit informative to those who only regularly watch joes right wing content, Bernie’s ideas aren’t nearly as scary as the pundits make them out to be and he’s the only true grass roots anti establishment candidate left!Though I think it’s unrealistic we can fund his proposals, he is indeed speaking the truth about influence. <br />BTW, Cal State tuition, up to the ‘80s, was very low. But, they stung you with fees, similar to state school tuition and fee prices across the US.Bernie&#39;s spewing fake news about not having to do a background check when purchasing a firearm from an authorized dealer from the Gun Show&#39;s. You absolutely have to do a background check just like if you were purchasing one from a store.Bernie Sanders 4 prez, Tulsa 4 vice, Warren 4 treasurerIf UFO&#39;s weren&#39;t asked about this wouldn&#39;t have been a Joe Rogan podcast.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=29m24s">29:24</a> &quot;If we can bail out wall st, you know what?

YES!!!Bernie used to be okay in 2015 but after he lost he just sold out. He&#39;s a shadow of what he was in 2015🙂Such a good interview. Thanks. I hope you see more candidates get time on the show too, out of balanced democracy. I also would like to see more from Bernie later, pressing deeper in some areas.If you touch assault weapons, you have civil war. It is that extreme of a statement. If you want it you get itBernie: How much did university of California cost 50 yrs ago?<br /><br />Joe: I don’t know. How much? <br /><br />Bernie: virtually free.....<br /><br />Joe: how much? <br /><br />Bernie: I don’t know. But close to free. <br /><br />WOW.They definitely restarted this podcast and edited the beginning out... The opening sounds a little too rehearsedBern said Putin isnt crazy ?  Da Fuq ?Love this!

He got kicked out of a hippy socialist commune, and get this &quot;for being too fucking lazy&quot;America needs BernieWhat&#39;s really crazy is American taxpayers pay most of the costs for research &amp; development of pharmaceuticals, pay for the patent and then get to pay an exorbitant price for them. Yay, aren&#39;t we exceptional!I wouldn’t vote for Bernie in a million years. But I am GLUED to this interview. Love itThis was a very informative interview. Bernie did a really good job explaining his views and I appreciate that.Who&#39;s going to tell the middle East to stop producing oil,you Bernie?This man&#39;s a complete hypocrite and moroni have a question if anyone knows the answer, who would all the assault rifles go to if there were to be a ban? I&#39;m having trouble thinking of an answer that doesn&#39;t make me uncomfortable. I&#39;m sure that it&#39;d be better to let &quot;whoever&quot; have the guns than giving one to some random asshole who&#39;s gonna shoot into a crowd of dozens of people all at once. I still would like to have an idea though. thxI want to like the guy, he seems like he really cares... but his understanding of economics is just trash. I generally vote Libertarian (Ron Paul 2012) but out of the current lot of democrats, I prefer Tulsi Gabbard.<br /><br />Audio books on economics : Henry Hazlitt Economics In One Lesson, Murray Rothbard What has Government Done to our Money and Ron Paul End the Fed.Joe Rogan yet again playing softball on:<br />Minimum wage<br />Gun control<br />Healthcare.<br />Student loan debt. <br /><br /><br /><br />Even after Ben Shapiro has clearly explained time and time again why leftists are so wrong on all of these issues. <br />.....Complete silence from Joe.Bernie Sanders isn&#39;t far left to the rest of the developed world, let that sink in...I don&#39;t support a communist like bernie sanders, but I will listen to see what wack-ass ideas he has to propose.Fuck Bernie... Get trump on the podcast!Why do idiots like Bernie Sanders and other far left socialist democrats keep talking about Republican talking points when in fact they are political viewpoints of other people and legitimate thinking of politics. Bernie Sanders is a hack for International socialism is a representation of a dangers of it and how it threatens our democracy Joe. Why do you have this old fool on your showKnow what bernie got my vote 🗳Is Burnie going to sell all his big ass houses? NO verry simple... Just your money... Just another criminal....Bernie is out of his mind.  Wasting time n money. Trump has this election in the bag just like the last one except now more like trump cause he gives results and makes all our lives better. You would have to be insane to deny these facts.And the reason HE don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much for employers to pay that much is because he doesn&#39;t employ people full time.... Ask him what he pays his staffers for the people  working on his campaign Joe.... He lost his shit last month when they demanded $15 an hour ... Actually he said he would have to cut hours. So again what good is double the pay for half the hours ?The people only love Bernie because they think he’s going to give them what he says he’ll give them. Mr. BS with empty platitudes and an empty head to match.🇨🇦do it Joe get TRUMP on i Double Dog Dare You🇨🇦 ill buy you Med Double DoubleCan&#39;t believe how well this video turned out. Very very nice job!That&#39;s where it starts Joe. Taylor wanted to disarm his citizens what would happen there. It starts with assault rifles where does it end. Just Bernie even know what an assault rifle is lolI think we should come up with a new term, since capitalism in it&#39;s own is the only way, the thing is, some take it to the extreme.<br />I think the real enemy of this world are the &#39;&#39;Extreme Capitalists&#39;&#39;, they need to be slowed down, or nothing will be left.Senator Sanders: &quot;Gun&quot; violence is just violence. Mental Health background checks? OK... maybe. But... The roots of this sort of violence grow out of a serious dysfunction of all of the traditional (60&#39;s &amp; 70&#39;s) liberal concerns ie. POVERTY, ECONOMIC TYRANNY, EDUCATION, SOCIAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS, HEALTH &amp; MENTAL HEALTH, RACISM, CLASS DISPARITY, etc. <br /><br />Stay true to these values, create a better adjusted society and &quot;gun&quot; violence will diminish... probably by a lot.<br />Just institute draconian ineffective &quot;gun control&quot; and we will just end up like Great Britain ie. Strict gun control... still has a rental truck, knife, bomb violence problem. <br /><br />Plus, lets all just call the 2nd and 14th Amendments settled law (which they are) and move on to more pressing matters.<br />Wishing you and yours the very best in life,<br />DocGet Slavoj Zizek on JoeThis is why people like Bernie. You can agree or disagree with his policies, but at least he fights for something. Does anyone think that Biden or Harris will fight for something??...well other than who blows Wall Street better.Joe, Amazon does pay taxes, this lie has been debunked numerous times.  Amazon pays payroll taxes, property taxes, and a whole host of other taxes.Been saying this for years every American should be on the streets protesting against lobbyism it is bribery plain and simple. It destroys the very fabric of democracy and instead everything is shaped and run by the rich to suit their needs and not yours that is why you are struggling, America has turned into a debt ridden society plagued by vultures. Opioids have killed more people that the Vietnam war, yet have the been banned? Nope and so the pandemic continues. When the AIDS pandemic hit in the 80’s they didn’t give a shit about the countless babies and people dying until they did the blanket protests in Washington DC  right outside their doorstop it wasn’t until then that Reagan realized that problem wasn’t going away and he could no longer turn a blind eye. The only difference between these people and the gangsters on the streets is that they were suits.I agree with him on the insurance companies.  That being said national healthcare would cost $35 trillion.   Our national GDP is $20T.  It&#39;s called math.Listening to a politician radically changes my opinion of them they aren&#39;t just a talking head betting there career on 45 seconds of speaking time.As an Australian, I feel like the main obstacle for people not voting Bernie and his Medicare is that Americans simply haven&#39;t experienced the fantastic feeling of going to the doctors to fix your health and being told that it&#39;s free. Americans, you love your country, but your country doesn&#39;t seem to love you back.The bernie bros invaded this comment sectionHave him on with Peter SchiffAfter watching this podcast, it is super apparent that Bernie doesn&#39;t understand a whole facet of economics; which is the entrepreneurial side. America won&#39;t benefit from earning money, if there isn&#39;t anywhere to work or spend your money. All because the government has put impossible legislation on fledgling owners. Not good policy for the majority of America, after the chain of events conspire. He is unpologetically ignorant about small business, of which most of America&#39;s wealth comes from.Wow, about damn time you had a decent guest on your show, JoeHoly shit. Was my reaction to the title. Let&#39;s have a listen.Joe&#39;s comprisedGood to see Bernie talking like a normal person and not yelling. LolAs a member of the rest of the world and America so hungry to run, police and profit from us can I just throw my vote at Berinie with yang as his vice. Real people actually give a fuk about real people.The problem with health care for all here in the usa is that you pay $100 for an aspirin at the hospital or $100,000ish for a mre scan. Make the costs more reasonable and the overall cost of health care for all goes down. I mean when a drug prescription goes from $100 to fill to over a thousand because some scumbag bought the company and increased prices.I can&#39;t believe joe smoked weed with Bernie!!??I like how Joe told him that the good gun owners are the ones that feel let down by a ban. I have several &quot;assault&quot; rifles and I&#39;d never consider doing something crazy.Joe rogan. Your the smartest “regular guy” I’ve viewed on YouTube.  You ask good questions. Your podcasts hit on some good questions and your viewpoints on marijuana saying how they make people more aware of each other’s interactions with each other is spot on.  Joe, Bernie is crazy..  hahaFuck your ads joe.&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous, I would never have the Turtle King on my podcast, Bernard.&quot;&quot;SHE&#39;S A DOCTA&quot;Finally a good episodeI would love to see Bernie Sanders as president with Andrew Yang as Vice President.Can we go with personal responsibility at some point?This should have more views and subs than Jannelle Eliana...what&#39;s going on here?!?! Maybe you can get her on, Joe! :PDont forget to hit that Dislike button folks!I LIKE making money. FUCK YOU.But a practicalilty he&#39;s not talking about is that you go to college, get in debt and can&#39;t get a job cause that job requires prior experience.<br />He&#39;s going over the basics, like that&#39;s nice but it&#39;s nothing we haven&#39;t heard before.Candidates need to debate in podcast format.I think Bernie does an exceptional job at identifying and explaining the governments systemic issues but feel he missed his mark on elaborating on any plan he has to rectify these things. A long form podcast is the perfect place to get those plans out no less, Joe’s who has millions of viewersalso , ( what is an asalt weapon )Lol so many dislikes on this video. The salt is real.I love bernie after this if they take him out we gonna riot!!!! Forsure!!!!Now he&#39;s calling survival tools weapons of mass destruction what a complete f*<b>***</b> idiotI wish Bernie would support legalizing all drugs, or at the very least decriminalize them. Other than that he’s awesomeGuns aren&#39;t allowed to us for hunting joe. They&#39;re allowed to us to keep our government in check. Really enjoyed the slow ball questions to btw, waaaay to challenge the guy.The man is an Idiot The Us can go carbon neutral and it wont change a thing...think China IndiaNot shocked Joe didnt Challenge bernie at allThe anger in the replies warm my democratic socialist heart. Bernie the legend! 💪There are only 2 ways of distributing a scarce resource;<br />Rationing or Price<br />What about incentive?Mental health is a scapegoat. It&#39;s white supremacy&quot;How are you gonna pay for it&quot; <br />&quot;By understanding we have massive wealth inequality&quot;<br />WhatI&#39;ve heard all I need to know of this man in his own words. Piss off Bernie!! Move to Moscow,   after all , you said how much you loved it. Never held a real job for the last 30 years, your life?How is this only one hour? It should be 2.30 or 3 hours easy.Not fond of his flirting with id politics, nor his stance on guns, but I want some healthcare dangitFree everything!!! Yall are fucking suckers, every last one of you who believe this cunt or any politician. Bahhh baahh sheep. Tell me what extraordinary measures and bills did he help pass in Vermont ? Nothing, jack shit. Isnt it interesting that all the media and politicians are ranting and raving about the two mass shootings but not one fuxking word about the violence in the inner cities where in one weekend countrywide it surpasses substantially the murder and victims of these two shootings. Oh and 84% of all homicides are done with a handgun. Facts suck. Drink the cool aid.Socialist Jew tries to manipulate once again. Thanks, Toe Rogan.Dan Crenshaw next!Andrew Yang as President and Bernie as Vice!Talks about green initiatives while flying around in a private jet .... talks about living wage while paying his campaign employees well less than $15/hour. He’s a hypocrite like all evil socialists... beware of this phony he’s coming for your freedom and liberties.Joe Rogan has become one of my favorite people. He doesn&#39;t have to do this. Let&#39;s appreciate this stuff man.People from Canada must often seek Medical Procedures In the US where Innovation is Happening. 🙄 I have friends in the UK who wait weeks &amp; months for medical care - but it’s free.

You wanna win 2020, you better sit down with the guy from the Fear Factor!!!emergency room for over 30 minutes cost me over 5000 dollars, what a total rip off from the hospital!People need to stop using Canada as an example of healthcare done right.  Canadian doctors get you in and out as fast as possible.  They are not knowledgeable, and they are essentially glorified salesmen for the pharmaceutical industry.  The good news is that there is assistance in Canada.  The bad news is you need it badly.  I know people from other places in Europe including Britain, who could run a business there, but the moment they tried in Canada there were too many hoops to jump through, and they couldn&#39;t make it financially viable.  The result is jobs are hard to come by.  People here act like they won the lottery when they get a job. There are only a handful of communities in Canada where the minimum wage, which is better than most, is enough to afford anywhere to live, and those are the places that have no jobs.  There are severe housing shortages, and since immigration has exploded thanks to changes made a decade ago, the population in most areas has exploded, and affordable housing has not kept up.OH MY FUCKING GOD. Its Bernard on Joe RoganNot a Bernie fan but frankly I gain mad respect for anybody who will sit down with Joe. Most of these polished turd politicians wouldn&#39;t dare subject themselves to an environment where they may potentially have to answer some tough questionsI&#39;m not validating recent shootings but maybe increased stress on a growing class that has been saddled with debt along with lack of mental health awareness and basically disenfranchising an entire generation along with an internet culture where people don&#39;t deal with reality  day to day while politicians push political and business agendas coupled with racist rhetoric  might make someone disgruntledHe&#39;s the most honest lying politician in WashingtonCame here and went straight to the comments lolTrump is a fascist. Literally Hitler.<br />Trump is a white supremacist.<br />The government is running concentration camps on the border.<br />Also Dems. We want you to turn in your guns.It&#39;s crazy to think that as I set here listening to one of our 2020 presidential candidates discuss the issue of student loans, I&#39;m making my first student loan payment of $10,000.<br /><br />Edit: You can still go to college at a reasonable rate, if your smart about it. I will pay my loans off in 3 years, under a moderately agressive repayment schedule far above minimum payments.<br />If someone is getting their social security garnished, it&#39;s probably their own fault due to poor decision making compounded across their life. Their is still a medicine to this epidemic and it&#39;s called hard work, and dedication.hey bernie remember when the DNC fucked you in the ass?Hahahahh last question.   Would you let us know? 😂LET&#39;S BE REALISTIC! Only 8% of the US population does not have access to healthcare. 8%. Now with a population the size of the USA that is a large number of people, however, my point is 92% have access to health care. There are shitty things like insurance companies dropping sick people, or people being UNDER INSURED (that is a bigger issue). however, for the majority of the people of the USA, they are covered in one from or another. The work shouldn&#39;t be to throw the baby out with the bath water, but focus on that 8%.THE FUTURE PRESIDENT IS FINNALLY HERE!!!Would have been nice for Joe to ask about Bernie’s campaign paying staff less than $15/hour.He didnt say anything of substance.  This may have lost him some voters, I dont care about any of the topics he mentioned.Of all people, Bernie should know that the term &#39;assault weapon&#39; is a made up term. There aren&#39;t assault knives or assault hammers. There are already background checks!! He is telling many fables tonight. Bernie will never win. Thank god.Good interview Joe!Good interview , I dont think Bernie is evil he seems like a very down to earth kind of guy.<br />I think view of Healthcare is attractive but I just can&#39;t put my faith in the Government to do an Efficient Job at Healthcare, let alone e the Government being the solution to most of our problems. Those impoverished cities they spoke about have been controlled  by one party for decades. <br />The Government is the whole reason for student debt by Federally backing  these loans , no bank in the WORLD would loan money to a teenager with no job but thanks to the Government they pass out money like candy.awesome too bad Joe not ask more about aliens and stuff like thatten minutes in he used wrong information to push a point.... I was a bernie bro before, I stopped being one once trump was elected. He wants to sound nice and innocent but he&#39;s a millionaire who wants to increase taxes drastically, and supports the new green deal... corrupt and hypocritical..Was this streamed live ? If not why not ?This was an eye opening podcast.imagine waking up at night and seeing Bernies nasty jew face staring down at you. thats some straight nightmare fuel. jesus christ hes ugly as my shit in the toiletBernie has been in washington dc for 23 years. In those 23 year why hasn&#39;t he been able to wrangle drug and healthcare prices under control? If he can&#39;t curb the profit making off health care, how does he expect to spend tax payer dollars on the inflated prices?!?Bernie Sanders is the most genuine candidate running for President of the United States. Go Bernie!!So passing a background check at a gun show is somehow different than at a gun shop no it’s not what he’s proposing is taking guns away from the good guys and punishing 4 plus million owners of this scary black gun come on put more effort into harsher sentences and finding who’s making and stealing these guns and using them in crimes or sold black market pretty rare someone is buying these guns to sell illegally for criminal use its a lot easier to make them thank the cartels and all the other scum bags for that being a gun owner growing up with the responsibility that come with owning guns this makes more sense than just take away the scary black guns from good people because you will never stop the black market gun making and distribution and infiltration into our country figure out how to stop that and make a differenceBernie is saying all our problems are legislated into existence by the government. At the same time he tries to make a case we need more government. Isn&#39;t there a logical flaw in his thinking? We just vote the right people (him) in and everything will fixed. The bad news is we have heard it generations.lower minimum wage for child workers, Joe? No. if you work, you get paid full wage. full stop.Shout out to Bernie Sanders <br />&amp;  Joe asking about aliens 👽I hope you offered Bernie some Elk?The only thing I don&#39;t agree with is that Bernie didn&#39;t include DMT in his health care plan.Ya, let&#39;s focus on the people who want to BUY government power (literally EVERYONE) and none of the people who want to SELL government power (the 535 people in Congress who put their names on the ballot).Sanders/Warren 2020 in a 42 state landslide.The negative implications are that he is wholly an un-American piece of shit! ‘All that he wants to do’ is for him and his mental state of health care denial. ‘Health Care’ is Insurance, which is a massive system made up of near equal systems of scale within that one larger entity. It cannot possibly be ran by government, the NHS is horribly understaffed and always overflowing with patients. I fell and hit my head and face hard on a loose gravel road when I was traveling in Surrey, it took me 4 hours (with a concussion and over 50 small but some deep lacerations that would stop bleeding on my face). The doctor literally took my blood pressure, shined a flashlight in each of my eyes and told me to come back if my head feels like it’s swelling. I went and paid £300 (about $560 at the time) to see a specialist, took an MRI, cleared me, and he gave me a piece of paper that permitted me to fly home and ended by saying I need to goto the hospital in San Diego asap, and that he nor the NHS have the equipment or time to deal with head injuries... and No, it was not because I wasn’t a UK citizen, I confirmed with a friend and UK citizen who had a head injury from a near death car accident and they literally could not do anything about his brain swelling, he slept in 1/2 hour naps for over a month fearful of not waking up because of it.Hell yeah!! Thank you joe!This fucking retard will get shot by the drug companies the minute he gets elected.I hold my political bias back until i hear their honest opinion not the facade on tv. Very humble and intelligent both tulsi gabbard and bernie sanders. Please have more of them on.Keep having candidates on Joe. It&#39;s really interesting to see the different points of view, even if I don&#39;t always agree with them.Bernie seeming real transparent, pointing out alot of the BS going on at the top and confirming alot of truths you hear about out here but can&#39;t confirm yourself.<br /><br />I can dig it, BernieGet Moscow Mitch on the show!!!!Everything Bernie just said about a buying a gun from a gun show is a complete lieYour mass shooting numbers are heavily skewedIt&#39;s all fun and games till your sitting in the oval office and you literally got nukes looking at you smh. More good people need to run for office in their states, preferably native Americans and Aboriginal people of this land and for this land.What a deadset fucking Fuck Wit.Bernie better know the 5 D&#39;s of dodge ballWe need presidential podcasts to be a thing<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Plz get trump on here, I wanna see what he&#39;s actually like in a conversationThey played an ad for lexapro while I was watching this. This is the problem!!!Would be nice to see Sanders facing off with a skeptical non-burner.Give tax breaks to everyone and get rid of SS, Medicare, Medicare, and cut the military spending by a ton.I kinda cringe when he said legislation for free air time for candidateI would pay good money to see Joe and Bernie smoke a fat joint togetherFun fact: Many Mexican drug cartels have meth labs and marijuana growing ops in national parks. Look it upJesus Bernie why are you so boring? Show some god damn enthusiasm.Thanks Joe! Now give us more candidates. I&#39;m more libertarian than anything but I still want to hear what everyone really has to say, not this garbage propaganda the media puts out.Bernie looks youngerHe&#39;s got my vote now that he did Joe&#39;s podcast. Lotta respect for BernieTulsi Gabbard is the Democratic parties&#39; best chance to win in 2020. In general I enjoy that Bernie shakes things up. I think Americans will scoff at this man in a general election. I think he might lose even worse than Clinton did in 2016 if he faces Trump, and I don&#39;t even like Trump.Bernie&#39;s ideal of a good time 8==} (_0_) right in the poop shootI would love a part 2 of this.JOE! Set up the conversations. More people will see them... unlimited time, unlimited rounds, no handlers, no TelePrompters.  Panel of  moderators to ensure ethical discussion and sound logic remain the foundation of the discussion! JRE is the best platform HANDS DOWN!EXCELENT freakin question JOE!just a reminder this is a guy who supported the soviet union and even had his honeymoon there.  (40 million dead under communism).  and also said venezuela is the future (people are eating dogs/cats/zoo animals).  babies regularly die in the hospital.  its a hell hole.  socialism is evil and this guy is insane and its insane anyone listens to this loon bag.Some of us have no problem<br />With the economic stuff, education, tax, etc that bernie talks about. But we don’t like social justice warrior snowflakes that are endlessly offended and hordes of illegals coming in. Socialism to Pay for hordes of illegals is not sustainable. These social programs should be for legal Americans only. Oh btw im latino.Can we get someone like Shapiro on with Bernie to ask some real questions-Downvotes = Cognitive Dissonance.So bernies response to the mass shootings is &quot;ban assault weapons&quot;. STupid...Great job Joe! Always asking questions I wish would be asked and more. During the discussion on decriminalization of drugs, I just want to add that Portugal had a huge success rate and (for the first time) I wish it was mentioned.Too many gun toters think they live in the best of all possible worldsYes, we&#39;re finally gonna find out if Bernie does DMTyou got Bernie on a billboard sayin &quot; BUY OUR MARIJUANER&quot;<br />you just might...im jus sayin...<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m30s">47:30</a>I thought Bernie was sounding pretty good compared to other Democratic parties but then you completely lose me on banning firearms. It&#39;s absurd to let the people who know nothing about firearms or the real statistics on shooting in America to put a narrative out that they should be banned.Internet is a powerful place.12 years my fuckin ass. I guess it gives us another reason to have another kickass y2k/Mayan calendar party.Im republican most of the time, but hes getting my vote. Hope the DNC doesnt screw him over again ...I can tell when an interview is going to be just a blabbering of themselves when an interview is this short. The man probably didn’t help him self at all. Now I watchWhat a joke.I have said this before and I say it again. Give every political candidate a free webpage on the internet. They can upload videos or podcast or whatever format they prefer to get their message out there. All these campaign contributions/etc tend to corrupt politics infinitely. We need to stop the ability of rich buying a candidate&#39;s ear. Corruption in all forms needs to be rooted out, not just in politics. Religion, sports, education, and other organizations have been corrupted. This stuff needs to be separated from money.Imagine if Joe regulated the debates instead of CNNI tried joe. I really tried. I cant do it. I&#39;ve listened to Kyle Kulinski, Abby Martin, etc but I cant listen this guy anymore. I made it 30 minutes but im tapping out.This is easily the most cancerous comment section I&#39;ve seen in years. I&#39;ll never understand how someone as level-headed, reasonable and sensible as Joe Rogan ended up being stuck with an audience so overwhelmingly full of ridiculous people who shouldn&#39;t even be capable of walking due to the weight of their egos.This guy showed his colors, when he told everyone to vote for Hillary Clinton.Omg, I&#39;m a bona fide Bernie fanboy here. So excited to see him on Rogan&#39;s platform!You think Beto will come on the show and do DMT live?Joe&#39;s interview game was great. Also regarding Bernie, hate him or love him but it&#39;s clear the man loves his country. Having said that, hey Bernie, don&#39;t come to Canada and take our fucking drugs. It fucks our system. Clean your own damn backyard.Tulsi, yang, Bernie. How about a republican joey badassThey should throw those DNC stooges they had for moderators out and have Rogan on there.If Joe decided to run he would have my vote! <br /><br />Joe Rogan 2020Bernie can not explain how he will pay for Medicare for all. Other than the middle class will pay thru the ass in taxes for it. Oh btw Canadian health care is not good. It takes months just to get in to see a doctor.   Ask a Canadian.How did this angry man from NY end up the congressman from Vermont? <br />Because the American Communist party based in NY put him there on purpose in order to change America into a socialist state.💥Joe rogan is a Democrat but he knows alot of his fan base are cry baby right wingers that will cry if joe Rogan speaks the truth about how he really feels about the stupid conspiracy theories that these dumb ass right wingers come up with. Lol joe rogan is smarter than that hes on the blue side✊.Too many stupid Americans. How can anyone still support Trump after what he has said and done for almost three years as president now. How can you stupid fucks vote against your own interests?<br /><br />BERNIE SANDERS 2020!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Wronghe makes almost no eye contact the entire podcast.Pretty far right libertarian, but honestly was good to see Bernie in longer form...hes not as crazy as I thought. Bad ideas but overall seems like he has good intentions.Thanks for having Bernie on, Joe!“Assault weapon”You cannot go to any doctor you want in Canada. You have to get a referral to a specialist. If you&#39;re really sick and you want to get a drug on compassionate use, you have to go to COURT. Americans subsidize the research and development of drugs for the rest of the world - someone has to pay for it! Canadians get cheaper drugs off of our backs because they don&#39;t pay their fair share.Bernie is such a badass. Good job Joe.Bernie on guns - wamp wamp.Bernie “I just talked to (random citizen) last night, and they said (anecdote supporting random thought)” SandersLove this! Keep the conversation going!who else isnt surprised that (((joe rogan))) has king commie Jew on his podcast?Bernie is a traitor who let Hillary and her corrupt team steal the presidential  run from him. She bent him over the table, pulled his pants doen and dildo&#39;d his old ass in front of everybody, and he took it with a smile.I like Bernie more now. HOWEVER, something I know for sure is that a $15.00 minimum wage would F<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CK">#CK</a> our economy up, and cause massive job loss... Supporting it is just ignorant... I&#39;m not sure about all his positions but how can someone who believes something that bad of an idea be trusted...Raising the minimum wage will destroy small and large business.... The company I work for for example would go out of business if the had to pay me double. I work 6 days a week 12 dollars an hour and I bring home rite at $600 a week. Do the math the $15 an hour minimum wage they speak of would be DOUBLE what I make now... I assure you my employer will not do double the business so how do I keep my job ? Tell me how $15 an hour for zero hours is better than $8 for 60.<br />Yeah pay a 15 year old kid $30 plus a year.... This guy&#39;s a fucking nuttGet Donald Trump on the show!!!Good ideas...but this guy will not create jobs...his ideas would make everyone a welfare recipientsthink Sanders gives politician type answers without saying anything, just sort of implying that what you want is what he will do. So for me, it is not just about policy, but honesty. In my view, Yang is the most ethical candidate we have had in a long time, and the one that can beat Donald Trump.Sorry Joe but I cannot stand this lying man. While I was watching this video I could feel his hand trying to grab my wallet. I had to keep pausing the video and make sure he wasn&#39;t getting itOnly an hour and seven minutes?<br /><br />Tulsi got a 2hr 30m episode and Yang got a 1hr 50m episode (not to mention Secular Talk got a 3hr episode). Don&#39;t mean to sound ungrateful (still a great episode) but I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m the least bit disappointed.<br /><br />EDIT: Listened all the way through, turns out he had other stuff, so it&#39;s all good.Bernie “ Buy our Marinara”  SandersHow about stop giving  Zionist-Israel 10.5 million a day and use that for medical and education 🤔Bernie2020👍👍👍I’m a fan. Big big fan. I haven’t heard any of the other candidates than Tulsi, but I liked majority of his answers and appreciate his passion and demeanor.i like a lot of bernie&#39;s intentions and thoughts, but i dont think him intelligent enough to pull the correct solution levers to fix this. It&#39;s great he&#39;s highlighting some of the problems but for example raising minimum wage is not the correct solution in the slightest if you do any sort of research. This kills small business.<br /><br />Yang has much better solutions thought out fit for the current day and age.  The country will not turn itself around until a lot of what he has in his platform is put into effect.I honestly thought his last question was gonna be “have you tried DMT?”Weird the only way to make a change is to stand up and do something about it wow.. I say that shit all the time. We have a nation that just want to sit around and complain on social media. We live in a democracy instead of hopping on ban wagons and being keyboard warriors we need to make a stand and actually do something about it.This climate change bullshit they push is fuckin BULLSHIT.....watch joes podcast with dan penaAll the cities joe named have been ran by democrats for decadesThat was an awesome podcast.Bernie ?!?!Thank you joe rogen for giving him at least an hour to break down his policies. Please if you can bring more canidates to your show so they can at least have an hr to break down thier policies instead of 45 secs. He was right. The debates felt like a reality show and as i watched it, i trully felt ashamed to be an american that evsn in politics, we resort to such behavior.Does he ask him if he conceded the primary in light of the super delegates rigging the process and backed clinton for that 5MM book deal? <br />Super rich do wonderful in socialistic countries. It is everyone else who suffers greatly. <br />Taxes and inflation keep people poor. Both functions of large government. Government is the problem not the solution. <br />Government involvement is the main driver for the insane cost of health care and education.you gota have trump on now joeI&#39;m a middle class business man....I can&#39;t afford health insurance and I don&#39;t qualify for welfare.....the people in the middle are &quot;up the creek!&quot;....It’s not utopian, it’s AmericanJust wanted 2 see if Bernie has tried DMTBernie, with all due respect. Climate Change is inevitable. This is nothing new. The earth has been through many changes and we are going through another one right now. How long before it effects humans dramatically? I think it&#39;s starting to now. However it&#39;s only just begun. Humanity better buckle up... this ride is about to get bumpy.Joe Rogan for President 2024!35 years ago Bernie Sanders was given a choice..Oh just fucking die already you communist fucking pig..your ideas always cost someone else moneySomething something DMTShow me a struggling daycare center and I’ll show you a man who was falsely accused. This primadonna has no idea how badly his marxist ideology is hurting people. Bernie, and every miserable, resentful, low-IQ nitwit like him are the problem.<br /><br />Bernie is campaigning on sweeping ideological generalities, and openly admits to having no plan whatsoever on implementation of his ideas. I stopped watching at 18 minutes in. I tried, but Bernie has nothing to say &amp; I have better things to do with my time.Joes a low key moderate Democrat for sure<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=16m07s">16:07</a> FDR once met with a group of activists who sought his support for bold legislation. He listened to their arguments for some time and then said, “You’ve convinced me. Now go out and make me do it.”<br /><br />Bernie will be our organizer in chief.The joe rogan experience truly is the best podcast in America.love Bernie. He&#39;s just not as good as a marketer of ideas as Yang. also feel that Bernie has mostly succeeded in his mission; his ideals went from left-wing extremism to democratic litmus tests in just 3 years. Having done my part toO elevate those issues, my efforts are now better spent helping the next crop of progressive policy support leave the fringe and enter the mainstream; things like UBI, blockchain, and election finance reform. And so, I must support Andrew YangWhy would anyone vote for a crusty wheelchair stain moaning about pills.How is this only an hour?Thr level of ignorance is beyond me. If you’re going to critique Bernie, at least listen to the podcast. If you’re right-Wing ask your self why and listen to the opposition. Study your contender, don’t just repeat what Fox News says.You gotta get Donald Trump on hereBernie Sanders should really understand what the f*** is talk about the weapons. you can&#39;t buy assault weapons in the United States if it was manufactured after 84 is Democrats are f*<b>***</b> stupid. He also ignore the fact that rifles only kill 300 people handguns 36,000 which most are suicide.If you make more than $32,000 a year.<br /><br /><br /><br />.....<br />....<br /><br />....<br />You  are a part of the richest 1% of people in this world.the shit bernie said about the gun show loop hole is bull shit just a leftist talking pointFeelin the bernFuck off commieEveryone that reads this i hope you get what you want in life ❤Can&#39;t believe my man did it, getting bernie on here is huge.Bring Donald TrumpI was with my Dad this morning and on a right wing radio station, they were saying that mass shootings are the price that we pay for freedom. Oh really? I&#39;m so flattered to be able to die in YOUR cause. No, actually, I&#39;m not willing to put MY body on the line for your insanity. But apparently, this is the reality in this country that we deal with, people being enlisted in culture wars, proxy wars and urban street battles for the cause of some talking heads on television and radio.Thought  u were a Tulsi shill🤨Yeah dawg, but taxes killed John LennonThis made Bernie seem much more reasonable.  I think we&#39;re going to see his polls rise and it will lead to everyone wanting to be on Joe&#39;s show.<br />Here&#39;s hoping we get Donald Trump on the show.Really Joe? Your just gonna have Bernie on and give him the whole time to present his platforms and not challenge him on anything? I mean you can be polite and respectful and still call him on his bullshit. Not even on guns Joe?! Really?! You off all people! Ugh. How about assault weapons is a bs term. AR = Armalite NOT assualt rifle. How about they lowered required the # of ppl shot to qualify as a &#39;mass shooting&#39;, skewing longitudinal and comparative stats. How about a lot of times these mass shooters obtain guns from law abiding citizens, furthermore the criminals with guns aren&#39;t getting them at a gun shop and going through a background check! BTW, THERE IS NO GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE! Unless your idea of a gun show is to roll up on a corner, pop your trunk and say &quot;hey people let me show you my guns! They&#39;re for sale! No background check!&quot; Meth is illegal and more people than ever are hooked on that so you think legislation is the solution to gun violence?! Really??! How about areas with loose gun laws have drastically less gun crime? How about the weird affiliations of many mass shooters with government entities? Too many over the years to be wearing a tinfoil hat on that shit.Omg didn’t even see this coming lol, amazing!!!All the Eurocucks in the comment section who actually believe they have &quot;free&quot; health care when in fact their rectums are incontinent over the large tax dildo they have to spread their legs for to pay for such a thing. <br /><br />No thanks. I&#39;d rather keep my money than pay for some smackhead to get their daily dose of Methadone on my tax dollar.This is big , joes not a comedian he’s a talk show host.Bernie seems so collected here. It&#39;s refreshing to seeso i&#39;m 50, paid off my second loan debt last year...so what now...supposed to go learn software developing? get out at what, 54-55...sure that&#39;s hireable...I want Rogan get one these candidates on and smoke with him I don&#39;t keep up with all them but that person would win my voteWe live in a province in Canada that increased its minimum wage from 10 to 15 dollars an hour over a 2 or 3 year period. What happened here was drastically reduce opportunities and working hours for young people, turn full time jobs jnto part time jobs, and put immense pressure on small business owners, causing a lot of them to lay off workers and or simply close up shop. My 20 year old daughter finally found (seasonal) full time work after 2 full years of looking and working numerous pt jobs that would only give her 8 to 12 hours a week. She flat out said she would rather work 30 or 40 bucks an hour at the old wage and gather skills and experience rather than get paid 15 an hour for 8 to 12 hours a week.<br /><br />Food for thought....Bernie...thinks we should check peoples mental stability before they own guns, yet, he thinks theft is 100% acceptable.  What kind of mental stability is that Bernie!?This is the podcast i wanted to happen the mostBig business should not be involved in politics. Great conversation.  now i see Bernies direction.. Trump still gets my voteI can&#39;t even imagine Donald Trump sitting down like this and having an intelligent conversation. How the fuck is he our president?Amazon is the epitome of corporate welfare......Bernie doesn&#39;t want to talk about how federal student loans is the cause of jacked college costs...same goes for housing...healthcare...and anything else the government touches. Opens the door to massive fraud.I just had a pharmaceutical ad run during this show. Oy vey.I love bernie but he knows absolutely nothing about guns or gun laws.Preaches a solution and then admits he doesn&#39;t have a solution😂😂😂Joe is trying to become a vice president for that key to the book of secretsZero pushback from joe. Twitter interview all over again.<br />Please get Tim Pool on here to help you joe.Glad 2 see u decided to hop on Joe&#39;s show Bernie. I&#39;m always interested in hearing people that I believe tell it how it is n not sugar coat 💩. Always good 2 get 2 know ppl better on as close 2 a normal conversation as you can get with certain ppl in his position can get. As much as I like 2 hear ur position like at the senators a while back sometimes u give 2 much of a red flag 2 those who obtain a lot of persuasive power in the US. Kinda got that message last election...Just a radical hypothetical, but if let’s say all doctors, nurses, medical practitioners and technicians were to drop dead ( I did say it’d be radical) then where would we get our right to medical care? The government?How can you dislike this dude? Regardless of party, he is for the little man. Trump claims to be and used it for his political gain. This guy actually fights day and night for the down trottedBrilliant!  He&#39;s basically Chomsky lite.Hit the Thumbs Down button on this Podcast if you hate yourself and dream fondly of getting T-bagged in the face by Hitler&#39;s underdeveloped testicles while your parents watch in disappointment! 😃How many lives does Marxism have to destroy before people understand? In all seriousness, when the socialists in this country see the countless tragedies and failures of Marxist governments, both in modern times and times past, why do you think this time will lead us anywhere different? Standards of living are the greatest for all classes in those countries with more free market policies. The state is not your friend.Why does Joe continue to say “And we’re live” when he doesn’t stream live anymore?Joe put the mic about a fist away from Bernie’s faceIntense and bleak. I feel like I’m caring a tombstone around in my back pocket after listening to Bernie speak.For real though  the thoroughness of y&#39;alls discussion should be mainstreamBillionaires don&#39;t like the tariffs, sanctions or the clamp down on illegal immigration with a wall. Trump clearly isn&#39;t in the pocket of billionaires as much as Bernie suggests. <br /><br />Good interview though was nice to hear him out!Fuck this communist piece of shit!!It costs $180,000 to study medicine in Australia - not cheap. But nobody complains because the government does interest free loans that you pay back when you&#39;re making money. In America the loan is your responsibility. America - the land of responsibility.I wish people stayed longer, even if &quot;Busy&quot; - thing is Bernie got all his talking points out and was getting to the part where he might actually have to go off script and have a normal conversation like any normal human being for a bit. But oh &quot;your hours up&quot;, gotta run. All in all I&#39;m glad he did this but... wish the Joe Show was 2 hour minimum unless Joe ends it because your no fun to talk to. He kept saying &quot;oh were getting deep, we don&#39;t talk about this much&quot; ya cause you do 30 second to 5 minute spots all the fricken&#39; time. Stay a while and chat man.Second amendment is not about hunting.What a fucking idiot!! I dont think he believes his own shit!if federal &amp; private student loans are forgiven it would literally renew my faith.Why don&#39;t you ask him some real questions like how do you offer Medicare for all with open borders, why did he say millions of Americans in soup lines is a good thing, or calling for reparations? Your so hard on all your other guest but you pussy foot around on Bernie.More importantly, why aren&#39;t high schools providing better education? college may be important, but basic &quot;free&quot; education, is lacking... meanwhile I&#39;m paying more and more in bonds and levies every year and kids are being served less and less.  so is &quot;free&quot; college actually going to help, or is it going to line the college&#39;s pockets?If almost every Democrat candidate wasn&#39;t calling to give all illegal immigrants healthcare, you might get more independents to back this kind of healthcare. You can&#39;t get that in Canada. You get deported after you get any emergency care completed to stabilize you.Breadline Bernie fooling the young promising everything for free.Bernie go on Chapo.<br /><br /><br />Joe Rogan, also go on Chapo.can anyone one explain why they don&#39;t like Bernie but with actual facts not just something they heard and believe...<br />politics ain&#39;t my thing but Bernie doesn&#39;t seem like a bad person...Get Donald Trump on the next podcastJust how?Bernie &gt; kanyeReal minimum wage is always zero. People can&#39;t afford, housing healthcare or schooling because you government fools put your fingers deep in those pies and their inflation rates skyrocketed. Get a clue you grumpy old codger.their gonna have to do something extreme to stop him this timeLost respect for joe for this one he would never have trump on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m37s">1:04:37</a> &quot;After Pearl Harbor, we had a war in the East with China and a war in Europe with Hitler. &quot; - Bernie SandersUnsubscribed.  Sanders is a lunatic Joe. Thought you were smarter than that.About time Joe!Oh man.... this is a tough one. Do I think he is the devil? Of course not. But man.... the healthcare thing.... just because you dont pay money to go to the doctor does not mean you dont pay for it in taxes. Bernie&#39;s idea of free is not really free. We would have to pay for all of it. You think that the people that actually make a difference in the economy will have any incentive to do what they do if they get taxed to death? Of course not. Socialism is not just a matter of people keeping the fruits of their labor or not, it&#39;s a matter of freedom and tyranny. You simply cannot trust people with that kind of power to be benevolent. I&#39;m glad he isnt a warmonger for the most part, but our economy would tank with him in office.Ah FUCK!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣He had me until he started with the Climate Change rubbish.  Anyone who knows anything about climate change (Randall Carlson episode 606 JRE)  will tell you it&#39;s all a hoax.  Before you jump in and say I obviously don&#39;t know anything might want to actually watch the episode 606 and see for themselves.  So sad that Joe didn&#39;t listen to one of his most scientific and knowledgeable guests.you need to bring trump in now. it is a podcast we do not deserve but it is one we need.These politicians dont seem to realize we have lost faith and trust in their motives, promises, and over all productivity. Why on Earth would we want to give over what little self reliance and choice we have? Quit treating us like fools. Its a mutual respectFuck his tax returns demand Trump show the Alien filesYang setting trends <br /><br />Yang/Gabbard 2020Wow I thought I was a trump supporter but now I think I&#39;m gonna vote for Bernie!Joe should be moderating the debates, and he should be allowed to call candidates out for giving non-answers.Oh my goddddd!!! I was just thinking about how badly I wanted Bernie on here!!!I like the last question about Aliens that if Bernie becomes the president will he let us know about it?They spend 1 half of what we do with less than a quarter of our population  .. the per capital is misleading... in order to have free healthcare  for all taxes would be exponential! I agree with free healthcare as a human right but to say you can do it without taking money from people  is a lie .. imo people  should just except the terms n pay the taxes necessary  for it to happen .. think about  it the average American  spends hundreds of dollars every month  on health insurance  anyway, you take that away n add free healthcare at the expense of a tax itll still be cheaper..easy if you do it by percentage  .I disagree with Bernie, but it&#39;s hard to dislike someone who clearly just wants to helpwhy doesn&#39;t Joe smoke week during the podcast anymore?I wonder how it would have went in 2016 if the candidates went on joe roganBern is a moronJoe rogan for presidentpeople can&#39;t track conversations with this many numbersHell fucking yesJoe give him a glass of water for god sakesJoe “No Pushback On Assault Weapon Definition” Roganwhy only an hour joe?Bernie is not someone I agree with politicaly but you can tell he is a good man with a good heart.Kept laying up to Bern. Glad it was only an hour.I did a genuine double take when I saw the title. Thank you, this made my day.if everyone of these ideas is supported by the majority of the american people then why didn&#39;t the majority of the american people vote for a person the represented those ideas people bernie ? hmmmmBernie is so damn rightI have a lot more respect for Bernie after this, just don&#39;t like his policies.Wow, look at views in 1 hour. That is crazy!Now we all know what Bernie is like when hes highI think we need debt forgiveness for any bad decisions... like the car or house that’s really out of your price range but you still buy it.. or that latest gadget you really don’t need but impulsively bought.Thanks joe think back to 1965. It’s relevant.  He is so full of shit.This guy can go fuck himself. I’m voting for TRUMPI don’t trust Bernie! He doesn’t look you in the eye!I disagree with most of his solutions to our nations problems.  But, I enjoyed listening to him and hearing his point of view.  Well done.Bernie2020 🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾Don&#39;t call my rifle an &quot;assault weapon&quot; because it&#39;s black and scary looking...that&#39;s racist.  <br />It does the same thing as every other gun in existence.Gun shows require a background check. If you attempt to buy at a gun show and red flag on your background check you WILL be arrested.Loving these people saying Sanders has no shot at POTUS...heard the same thing about Trump.Bernie talking to children about going to Russia. Haha. <a href="https://youtu.be/MyAqR-ubEq8">https://youtu.be/MyAqR-ubEq8</a>Commies gonna communeSuprised he didnt offer him a joint lolA heart transplant in Canada? Those Canadians come to America for surgery so they don&#39;t die from a poor healthcare system, hospitals and surgeons. Wait time anyone? Talk to a Canadian.Please get Kamala Harris on the show. Bring Tim Pool too. She needs to be exposed as a liar and a fraud.Preach, brother Bernie! Preach!I’ve been yanggang but Bernie just reminded me how much of an incredible candidate he is, truly a man of the people regardless of all the nonsense propaganda from MSM and ignorant conservativesI live in Norway and I can say it is relaxing and reassuring KNOWING if I get ill or hurt I get the healthcare I need for free. When it’s free one can focus on getting healthy - not worrying oneself to death about if I can afford this or not. You Americans can have the same, and by the way save 35.000-45.000 Americans a year who die due to lack of healthcare. Please, vote for Bernie for your sake!When you say we, you really mean me.He wants to strong arm tv ?<br />And points out horrible examples of free health care, lots of reasons why he wants your money . He&#39;s like my crazy  uncle come over to borrow some money ?! : /We should have democratic debates on jre...call it debate companionTrump/Pence 2020! But well done Joe for having Comrade Sanders on to have a civil discussion! Very respectable!get Trump on MAGASocialist Ill pass fuck da Bern fukn wack jobThat made me feel good. Thanks Joe and thank you BernieAnd here I was thinking nothing could top the Elon Musk interview....Dont be fooled by this old maggot, he had his chance and tucked his tail in when Hillary bullied him on the Democratic primarys.Bernie the socialist is a coward. The DNC screwed him, and his donors, in favor of Clinton and Bernie just took it like the pussy he is.Bernie sander walks into a bar: “FREE DRINKS FOR EVERYONE!📣🎉🎊😆😩🤤🙏🎉💃🤸‍♂️🎊...who’s buying?”So much truththis man will be president in 2020 🇺🇸BILLION DOLLA CORPORATIONS!He shoulda had Ron Paul on this episode too.NO PRESSING QUESTIONS WHAT SO EVER???YessLove ya Bern!!! But I&#39;m keeping my rifle.I make 25 dollars hr I work in the plants i work hard really really hard for my money but i cant afford good insurance i cant afford to feed my kids good food we need this change we cant keep going like we are going things will eventually fall apart i for see violence in the streets i see people around me seeing what I have and are willing to take it from me and mine God help us allA year ago, the time i discovered rogan&#39;s podcast, it seemed like most of his fanbase were an incel driven,anti lefty, taking Jordan Peterson&#39;s cock in their mouth kinda group.If Bernie doesn’t talk about the stage 3 requirements, then he’s not serious about Healthcare. I worked for a fund that invested in healthcare, and all their funding went into stage 3 of the trials. That doesn’t involve safety, just efficacy.&quot;Fighting against segregation, women voting...&quot;<br />&quot;tell the corporate elite&quot;<br />They were standing up to state imposed segregation, the same state you want more of; not the boogeymen &quot;corporate elite&quot;.TRAP TRAP BERNIE SANDERSDefinitely didnt turn me on towards bernie. He didnt answer questions. He deflected. He didnt elaborate and joe shouldve really pushed him harder. Makes me think even more that bernie has no idea what hes talking about.The look at my face when I read Bernie Sanders! I thought I was dreaming sir!I&#39;m still in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a> but damn do I respect Bernie. Thanks for everything you&#39;ve done, Senator!Everyone wants the free stuff huh?  Didn&#39;t Bernie get kicked out of a commune for being LAZY? How about yelling from his soapbox that &quot;EVERYONE SHOULD GET 15 DOLLARS ABN HOUR!&quot; When he&#39;s only willing to pay his workers 13? But apparently he&#39;s got a lot of people fooled... This moron will run this country right into the ground.This guy is full of shit.Lol BS just said &quot;I BELIEVE IN THE 2nD aMEndMENT&quot;....WHAT A LIAR OMGthe fuckBernie keeps saying &quot;they MAKE THE LAWS&quot;  but he&#39;s been &quot;them&quot; for 30 years.  He roars and roars but never bites.We can’t negotiate with drug companies he says. This is a major issue Donald trump has brought up. The best guy to fight drug companies and pricing is Donald trump.   Bernie would be a disasterunderstanding is more important than belief. i wish you dumb americans would have more damn common sense.How pissed off at Bernie is Jimmy Dore right now?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=21m00s">21:00</a> robots, and kiosks, giant convenient dispenser machines, will bypass hiring humans.<br /><br />Take away law abiding citizens guns.<br /><br />So he will give everyone a living wage. <br /><br />Make oil companies stop producing fuel.<br /><br />Sounds like a plan 👍Lobbies equals bribery to the members of government no doubt about it. The whole system is corrupt no matter who goes into  office. Just like the money system that&#39;s run by a private entity.i disagree with bernie, but props to joe and bernie for doing a real interview so people can make their own minds upBernie is living in fantasy land a socialist with several houses.. I’m sure his offspring are well taken care ofBernie: Here&#39;s the problem.<br />YANG: Here&#39;s the solution.<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YANGGang">#YANGGang</a>He&#39;s basically promoting 21st century serfdom with computers to keep us entertained. <br />Get real commie scum - Taxation is theft.Joe rogan: &quot; we just did an hour so I&#39;ll let you go, you got busy thing things to do&quot;.<br />Bernie sanders: &quot;spends 30 years in Congress and passes zero major legislative bills.&quot;I think I might be feeling the Bern a little.  Never thought I&#39;d say that.  I like Bernie more than I did before this interview.  I don&#39;t know about medicare for all, but I do think there&#39;s a way to get health costs down and more affordable.   If Trump was able to get insulin prices way down it would  help him with his pole numbers in the african american community. (They have a large number of people suffering from diabetes and insulin is crazy expensive.)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m50s">24:50</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m53s">24:53</a> someone make that into a gif please @DiatribeGamer on TwitterBe accountable for your actions. Dont reproduce, if u cant support them.Everything Bernie Sanders proposes is economic stimulus. Education, make workers upwardly mobile and able to better themselves. Healthcare, make workers healthier and happier, more productive, less stressed, more disposable income. Infrastructure, rebuild the arteries and pumps of our economy’s lifeblood. Clean energy, make our country more independent, less smoggy, and a less vulnerable grid. Increase the minimum wage, the people on the bottom spend more of their income, you have active money as opposed to stock buybacks and stagnant money in tax havens. End the wars, stop building bombs whose value turns into smoke as soon as they’re used, stop building trillion-dollar jets that never fly and boats that never cruise, invest that money. <br /><br />He wants to do what works. He is the only politician with that guiding principle.The Tobin tax should have been implemented 10 years ago...Bruh have him back on for more than an hour. This was enjoyable.I can&#39;t trust anything this guy says, or anyone says  I want sources and facts and stats. People take his word for it because ehe sounds convincing. Who is he to tell me what someone else believes in? Fuck that.Joe Rogan really used fresh-out-of-college kids as an argument against raising the minimum wage..... what. At 18 minutes in. Arguing that the minimum wage might be ok right now cause it’s for entry level low skilled and fresh out of college people. Wtf?Joe your said their isn&#39;t fully formed but you think it&#39;s ok to smoke pot comeAmericans are too stupid to vote for this man. They think they will lose their money...and fear drives them to vote against their own interests.Okay I’m subscribing now!WHAT?  ONLY ONE HOUR?   YOU GUYS ARE SLACKING.  Sorry for yelling.You say that the world has changed and that free education should be extended to college to better prepare them for a more technologically advanced society.  Are you going to require people to go in to STEM fields?  I highly doubt it.  I am sure you would prefer that they go into an activist discipline such as gender studies because the people coming from those fields would be much more likely to vote for you than those coming from STEM fields.Holy shit😂Bat shit crazy old man. I would never in my life vote for this man never ever ever.raising minimum wages will raise the cost of everything else. every single time they raise minimum wage this happens. how man pop cans do you want to the homeless to collect for a bottle of water? last time they raised minimum wage one dollar my job fired 6 people and my work load increased to compensate.Yo Joe you should get Jesus Christ on the podcast. Not many people may know him but he&#39;s got some crazy stories!Even if he got elected for two terms he would not be able to make these changes. Punish the 99% of gun owners for the one percent of nutsYou ain’t taking my job!!! Oilfield trash making that dirty cash to feed my family!!!! Good luck lol<b>FUTURE PRESIDENT DETECTED</b>You done fucked up bringing politics on the show Joe.. now all anyone can do is argueA country where you have to earn healthcare, but where ease of firearm accessibility is a priority. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23neoliberalism">#neoliberalism</a>I like Bernie.Ladies and Gentlemen now that&#39;s what i call POWER .The government caused the financial crisis of 2008. There are many actors excuse me bed actors involved. The government being the biggest one of all. Bernie makes it sounds like it was just a financial industry the did wrong when it was his constituency the advocated the financial industry to take such risky behaviorJoe Rogan, you mad man, you did itCollege was not free 15 years ago. How is Joe not calling him on this bullshit?Get Trump On Joeseph! Would be nuts!!! But might be the greatest thing ever!Who else realized this is the first time I&#39;ve seen him without him yelling and looking like he rubbed his hair with a balloon. He actually looks like a person rather than a Muppet washed on hot.On the topic of free health care, 30 year old canadien guy with a kid,. I wish Bernie would bring someone from Canada to discuss the up&#39;s and down&#39;s of free health. The only upside its free, that&#39;s it. Yes it&#39;s pretty cool. Down side, Service is horrible, nurses are paid shit, the wait is horrible, you will die from a cold before getting served. Now if you have a family doctor like me, you will get better/faster service. But it&#39;s impossible to get one now, and that&#39;s the hospitals are ALWAYS full of poor/unemployed/no family doctor.<br />My personal experience with my kid, when he was a baby, I had to go to the hospital 8 times, each time minimun 10h wait time for 15min treatment. Why? At night there&#39;s only 1 doctor with a handful of nurses. No doctor wants to work in the public, there&#39;s no money, they all go private.<br />Another Exemple :  I had to get a small emergency chirurgie 2 weeks a go. Free hospital, months and months of wait. Fuck that. I called a private clinic Monday and Friday same week, I had chirurgie. 1500$ from my pocket. Fucking worth it and I&#39;m middle class,not rich at all.<br />I can go on for ever.I want to vote for democrats because they have the right ideas on fixing this runaway capitalism we&#39;re getting rekt by, but then people like Sanders want to ban guns because, &quot;they can kill people.&quot;<br /><br />Special note: The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban wasn&#39;t &#39;repealed by Republicans&#39;, as said by Sanders. It was a 10-year ban intended to view the changes to violent crimes committed by these guns and if removing them from the general public would be effective. It was found to be neither beneficial in curbing violent crime, nor detrimental in stopping citizens from defending themselves.Joe prepared a brilliant interview, the aliens one at the end 🤣 I struggle to argue with anything Bernie said thoPay the debt and then we will talk about medicare for all. When i say all, i don&#39;t mean illegal immigrants.Don’t like Bernie but I was surprised you got him on as a guest<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernieforprezi">#bernieforprezi</a>Bernie 2020 🔥🔥🔥Seeing all these well articulated and pensive comments that seem so common sense in their approach really gave me the boost I needed this week. Great show, with a phenom of a guest and my favorite host discussing topics that matter to me. This is why I&#39;ve been a subscriber and avid viewer for over 5 years now.Joe, WTF...get Bernie some water!“Marijuana ain’t Heroin” you damn right Bernie 😭Surprised to see Bernie sit down with Joe. Fuck Bernie though. And more so, fuck socialism.&quot; BUt hOw aRe yOU gOinG tO pAy fOr iT? &quot;So ... (I care about no one), he’s had Tulsi, Bernie and others... would he have Don on? (Trump probably wouldn’t but) ...or would ol’ Rogan not want that jazz? Just saying.Our education systems needs a COMPLETE restructure as well.<br /><br />And should we legalize all drugs?<br /><br />What would happen?i think Bernie needs to understand nothing is free.Man I’m not gonna lie why did they choose Hilary over Bernie :(They really got Bernie Sanders on here 😂JOE, IT IS LEGAL BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS.I don’t agree with socialism but I think the fact that Joe got Bernie on is pretty awesomeBernie might be legally retardedMight as well have had a brick wall onSanders made some really good points throughoutReally rooting for this guy, I live in Scandinavia and for us over here the American election is just another fucking reality show, and it seems like it’s only getting worse and worse. Hope you guys’ll have a national revelation and see how fucked up your system really is. But then again, it’s easy for us so shame another country for being different 🤷🏼‍♂️no ones going to bring up how many Business closed in Cali after the min wage hike? *rabble rabble Well were spreading the hurt out to all the business so they all suffer Rabble rabble.  Joe brings up an idea of splitting the difference based on age (not a bad idea since we already have separate child labor laws that cover hours...) bernie: no.I can&#39;t watch this anymore.  Joe has Jamie fact check everything questionable on this program, except when it&#39;s a political candidate.around 6 minutes, he claims canada spends about half of what the US government spends per capita, lets correct that, america spend around 9400 per person, where canada spends around 6900, or only about 150% of a difference, and not even quite that muchWOW Im glad FINALLY he&#39;s saying that the drugs are causing these symptoms in people!Anyone else feel like Bernie just doesn&#39;t go deep enough? Thought everything he said was sensible but just felt like he was way too surface level on things. Idk.. I guess Andrew Yang spoiled me in that aspect.Talk about the 1%, here we have two rich ass white dudes who have more money in their banks than 99% of the rest of the country talking about what is best for the rest of us. What do they know about struggle with their millions and their privileged life styles. How many families could they support and house with all their real estate and bank accounts. And you lap dogs just lick the masters hand. Beg for your scraps, mongrels.When do you know you made it? When presidential candidates are on your podcast.Jordan B Peterson would like to remind the haters one thing:<br /><b>Rule #9 - Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don&#39;t.</b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YANG2020">#YANG2020</a> WHOSE WITH ME?Holy scripted. Jesus. Feel the bern tho 🔥Free education!Man, Bernie has great ideas and is a good person, but he&#39;s boring as fuck. No charisma at all.I don&#39;t agree with all he says but that fact that he would appear and speak his mind and it&#39;s not on Twitter... I respect itHey Bernie the reason why the top have been able to accumulate that amount of wealth is because we got off the gold standard in 1971. Why don’t you ever talk about currency manipulation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m39s">1:04:39</a>..Empire of Japan.Get Trump on next and smoke some DMT with himTrue definition of a politician.....<br />Talk around your questions.....Yeah the minimum wage thing is what deters me about Bernie do people not realize that once it goes up to $15 the prices on everything are going up and the people in the middle are getting fucked even moreJoe shilling as usualFuck CNN, fuck MSNBC, fuck FOX!!! Podcasts = Real news.Joe, you should check out your episode with Hamilton Morris who provided an eloquent educated argument explaining why these drugs aren&#39;t necessarily leading to violence and suicide.Vote ANDREW YANG 2020This will be another @Jack.sorry but I aint even going to listen to this Bernie when his own party stabbed him in the back should have had big enough balls to go to have his own party investigated ..period... but see he is bought that is why he is right back with his old slave trader partyJoe don’t fall for this imbecile’s bs. His heroes are Lenin and Marx. He’s a hypocritical douche. Yeah I’m going to trust his facts. I would love to talk to this clown. I would eviscerate him with these little things called facts. HahaIts 4 minutes and 40 seconds maximum per political broadcast in an election in the uk, not 30 minutes. The rules can be found here - <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/16250/ppbrules.pdf">https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/16250/ppbrules.pdf</a>bernie is the man don&#39;t be fooled don&#39;t play into the estabilishmentI want the guy to win and get his way so we can establish that socialism/redistribution of wealth doesn&#39;t work. Free market capitalism is the only way I want him to be the one who proves the government should butt out and stfuJoe should have Gabriel Iglesias onSo  .... what fillips this dude out when talking to media or the other dems he should be independent....<br />Has  good ideas.......<br />And really get to see that flake news is ruining America....<br />Starting fires ... and pouring gas then putting these guys in to it ....<br />Media should be fined for slander and misinformation hard enough to causes a restructure ....Three minutes in and Bernie is already talking about what should be freeThis was a solid conversation. Wow.Not a fan of Sanders or his politics but props to him for showing up.Lmao. Love how Joe fit in the alien question in the last min. I was waiting for it!I live in New Zealand, and this guy makes some good points. It seams,<br />and only seams from the outside that Americans  are taught that if anyone proposes an idea that challanges ingrained culture, that they have to be offended and fight that idea till the bitter end. Even if it makes perfect sense.I can’t listen to socialist/ communist say things .  Podcast are a human right, free podcast for everyone ! Bernie never did nothing SandersDamn i wish this could have been a 3 hour podcastJoe: how is that legal??<br />Bern: BECAUSE THEY MAAAKE THE LAAAAAWSI can imagine it would be difficult for Joe to balance opening up to an interviewee and getting him/her to discuss freely with challenging his/her views. I wish he would have challenged a bit more on this one though.This was great! There&#39;s no need to be antagonistic in order to hear someone out.  Great show!Bernie Sanders wants to break the wheel of corruption.Bernie for president!!The tragedy of American poltics he&#39;s right on the money literallydamn joe youy didnt call him out on any of his bullshitNO WAY...Getting my popcorn ready for the clowns who are gonna argue politicseverything is free but we won&#39;t touch your stack.....who&#39;s the comedian in this conversation?When America elects this man, it will move onto a positive trajectory. He&#39;s everything the country needs in a politician right nowGreat episode.oh yeah it doesn&#39;t sound too radical, healthcare for all, he also leaves out the fact that they want to give free healthcare to any illegal alien crossing the border.. just happened to leave that out.. clown ass, you ain&#39;t fooling anyone.. i thought joe rogan would push him on this, but its clear its just a DMC platformImagine Joe&#39;s ratings if Bernie snuck back to announce aliens... 😂This guy is not charismatic at all. How come is he so popular?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h05m30s">1:05:30</a> &quot;... some of has to do with lobbyists, and some of it has to do with merchants-of-doubt ...&quot; <br /><br />And some of it has to do with an appropriate <b>general distrust</b> in the scientific community as a whole, based on the insane levels of political-weaponization of unsettled science (aka gender &quot;theory&quot;). <br /><br />Tell people what they <b>know to be false,</b> and you lose credibility. And then they&#39;re unwilling to listen to you, when you warn them about what dangers obviously loom. <br /><br />Nor does it help that the warnings have been, arguably, overly-enthused for decades.Another point, orange &quot;stable genius&quot; man baby, only won because 32% of democrats failed to show up to the polls in 2016, please vote!!!!Thank you Joe for having a true socialist on your podcast. Bernie will finish the destruction of our country if elected president. Free free free free. The thing about socialism is you eventually run out of other peoples 💰. Nothing is free. Capitalism works.get trump onI&#39;m SO glad that Joe had him on! I find politics so incredibly hard to sit down and digest, especially the debates. I find the format of politics to be incredibly hard to find out information about and to research and this podcasting, conversation type of format is so much easier to take in<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m51s">24:51</a> before it becomes a gifToo bad he talked alot to people who already agree with him missed a big opportunity there. No not everyone knows what information Bernie Sanders is using to determine what hes talking about.Well you know lets break all your questions up and give two answers wtf.Bernie&quot;marijuana ain&#39;t heroin&quot; SandersWow joeHow fking stupid are people that they still in 2019 dont believe in climate change? UnbelieveableI think it is time for strait white men to step aside and let a minority or woman candidate have the platform.Can someone timestamp his gun control talk? I wanna know what Joe says to him.This made me appreciate Yang&#39;s appearance on JRE more. I dont think anyone can really argue the injustices that Bernie talks about, but Yang has proposals for many of these injustices. Although, I would like to know more about what Yang thinks about these mass shootings.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>bernie sanders literally said that if he is president he will come on joe rogan experience and tell us about aliens. how could you not vote for this manWow, excellent guest Joe! Can&#39;t wait to listen😀😍Legalize opioids case solvedBernie wants to tax people investing in the stock market to pay for everyone’s college? He calls it “Wall Street speculation”?He was obviously told “go on joes show, he has a lot of right learners and moderates, try to convince them your not a radical” which is why he keeps saying it. Beyond a doubt he is a radical. If Joe knew more he would be able to flush that out.Kratom is the cure for the opioid epidemic. It&#39;s all about harm reductionI would pay top dollar to see Sowell debating Sanders. Joe, make that happen!You have to address the cost of health care as well as the health of the public.  Just addressing who pays the big bills just means the medical industry can charge whatever they want knowing the government has to pay the bill. <br /><br /><br /><br />Raising the min wage is not a good idea. Universal Basic Income would be a much stronger solution. Raising the min wage has shown the potential to raising crime because young teen boys full of testosterone suddenly can&#39;t find work. When if they aren&#39;t from a wealthy family are feeling pressure Bernie is correct many adults working at McDonalds. Years ago in the 90s that was almost all teenagers. Literally at the end of the day in HS all the kids would jump on the bus and get off at the mall because everybody worked at the mall.  Now these places that keep raising the minimum wage are constricting the salary structure of the workforce.  The people that want this don&#39;t understand business. People have to realize that the American dream is not to go out and get a job. It is to go out and start a business.  I support Bernie and might even vote for Bernie although I like Gabbard and Yang more than him.  That said give people the tools to start there own businesses and you will not have to constantly push for Minimum Wage hikes. I say constantly because there is already talk that 15 isn&#39;t enough and it needs to go up to 20 per hour. That said I still love Bernie because the working class does need an advocate.Dear Youtube please make this Nr 1 Trending in America. Thanks.Joe I sadly you are so high during this it&#39;s not even funnyI love the discussion on this podcast. However my question is if we want lower prices by taking out the business model why don’t we just repeal Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 that was signed into law by Nixon?Bernie might have a hard time winning the presidency but damn does he care more about the working class American more than any single candidate in the upcoming election.But Bernie you ate not the little guy you or your kind budDamn, I&#39;m not even a Bernie fan. But I&#39;m hella impressed that he showed up. Let&#39;s see how this clusterfuck turns out 😂Not a Bernie fan but he got his point of view across. I respect that even tho i disagree.Joe:  Please, please, please! Invite Chris Hedges onto your show;  His discussion of the crisis of despair in America is so in line with what Bernie mentions.I only listen to conservative news and heard crazy things about Bernie, but he makes a lot of sense. New respect found here, but somebody&#39;s gotta handle China. I like Bernie he&#39;s down to earth.This guy&#39;s healthcare plan would cover every illegal immigrant in the US. Imagine illegally crossing into a country and instead of being punished, being rewarded at the expense of the taxpayers of that country.Why is there a demonrat in jre&#39;s podcast lmaoObama bailed out wallstreet.I&#39;m not even American but even I know that everyone who calls for an &quot;assault weapon&quot; ban doesn&#39;t know enough about guns.Dont be a irresponsible fuck.. take care of yourself and you won&#39;t need medication!Man this bernie guys in la la landThank you Joe Rogan for letting this idiot come on your show and expose his ignorance good Lord!!Where do they get the &quot;12 years&quot; line from? Ive heard it before but no ones ever explained it to meCanada has a population of 37 million we have 39 million in California alone with a total of 323 million plus in our country. The average wait time for surgery is 20 weeks , just imagine what the wait time would be here.“Joe it is legal because they make the law ! <br />Joe, <br />you’re hitting on the heart and soul of the tragedy in American politics”<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m00s">23:00</a>Softball questions. Didn&#39;t even get to the Women Be Shopping crisis in America. Sad.Medicare for all in a population of the US good luck and illegal immigrants, still don&#39;t know where he is finding the money, Bernie you and the swamp have been getting away with tax breaks for yourself for decades mate.Wow... Sanders is dumbers than I thought. Not surprising from someone that hasn&#39;t achieved anything worthwhile his entire life.I’m surprised that Joe didn’t ask anything about DMTLol at Bernie jumping into the 12 years to the end of the world schtic.He better smoke a joint ?😂💜💜💜💜💜Cant argue the fact that Bernie is a great guy but he would not make a good president,  sorry to say,I&#39;m feeling the Berndid this idiot forget that his communist friends were in an arms race for nearly his entire life... he likely had to hide under his desk in grade school to the sound of sirens. and he thinks the world is 12 years from the end now?Bernie Sanders converted me in 2016. The bern has only grown since then. Yang, Bernie, Gabbard, and Warren would all be great presidents.Why would you have this communist moron on your show and give him the time of day? He doesn&#39;t even believe his own shit that he spews on order to pander to dumb people who think they will get free college and free healthcare and all that free stuff without paying for it. Seriously how stupid are people? Their taxes are gonna sky rocket and they will pay even more then then would through taxes then they would if it wasn&#39;t free. You&#39;re gonna lose even more money throughout your life paying those damn high bernie taxes. And just wait for the stupid CARBON TAX... A tax that the government will charge you for a complete man made climte hoax made up by the corrupt elite in order to carbon tax the shit out of everyone and pocket their money. Climate has always changed and was even a lot warmer at some points in recorded history even BEFORE the industrial boom when it was even impossible for us to have an effect on the climate.  Climate changes in its own going from warmer to cooler going back and forth NATURALLY. And it will keep doing that. The man made climates FATHER Al Gore said our water front towns will be under water in less then 10 years and and then A MONTH LATER goes and buys a beach front Florida house... with the money he made off of the climate hoax he keeps pushing. He&#39;s made millions of dollars off of this hoax. You think the idiot would buy a beach front house if he actually believed the shit he is saying??? You think banks would give loans for beach front homes if this was all true? HELL NO! Al Gore and the banks KNOW this is all bullshit! And it&#39;s only liberal dumbass, useful idiot Americans who are falling for this shit! Climate will always warm and cool by itself no matter what, always has even before the industrial boom before we could even have an effect and ALWAYS WILL! It&#39;s not a tragic problem.... thank God for Trump who knows it&#39;s a complete hoax and got us out of the corrupt Paris climate agreement that was sucking the money out of MOSTLY JUST AMERICA! The rest of the idiots were not even barely paying shit or nothing at all. It&#39;s at at hoax. Again, thank God for President Trump. Anyone who still believes in the man made climate hoax with all the evidence proving its complete bullshit, is is a complete dumbass. And 90% of the scientists who claim it&#39;s true are ONLY the 90% of the scientists that work FOR the United nation&#39;s where all this hoax is being perpetuated from and who are getting paid to lie about the numbers! There are thousands of scientists who are against those manipulated climate numbers and say it&#39;s complete bullshit and want to debate those UNITED NATION&#39;S &quot;scientists&quot; but they REFUSE to debate them because they know they will get destroyed. That&#39;s why they keep saying it&#39;s un debatable and is settled. BULLSHIT.... they know they will get DESTROYED, that&#39;s why they don&#39;t want to debate. Also... by Al Gores predictions over a decade ago, the ice caps were supposed to be mented 3 years ago. And guess what??? The ice caps are not only NOT MELTED but they have EXPANDED IN GROWTH! And no bernie not every policy you push is supported by the majority of the American people you idiot! You will see that when you don&#39;t win the election and when Trump will win in in a landslide! Idiot.... go home you communist who praised the USSR socialism when you went there on your honeymoon! Joe is an idiot who gets swayed up compete bullshit no matter who comes on his show. He&#39;s quite the ignorant dummy who doesn&#39;t know his own common sense facts.They have seen a decline in wealth because of taxes you moron you tax the shit out of the company owners they have to cut jobs and pay in turn💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💜💜💜💜💜😱bernie sanders asmrSoviet communist cloaked in a goofy grandpa person. Don’t buy into his delusionsI love Bernie, but he seems woefully uninformed when it comes to firearms, firearms legislation, and mass shootings. I doubt he even knows the definition of an assault rifle.<b>OH, HELL YEAH!</b>You can&#39;t have a right to healthcare, because you can&#39;t have a right to something that someone else must provide you. How would you morally collect this right?I think the stock market is one of the easiest ways someone from a lower financial status can achieve higher levels of wealth.  I think you should probably be pretty wary of taxing it.Joe had to end with a question about UFOs. That&#39;s the question I was waiting on. Respect Joe. ✊Has anyone noticed he never makes eye contact?OMG. I thought my friend was telling me a bullshit story yesterday. He said he was in a café and saw Joe Rogan talking to some well dressed guy. He thought it was some YouTube leader and didn&#39;t interrupt them. At the end, he said Rogan said secretly: &quot;We&#39;re going to get this MOTHERFUCKER elected.&quot; I went to post this earlier today but thought it was BS. WTF?aaaaaand now the internet is going to explodeDont have kids when you work for McDonalds. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY!!Joe &quot;Can I get the UFO scoop&quot; RoganBernie would make a perfect president ...the man next doorMental healthcare is healthcare. That&#39;s a key point... I&#39;d love to smoke a joint with the Bern!Not a fan of Sanders but this was awesome, he’s much more chill when he’s not shouting about free stuffI like Bernie but Trump will win 2020I dont get it....I&#39;m an electrician from Texas. If you raise minimum wage to $15 an hour and that&#39;s the starting for an apprentice electrician now......Are you going to raise that to $30...then you HAVE TO RAISE THE PRICE FOR JOURNEYMAN AND SO ON...AM I WRONG ARE RIGHT? WOULDNT I HAVE TO RAISE MY PRICES FOR LABORSomeone correct me if I&#39;m wrong - If healthcare is free for all, you&#39;ll have to wait like 6 months just to get an appointment. Waiting rooms will be overflowing. What are the other problems that free healthcare for all bring?Why broke ass people are afraid to take money from the rich? Hope Bernie wins and starts taking money from those greedy bastardsBernie &#39; I just talked to someone last night &#39; Sandersi legit got an anit socialism ad during this podcast lololol$4,500,000,000 / 20 = 225 million $/year<br />Is that a lot?  I&#39;d have to see it compared to other lobby spending.VOTE FOR BERNE!!! why....he said he would tell about aliens...forget about the rest of the crapYou guys aren’t to smart Bernie is the elite may not be a part of the corporate elite but he is a part of the political elite and needs to go the way of the dodo. His first job was mayor at 53 years old.... this guy doesn’t have any real world experiences outside of his little circle. He sold out his supporters in 2016 and his ideas will never work in the real world. To think if you want to put more power in the hands of the government you got to be out of your mind. Corruption and greed exist everywhere but in government you can have power and wealth exchanging the well being of your constituents for both. That’s what Bernie seeks he took his honeymoon in the Soviet Union and enjoyed himself. This guy needs to get out of politics fast.Still won&#39;t get as many views as Alex Jones 🤣🤣🤣Ross Perot was prophetic with half the crazy sounding shit he used to pop!Guns are the reason we are free in America, and free to speak our minds.<br />Once your guns are gone, those in power of our governments take all your rights away.<br />They will have no fear to shut us up and kill us.<br />Just like every country before ours.<br />They disarm the population, then they kill those they fear as a threat.<br />Even our words is their enemy.Vote Yang you nuts, $1000 a month. It&#39;ll change your life.Fuck that old commie fuck. Fuck him.This is a long time coming!!In a 2018 report on 63 active shooter assailants, the FBI found that 25 percent had been diagnosed with a mental illness. Of those, three had been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. In a 2015 study that examined 226 men who committed or tried to commit mass killings, 22 percent could be considered mentally ill.<br /><br />A report from the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation estimated that a majority of mass shooters have mental illness, based in part on looser definitions and retroactive assessments.<br /><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/pre-attack-behaviors-of-active-shooters-in-us-2000-2013.pdf/view?mod=article_inline">https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/pre-attack-behaviors-of-active-shooters-in-us-2000-2013.pdf/view?mod=article_inline</a><br /><a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/vio.2015.0006">https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/vio.2015.0006</a><br />SOURCE: <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/research-shows-video-games-and-mental-illness-are-not-the-cause-of-america-s-mass-shootings?fbclid=IwAR363BUo1CTi5OyYK3keRIoJVVncBZv3JhPUIrSjrL-QYPrfnKPcFB9Wz0g">https://www.sciencealert.com/research-shows-video-games-and-mental-illness-are-not-the-cause-of-america-s-mass-shootings?fbclid=IwAR363BUo1CTi5OyYK3keRIoJVVncBZv3JhPUIrSjrL-QYPrfnKPcFB9Wz0g</a>KARL MARX was a Socialist Father Of Marxism and communism.....The cuck of the DNC!Ita amazing how now Bernie is parroting Andrew Yang. Thanks for the endorsement BernieBernie’s voice is keeping me from hearing Bernie’s voiceHey Joe. Iraqveteren8888 called you out. He said he&#39;s not allowed on your channel to voice his opinion. He has 2.2 millions subscribers. You should probably answer the call you leftist.This is a GAMECHANGERYou making us proud out here JoeI’m upset this was only an hour long. We needed a 2-3 hour show with Bernie explaining his ideas!Pure garbage!!Thank you both for doing this interview.Trumps next.Bernie &quot;we have all these assault weapons in this country&quot; SandersI&#39;m Canadian.  We have &quot;free&quot; healthcare.  We also lose 40% of each paycheck to wait in the emergency room for 5 hours because big bertha has a bruised knee.Overall I think Bernie has a lot of the right ideas but for me he looks like a old weak white man..<br />Btw I&#39;m a German bot Kappa.<br />Trump should have a easy win as far as I can see from here over the pond.Joe, you&#39;ve shaken up the media establishment. You&#39;re a podcast that started with Redband on a couch is now influential enough to attract presidential candidates, doctors, etc. Incredible man.Honestly, I don&#39;t believe he won&#39;t get in this year, at least. However, he makes very good points and this podcast allows for a different, international audience than the one watching the debates and some of his points will definitely be taken on in the next decade: marijuana, healthcare and education.Holy fuck lolJoe! What a weak interview that was. Joe showed him no challenge!this guy is delusional his ideas are insane and completely irrational america is a place you can go to do whatever you want with your life you can get richer than anyone or you can go dead broke its called fucking life! this guy just want to give shit away! if your 30 years old and have a minimum wage job like mcdonalds your a fucking failure  end of story! work hard and get paid thats how it goes your not happy with what your making or upset u cant afford something, work for it and work hard for it your shit ass job at mcdonalds is for children not meant to support your family!!!! <br />GOD PEOPLE ARE FUCKINGG STUPIDI disagree with Bernie vehemently, he has terrible policy, and it would ruin this country. Allowing him to speak and have his opinions heard fully is good though. We should judge his ideas not how he looks/sounds etcI&#39;m an ish trump supporter but he made a lot of good points I agree on and have a lot more to think about in 2020Please, have Thomas Sowell on next so that he can explain to everyone just how radical and stupid all of Bernie Sanders&#39; ideas are.I’m happy you got got Bernie on the show.   I just hope everyone can see how full of shit he isIf minimum wage raises on a federal level why is anyone gonna stay in California or New York? Everyone is gonna move to a cheaper state.This guy seems to be completely unaware of the desperate financial situation that his beloved large government programs are in and how much worse its going to get once the interest payments on US debt are larger than the budget. Your ideology fucked us Bernie and we haven&#39;t even began to feel the pain.Fairly interesting and a nice score for you Joe but I expected more than a Bernie Sanders infomercial.Addressing diseases of despair, often with roots in wealth inequality and poverty, will also reduce mass shootings.Look at this jre still a shill y&#39;ll nighas not like meQuick question what do you think the quality of service are gonna get but things R code on cloak free as opposed to if there&#39;s a profit motive involved? Who do you think is gonna serve the public better someone getting a modest income provided by the government theocracy or someone pursuing their greatest abilities@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=38m00s">38:00</a> Bernie says he wants to ban guns.  Fuck him.  Joe, why are you letting him get away with this bullshit?Huh. I used to think Bernie was a bit nutty with no chance of being an effective Pres. I’ve completely changed my mind. HuhNeed someone from the working class as president???....that dumbass Bernie has NEVER worked a hard day in his life!!So why not go after the drug companies for price fixing?  That&#39;s right, these crooked fucks are taking money from them. They want more control, they want a public union that will ensure the socialists will be elected from now on. And for your trouble, you&#39;ll get that DMV experience on your deathbed.  Break these monopolies up. Stop importing cheap labor...stop letting companies that pay little in taxes, offshore jobs. More government is never the answer, just do your fucking jobs and stop wasting time with Russian collusion.Teachers are paid starvation wages. BullshitJoe “running for president” roganGD he loves spending other people&#39;s moneyBernie/Tulsi 2020✌ Make America normal again👍&quot;During the debates drug companies ran adds on how bad medicare for all is, they are smart guys.&quot;<br />Wow, Bernie said something that was right for once.The reason they can&#39;t pay off their student loans because they&#39;re taking gender study classes in other ignorant s*** like that you ignorant moronHealth care is not a human right. Nobody has the right to demand another person go to school for 8 years and then work as a resident for 5 and then finally become a doctor to treat you while being  300,000 dollars in debt.I used to be a bernie supporter but now i&#39;m a Trump supporter. I still have alot of respect for Bernie. I feel that he&#39;s genuine.Fuck that SOCIALIST / COMMUNIST  FUCKOMG! For Bernie this is like going to Fox News......another alt right platform......the comment section will be a war zone.....I don&#39;t even need to read them.....one comment will call him socialist but the better and true ones will call him a true visionary revolutionary leader.Joe, I&#39;m an awe right now. You got him in here!!I&#39;m sorry, but you don&#39;t have to be right or left to understand the long history of socialism and communism and know where these ideas lead. It starts with a soft spoken Bernie and eventually you have the gulag. Read!This guy will never change healthcare,Insurance &amp; drug companies r making Billion$$$Hey Bernie everything is rising in price yet you want to let everyone in ?&gt; good luck with those numbers adding up!PUBLIC BROADCAST TV and internet for Presidential debatesThe senator likes to refer to the United States as being &quot;the wealthiest country in the history of the world&quot; but refuses to recognize that socialism isn&#39;t what got us there. Sit up straight ya mope, even you don&#39;t believe what your spewing. A career politician who exemplifies the need for term limits.It’s lit!  🔥Tulsi Gabbard &gt; Bernie Sanders <br /><br /><br />She&#39;s the greatest candidate this country has seen in so long.I always want someone to ask this hypothetical question, what if no one wants to be a doctor any more is healthcare still a right?Oh no is this no longer a safe space for neoconservatives?! wtf mannnnIam not sure if he is the 50 billion dollar guy or he is the other president canditate<br />But i think thats Clinton<br />But if he is a candidate who the fuck in there right mind would rather have trump over this guybor hilary thats just stupid <br />Trump is amazing for bringing in money he was able to continue americas pride of being the most powerful country he&#39;s amazing for the country as a name but he simply doesnt care about the peopel whatever you want to believe he is a bussiness man it isnt a new concept to him<br />The concept of not caring<br />Edit: iam seeing comments saying he screams always i never seen him heard his name obviously but never knew who or what he is but he deems quite good and educated and most certainly gives a better image than trumpIt&#39;s not so much the policies themselves that are radical it&#39;s the price tag attach to the policy that makes it radical. Free college sounds great. Except that it&#39;s not free. Neither is Healthcare for all or anything else he&#39;s proposing. Every single one of your parents should have at some point in your life and told you that there is &quot;nothing free in this world&quot;. They were 100% correct. Free college isn&#39;t free at all. It would cost tax payers in the trillions each year. Even if you taxed the 1% at 100% of their income, that would only pay for roughly around 4-6 months. So where is the extra money coming from? The only &quot;Class&quot; left that has extra money to pay for things is the middle class. Even they don&#39;t have enough wealth to handle what people like Bernie want. We as a society need to stop being concerned with what we don&#39;t have and others do. Be happy with what YOU have. There is always someone out there that has less than you and is far happier than you are. We need to stop deciding for others that they have too much. Who are we to even say that? When will it be your turn when someone decides you have too much? It&#39;s a slippery slope that should scare everyone. A rich person who gives nothing back to the society who made them rich is a reflection of the type of person they are. Don&#39;t lower yourself down and allow yourself the idea you are the arbiter of who decides how much everyone should have. As there are always people lower on the rung that think you have too much as well.Debating on watching this. Can someone who has tell me:  Do they address the green new deal?Wow.  Great Podcast.  He has my vote!go to another fucking country Bernine….Bernie, Medicare for all Senate and Congress! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YouFirst">#YouFirst</a>As someone from Vermont, I have been waiting a very long time for this episode of JRE!Oh NO WAY!!!! Damn... Feelin the Bern on JRE!!!He repeated the 12 year bull.  Why do none of the people that make statements like that support nuclear power and are in fact opposed to it?  You would think that if CO2 is as significant of a nearly immediate existential threat as they say it is that they would not be opposed the best technology currently available to mitigate the use of fossil fuels to the largest degree.Definitely paid by the government. This is there last chance to convince the young to vote democrat even though generation z is mostly conservativeFree ice cream for everyone!Greed has always been the greatest threat to Capitalism.  With AI they will figure out how to &quot;capitalize&quot; even more...He loves Canada so much he should move there&quot;Do you get frustrated with the duration of the debates&quot; - Joe on shortest duration podcast I&#39;ve seenIt&#39;s cool he got Bernie on, but Andrew Yang is the answer to this country&#39;s problems. YANG2020I’d like to see a Sanders-Yang ticket. We would get the best out of knowing the past and looking to the future.I am a realtor and represent a few landlords who own a combined 42 apt buildings . The amount of student loan and medical debt I see daily is absolutely insane . Some Kids show 60 + k a year starting have 12 plus student loans, most are already in arrears and I can look at the credit report and it is obvious they will never be able to pay them back in full .I VOTE JOE ROGAN AS MODERATOR OF THE DEBATESSocialism - An idealogy advocating the distribution of wealth among all members of society, achieved through community control over its citizens possessions and means of production. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why socialism? Capitalism would face issues between the rich and poor. This would be followed by a socialist revolution. Having a socialist government would get rid of the struggle between the rich and poor by putting the government in charge of the means of production and getting rid of private ownership of capital.<br /><br /><br />Socialism would end the issue between classes and communism would run society.<br /><br /><br />If you idiots want the government to control your lives, own you and strip your freedom and creativity away vote for Bernie Sanders leader of the Socialist Party!!!Every country has mental illness. These people don&#39;t have to be mentally ill to commit mass shootings. If people are doing this because they are brain washed with extreme hatred or racism,  they can do horrible things without being mentally ill. Just look at the history of the south to see what I mean. There were whole African American towns wiped out by the KKK.Dam hes old<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m15s">23:15</a> When Bernie lost my vote. You don&#39;t cough into your hand. You cough into your elbow...Are we still feeling the Burn!Most comments pro logic, anti Bernie. Bernie comments 80 up votes with in two minutes. Every other comment literally zero. Fuck you youtube and the bots who do this. It&#39;s clear what is going on. This is another case of Alex Jones views being brought down hourly.Joe &quot;I certainly have&quot; RoganI saw highlight videos thinking you were discussing Him holy shit well done well done this is going to be great &quot;right wing Joe rogan&quot;Peter Schiff 2020It&#39;d be cool if you could have Marshall Mathers on the show.The problem with Bernie is that he never-ever tells us how he will pay for his programs that makes sense - e.g., free higher education...”I will put a tax on wall street speculation...on every stock sale there will be a small tax.” (paraphrased)  Well, nice idea (I guess) but would that work? Most say it won’t work because that revenue loss, which would be substantial, would be passed on to the consumer; and yes it would effect university/college endowments that they need to survive. It all sounds great, but most of his programs will not work.Nothing was achieved in that interview. At least Trump gives you answers and solutions to problems. Trump will win 2020, if he actually runs.Great conversation! Thank you for having Bernie on Joehe still got itBernie going hard for that young vote 😂😂I wanna live in the alternate universe where bernie got elected for the democrats, and won the election for president.Amazing!! Bernie if it doesn&#39;t work out, get up to Canada! We love you up here!! Keep fighting the good fight!! Puff Puff PassGreat podcastBernia you are a fucking idiotThis atmosphere humanized Bernie pretty well. He relaxed and chewed his food. He didn’t have to stand up on a stage and shout stupid shit. This allows you to really understand how gentle he will steal from you while he fingers your asshole.This just proves Bernie is an empty vessel, he can&#39;t explain how he will actually do anything.Haha still ain’t voting for this dude, not like he’ll win anyways. The DNC will just give it to who they want.The only problem with the Canadian healthcare is that it takes months or years to get that surgery you need. Most of the time they come across the border for the procedure.Bernie dropping nothing but truth bombs on this podcastl. This should napalm &quot;he debates. Someone is gonna say &quot;Maybe next week you&#39;ll smoke weed with Elon Musk, HUE HUE HUE&quot; and whatever foolish person says this will lose their run for president instantly.Obviously the debates should be divided into 1-on-1 tournament brackets and let the people bet on the outcomes. Winner moves forward.epicRemember when people on the far left used to say Joe Rogans show was a stepping stone for the alt right? LolIt&#39;s fine to have Bernie and I&#39;m glad to hear him speak like this, but...  It&#39;s just more hot air.  Joe isn&#39;t much of a hardball interviewer and he was mega soft here.  Bernie&#39;s views basically are just opinions with no substance in this interview.  I&#39;m thoroughly unimpressed with his ideas.Wish Joe would&#39;ve challenged Bernie more on the following:<br /> -  $15 minimum wage: When challenged, Bernie said &quot;well all the companies would all have to pay it, so it would work out/balance out.&quot; Big difference when Amazon or Disney has to pay a minimum wage, but lots of startups, Mom and Pop shops, etc. around the country would struggle and many would probably go under.<br /> - The &quot;Wall Street Speculation&quot; tax: How does that affect 401ks/IRAs for middle-class America? How does that affect the stock market in general?<br /> - If we have 400 million guns in this country and 10 million assault rifles (that we know of), gun bans would just create a massive black market network for banned weapons. Criminals and the deranged would still be able to access them, and untold other criminals would make a fortune off of it. It would be like prohibition for guns.<br /> - Why don&#39;t progressives talk more about the government regulating the health care industry BEFORE they take it over? He complains about big pharma, etc., but the regulation has to take place first. The idea that government can take over the whole industry in four years is crazy. And when they finally do, like all things, the costs will be astronomical. Not to mention how the collapse of the private health care industry would affect the stock market. Could be a housing crisis like recession with the shock it would be to Wall Street. Also, US companies currently pay, on average, $10,000 per employee on healthcare. Bernie wants to take that money off of big business and put the tab on the government&#39;s bill? Guess who pays that tab?Joe. Bernie is a bullshiter , he has so much shit he is splashin in your face and your trying so hard not to disrespect him, but he is throwing crap more than a chimpanzee would right into your face.Good work, Rogan.Was the wall even mentioned in this conversation? Did I miss it?Sounds awesome. So what are the downsides to his policies?How is this only one hour long¿I&#39;m by no means a Bernie supporter, I&#39;m actually conservative. I appreciate that a candidate of Bernie&#39;s stature is willing to come onto a podcast to have a real discussion.Congrats Joe you are becoming more important than mainstream media..also I&#39;m hoping Bernie will smoke a dubbie like musk did.Bernie Sanders on JRE?!?<br /><br />My nips are so hard...This came out of nowhere! I am awestruck!! Thank you to everyone involved in thisI feel like this guy would really try and change the local impoverished areas. These elites running away with all the money using others and this planet. I feel sad for the future no one cares I feel like and this is all a joke. Especial the hate.  I WANT TO BELIEVE 🛸The problem with Bernie&#39;s ideas on the minimum wage is the reality that Amazon and McDonald&#39;s are not all business&#39;. Your average mom and pop business cannot afford to pay workers $15 per hour. This is simple economics.Joe &quot;politicians binge dmt&quot; roganY’all are pathetic 😂 either if you’re republican or Democrat. Y’all niggas really picking teams🤦🏿‍♂️thanks for having Bernie Joe! Bernie 2020!!!Berrnie is a FUCKING NUT JOB... he just wants your money otherwise he has no lifeJoe thanks for having Bernie on! It helps to get his message out to more conservative people who won’t give him a chance or even listen. No matter what your political views are I appreciate you for allowing him an audience and keeping it real! More people need to hear his message rather than little bits that people hear in the debates. Kudos Joe! Thanks for the experience!! 😊🔥👍🏼If only Bernie had a basic understanding of economicsGreetings from Sweden. Where does Bernie stand regarding illegal immigration? Legal immigration? The wall? Is he like the rest of the leftists here in Europe who have totally lost it when it comes to immigration and created chaos in many European nations?I’ll have to wait to listen to this tomorrow during work...all I wanna know now is; do they  dabble with some of that Tyson knockout herbal stuff!!??? 😱😂😂😂Joe and Bernie maturely discussed with most of the serious issues in America.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m depressed or refreshed (is there a word for refreshingly depressed?).  One of the most striking facts of this pod was when Joe asked how does the 1% has the benefits and Bernie said because they write the laws.  I think that everyone knows that the powerful could close the spigot of money in America at any time and the close would start when Bernie-ites ask for fairness.  Greed sucks, 40M in poverty sucks, and much suckage is the way it is.The rich get tax exemptions because they hire people that are literate with the tax codes, making them pay more is like communist RussiaMother fucker better have Dan Crenshaw next......Sernie Banders on the Roe Jogan Experience....Anyone promoting socialism is an enemy of freedom. Ask Venezuela.Now look at every other countries they don&#39;t have ok health care bestnote how the money that the wealthy have gained the last 30 years is the same as the &#39;national debt&#39;How can Joe, not question these ridiculous facts. I&#39;ll bet 50 years ago Elizabeth Warren wouldn&#39;t be getting 300 K to teach one class at a university. Jesus Joe, wake up!!!Alright! Bernie&#39;s the real deal. It feels like he&#39;s already won, sometimes.why is he making sense guys? should I be worried?Get Donald Trump on Joe!SUCH A GREAT TALK/INTERVIEW!!! SANDERS/GABBARD2020They won&#39;t even say &quot;white supremacists&quot;... that&#39;s the problem smhbooooooooJoe, when are you going to get Steve Bannon on your show.Zero eye contact... FOHjoe wont bring trump on but owns a gun sends his kids to private armed schools....has a socialist on who literally threatens to take everything he has but still gives him the time. fuck you commie faggots im going to put some fucking bullets in some government if they dont get the fuck off my lawn.Finally! Cornel West and now Bernie. I’m digging this. Please interview more democratic socialists/leftists. Get Michael Brooks on, asap.Bring trump on asap!joe will never have a right wing politician on his showHow dare youIs it just me or does he remind of that one crazy school teacher who got along with everyone?This was a fantastic podcast!!!!Name another candidate that would do this. Really great interview.I don&#39;t know but it was high what a low-information idiotIs it moral for the people who don&#39;t attend college to be forced to pay for those that do? Is it moral for person of modest means to subsidize a wealthy families education?This is how address those who call climate change a hoax...<br /><br />A: Why operate on the assumption that it&#39;s a fake hoax and think nothing will happen as opposed to it actually being real and we&#39;re killing our planet, but more importantly (from their perspective) yourself and your loved ones? Is it worth it to make this a life and absolute death decision? What are the legitimate downsides? We create jobs which increases wealth, happiness, quality of life... WHAT ARE THE DOWNSIDES?!?! <br /><br />The yelling would be because of the obvious answer they&#39;re incapable of answering... <br /><br />Anyways that&#39;s just my thought...OMG that old fossil .... not watching one second of this ...Andrew Yang was here first. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang2020">#YangGang2020</a>Joe - &quot;Jamie pull up the news article where Bernie&#39;s Staff unionized against him, raised their wages, and then let some of them go&quot; <br />Bernie - &quot;Racist&quot;It&#39;s time for a new law: <br /><br />A law that says if a person commits a rampage crime, or commits / attempts suicide the public immediately has a right to know;  (1) the name(s)of any, and all medication(s) the person was on when he committed the crime. (2)  All the name(s) of his treating physician(s).  (3) Further, that/those Doctor(s) be suspended until they can be investigated.  <br /><br />If someone goes on a rampage and kills innocent people or commits / attempts suicide the police and government should be required to divulge to the public all of the things that could have possibly contributed to a persons psychotic breakdown.  Medical privacy should immediately be revoked.  The media, the public, and the government need to look for a pattern. We can no longer ignore the possibility that the medications prescribed may, in fact, be a contributing factor.<br /><br />We can know the caliber of the bullet, where the gun came from... We can know how many people died... We can know whether or not the assailant was apprehended, or if the suspect is in custody.  Also, whether or not he was mentally ill...<br /><br />Isn&#39;t it time to ask the question;  Exactly, what was the name of this persons medication?  And who are his doctors?<br /><br />If there was ever a moment where a persons medical privacy should be revoked it would be in this specific sort of crime.  Over prescribing medications should be a crime, as it relates to Terrorism, Rampage Crime, and Mass Shootings.Love this podcast. I know joe doesn&#39;t align with all of Bernie&#39;s beliefs but he was very fair despite that fact.Joe Rogan 2024Contradicts himself and his values twice in the first 5 minutes,, Imagine being so poor of wealth and mind that this guy sounds intelligent.No Democrat will take away our &quot;assault rifles&quot;  but can someone tell me what classifies as such? Cause just I have an AR done mean shit! TRUMP 2020!Believe in the B.Free education is not an idea. We have it in denmark. Free healthcare to.It only took 3 minutes for Bernie to say &quot;free.&quot; Peace sells but who&#39;s buying?ITS NOT FREE IF YOU PAY FOR IT IN TAXES.I had major heart surgery only in hospital 8 days and owe over 135k:40 seconds in and he takes a line from Andrew yang haha yanggang2020Bernie Sanders will never be president.  Thank God.Bernie loves Canada yaaa ✌️I like Bernie and what he stands for. But I just can&#39;t get with him on his economics/money mindset. Also I like my guns and feel like nobody should be able to tell me how many I can own.Canadian here. I like Bernie. I believe him to be genuine...but he is like your buddy&#39;s super nice dad, for whom you realize to be grateful that his wife is a cold hard bitch....so, if Bernie&#39;s wife is indeed such a vital contributor, then yes, elect them both 👍Thank You Joe and Bernie!I can track with him when he&#39;s talking about corruption in the healthcare industry, but he totally loses me when he talks about the minimum wage.  He&#39;s being willfully ignorant.  Look at all the automation and lay-offs increasing.  And the cost of living in CA?  Duh!  It&#39;s all the liberal social programs there--that he supports--that is bankrupting the state!  Common sense.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PowerfulJRE">#PowerfulJRE</a> Please consider getting Lenny Susskind on the podcast. He&#39;s already quite old and he&#39;s not exactly immortal, so don&#39;t miss this chance.So when is Donald Trump going to be on Joe Rogan?If trump or another stupid politician wins knowing insurance companys and our own government is corrupt, allowing to take advantage of us in front of our face. We then deserve to be treated this way!!!!!!!!Dirty fucking commie.... GTFO.Thank you Joe! Was about to email you this week about having the BERN on! Well done sir! 👍WizardBernie the Godfather of our political revolution has made it to the JRE. Thanks Dr. Cornel West for bringing Joe to our revolution!!crazy Bernie was against NAFTA, Trump tore up NAFTA. crazy Bernie is against profiteering big Pharma. Trump is waging war on big Pharma. Crazy Bernie says Orange man bad.ROFL NO WAY THIS IS NOT HAPPENING ROFLROFLBernie 2020The Real Deal! Most liked senator in the country and has the most grass-roots support then any other democratic candidate.38 minutes in Bernie picks a booger and puts it in his pocket.Where did Joe find Gilbert Godfrey&#39;s grandpa? Ooooo wait that&#39;s just another millionaire career politician Damn thought this would be interestingSocialism will never win in this country, sorry to disappoint 😂<br /><br />Trump 2020 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23KeepAmericaGreat">#KeepAmericaGreat</a>I think Bernie has many good points but I believe that his ways of remedying many of these problems are wrong I believe we need a man like him in our government. Just not president.Did Joe ask Bernie the Commie why he wants to take away his guns?Great podcastThis guy has been a broke loser his whole life and demonstrated absolute weakness last election when he gave up his mic. Communism is cancer. The opposite of quality is &quot;equality&quot;joe low-key lobbying to all presidential candidates so who ever wins give him the aliens infoGreat job Joe! 1 down 25 to go!I like dick and I’m gay and will always love Donald Trump!!!!!!!!!$$$$$$Fuck Bernie and his sorry ass supporters.0-4 years of age is the parents responsibility, not the government.Bernie! Bernie!Does he not have a neck?!Let&#39;s see... I  worked for Walmart for 18 years and on my days off I went out looking for items in thrift stores and flea markets to resell to make extra money for my family. As  soon as trump came into office I was hit with a 45k irs bill after I quit Walmart to start my own business.  Hmmmm. 40 hrs a week the only working person in my family because I have 2 autistic boys, I made less than 50k a year since 2011 yet I have to pay that all back. And I get hit with that tax.   My family vehicle just got recalled. I have more experience in retail than anyone I know besides my father. And only make 12.50 an hour while cashiers can just stand around and management can make 75--100k a year for being douchebags... Doesn&#39;t make sense.  There is nothing we can do. Bernie you can&#39;t help us.  We are screwed.   Unless you are an asshole or a super extrovert you will be a slave to the system. Every one I know will tell you that I worked harder than anyone else, but I will not stand for this bull shit.   That&#39;s what makes people shoot up places.. It&#39;s hate of the government and it&#39;s Facists corporations.  Give us a life and we&#39;ll be happy.Gun laws wont stop mass shootings. Gun laws are infringements of rights its non-negotiableWouldn&#39;t it be great if Joe could get all the D and R candidates on his podcast over the next 6 months or so.And maybe for longer than an <a href="http://hour.like/">hour.Like</a> maybe for 3 hours each.Obviously the President has demands on his time but the others should be available.<a href="https://fee.org/media/14946/economicsinonelesson.pdf">https://fee.org/media/14946/economicsinonelesson.pdf</a><br />Everyone READ this watch againHis campaign is doomed. He is running the same type of campaign that he ran in 2016. Biden is running away with the nomination.So great to hear candidates on a platform like this. It really breaks them away from how the media makes them out to be with little clips and sound bites. Still gonna vote Trump 2020, but I appreciate this!I&#39;m listening.  With an open mind.  I was FOR Bernie.  30 minutes in... He&#39;s slowly losing my vote...The reason the cost of college has been increasing so much is because all of the government involvement. All of this subsidies to universities get all of the loan guarantees of the government provides all of the bull should reasons of the try to force people into getting higher education in many of them just waste away. The reason the fed is forcing interest rates excuse me inflation all props up prices.ask him about the dems stabbing him in the BacKAnyone that doesn’t look at your eyes when they are talking to you should not be trusted. Bernie answered almost every question looking at the table.He&#39;s going to be the next president.I really respect Bernie for doing this. I despise his politics, but as a man, I respect him.Crazy Bernie!  RUN!Bernie will regret the amazing opportunity offered to him. Damn shame that B thought he has more important things to to than to to the one absolutely paramount thing he did for this hour. Still, thank you. Can we please please have President Trump next?Bernie is old news and too old. Andrew Yang is the future! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>Awesome! It&#39;s Bernie. I&#39;m very happy he&#39;s on this show.I hear him talk about a lot of problems. When Joe asks him&quot;how do we fix it&quot; Bern brings up more problemsHe doesn&#39;t believe in the 2nd amendment.  The purpose is to defend against a tyrannical government. Not hunting in the north east.Well done Joe, I don&#39;t like what Bernie has to say, but good on you for giving a balanced interview and allowing him on your platform.So he wanting to raise  the minimum wage to 15 a hour.... What about the soldiers... Is the government gonna make their pay acceptable.. I&#39;m not in the military but im a firm believer and supporter of our Men and Women who fight for our country. I wanna hear what you gonna do about that Bernie.There&#39;s no such thing as an assault weapon. And you cannot buy guns from a gun show with the intent to sell and not posses an FFL. You CAN sell guns in private trades if you did not buy the gun for the purpose of reselling it. People get cracked down on hard for selling or possessing tons of guns at gun shows and not having an FFL since it&#39;s obvious what they&#39;re doing. Also he gives zero definition for what an assault weapon is. I think Bernie means well but he has it all wrong.I like how Bernie uses an example of how someone 60 or so years ago could go to college, get a job, buy a house and support a family on one income. He fails to mention that this was back before women were in the workplace in large numbers (which drove wages down). Before guaranteed, government student loans (which raised tuitions nationwide while cheapening the quality of degrees, women’s studies anyone?). Before LBJs “Great Society” which brought massive amounts of government spending in the form of welfare and benefits and before the Immigration act of 1965 (aka the Hart-Celler Act) which opened the floodgates to anyone from anywhere in far greater numbers than in previous decades (which further drove down wages and added more benefit recipients as well as “multiculturalism”, which works so well...)<br /><br />So here I agree with Bernie, America was a much better place when there was better education, fewer people, more homogenous demographics, more women at home raising children and all run by a smaller government that took less taxes to pay for others benefits (socialism was also a pretty dirty word back then as well).If health care becomes free don&#39;t expect the worlds smartest people to keep moving to America to become doctors.....Joe just had to slip in the aliens at the end xDREALLY COOL..... I&#39;m Voting for BERNIE.... 💪🏼💯ok... I still think Bernie is still a complete idiot.... he has been there forever ...but still has got zero done.... he never gets anything done.... it&#39;s a sham he should have been a sandwich makerJust stay in the race this time damnitLook trump ..its crazy Bernie..hahahaIf you don&#39;t want Bernie 2020, you&#39;re either rich, misinformed, or a moron. Tell me one policy position that he&#39;s wrong on, and provide sources. Burden of proof be damned.What a fucking hypocrite... never trust a word out of politicians mouth, specially a socialist. Unfortunately Argentina has first hand experience on the bs for the last 70 yearsWhy would anyone go to college when you can make a &quot;living wage&quot; doing virtually any job in Bernie&#39;s Utopia.Imagine if he got trump on after his presidencyHOLY SHIT!!!!!!! Omg! Thank u, Joe!!!Hope this mother fker winsBernie: I think the DNC is in a difficult position.<br /><br />Joe: Did you say DMT??Bernie is weak, so he won&#39;t win.I am not a Bernie supporter but I have to say this was a good move for himBernie wasn’t paying his employees $15 an hour.  He also had to cut there hours to accomplish this.Its sad how greedy ppl are how can you sleep at night knowing you have millions and there are kids going to bed hungryYa but... is Maduro a dictator or not?People watch too much unnuanced Steven Crowder and lack-of-detail Ben Shapiro if they disliked this video. You can disagree, but disliking the video just shows and irrational inability to listen to dialogue. Even though they ironically believe the Shapiro and Crowder are all about dialogue, but avoid debates with any reputable person on what they call “the left”. bless!Bernie 2020!!!Problem here is if Bernie had a chance of winning no way he does this interview.Am I here before the “intellectuals” on both sides of the political spectrum argue?......LNG will make the real difference in climate change. do the research.i dont really agree with his stance on guns like does he even know anything about guns??It is extremely refreshing to see candidates sit down and have face to face conversations on this podcast and others. Massive kudos to Joe to try to ask questions from both sides.<b><i>™Next Donald Trump</i></b> <br />💯💪😎🤙💰🔥🤝🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸People saying Universal Healthcare is bad, yet are fine with paying for private health insurance with a 5000 deductible that doesn&#39;t even cover you for some things.This was a smart move on Bernies part. Yang and Tulsi&#39;s interviews were amazing. I saw Bernie on the Breakfast Club too. Bernie is good in long form.As a republican I absolutely like this lil Brooklyn weirdoYou gone got Bernie Sanders on your show? Damn, Joe!&quot;They make the laws&quot;!! Says Bernie. Oops, that&#39;s myself I&#39;m talking about.. fucking bullshit lying POS.Bernie made millions just being a fast talking politician.Universal health care will work with a 21% vat tax on everything....See the problemOk Bernie, there&#39;s good and bad communities - the bad ones amplify the problem, so community work will not solve the problem, inner-city youth want to get out the activist keep them in. What are coal miners going to retrain to do? PC repair? They are miners? The scientist that believe in Climate Change get the UN grants, the sceptics dont and you dont hear of them - monopsony. - one buyer. The 97% stat for scientists was proven a hoax by Monckton.Policy still sucksRight from the very beginning Bernie complains about the media that’s coddled him for his entire career.Should sneak Mark Levin into one of these interviews and have a real debateIs it just me, or does Bernie sound like a pc Joey Diaz?Why is health not considered a right?“Joe, it is legal because THEY MAKE THE LAWS”#1 if anyone believes that any political party is capable of solving the major issues this country is facing your kidding yourself. #2 if you are for gun confiscation i would suggest you deserve what follows that. #3 weather your left or rightwing you have been brainwashedShould&#39;ve had Ben Shapiro on in addition to Bernie. What a great interaction that would be.Saw the guest and joey Diaz voice in my head went &quot;Oh Shit!&quot;That last question. That&#39;s gonna get him elected.Bernie 2020Agender , Chinar , Russiar lol I know there are many other issues but Bernie should educate himself on weapons of mass destruction.  Ban AR15 and AK47 . Come on man . This subject alone will keep you from becoming President.  Other than this I believe you are a good dude .You lost me at &quot;health care is a right.&quot; Free choice is a right, not other people&#39;s service to you. That&#39;s called slavery and last I checked, slavery was abolished in 1865.YOOOOOOOOOOThis is amazing! Great work Joe. This sort of format will hopefully completely replace mainstream media&#39;s bullshit in the coming years.Wow,when this guy is not yelling at the top of his lungs like Hitler he makes a lot of sense . Joe get more of them in this format, both sides my man!Of great comments about Bernie Sanders<br /> as far as the few so-called -ones negative<br /><br /><br />none of you cowards offer the citation even when I ask you <br /><br />what’s been programmed?I don&#39;t think banning assault rifles will do anything except have the opposite effect. You make any thing illegal it just makes people freak out and buy more. Just like the epic failure of the war on drugs.Next POTUS!Bernie Sanders is lovePlenty of Dem candidates been on JRE but no republicansThis guy would be such a pushover president. China and Russia would love him! lolIs he reading everything off of a paper??&quot;Why do we have lobbiests?&quot;<br /><br />Because the government has so much power that everyone wants to buy it so it doesn&#39;t crush them.I WAS PRAYING THIS WOULD HAPPEN GG JOE!Does beinie do shrooms. I don’t wanna watch this but I wanna knowDoes anyone else think that in ADDITION to potentially banning AR&#39;s and tightening up the process of being able to purchase a gun, a solution could be to make it illegal for new sites to report these mass shootings?<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying for every news site to stop reporting, just limit it to only specific sites (though maybe an overall ban is exactly what we need).  I just disgusting that <br /><br />a) they&#39;re profiting from this cause it gets the views and foot traffic  <br />b)  More people maybe thinking like &quot;holy shit I can do this, I can go out a just kill a bunch of people and i&#39;ll be kinda famous for a minute&quot;  <br /><br /><br />Unfortunately mass shootings have become a thing, but what if as a society we make it less of a &quot;thing&quot; or possibility?FinallyI&#39;ll let Bernie Fck this country up just to get him to tell us about the ALIENS and TECHThis podcast is Bernie promising free stuff. Same old Bernie.I don&#39;t like how Bernie so rarely looks Joe in the eyes. What is going on there...Easy just give each kid a gun to protect themselves eh? Bernie tell him burnieThe working class seems to be forgetting it&#39;s place.Why doesn’t he pronounce his A’s like in China and marijuana...? He says “Chiner” and “marijuaner”There is a magical solution to end alienation. End Capitalism. Bring Socialism.Bernie has three houses and hes a millionaire. This guys so full of shit.I&#39;m disappointed Bernie doesn&#39;t really sound like Gilbert Godfrey.I think if you manage to do  medicare-for-all and you manage to do  free college and you manage to make the minimum wage a living wage you will have already done a lot to prevent mass shootings.What an old buffoon. Zero logic, pure feelings and stupidity.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=39m14s">39:14</a> FACT CHECK/WRONG/FALSE : 1994 ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN SIGNED BY MAJORITY DEMOCRAT CONGRESS- 10 YEARS SUNSET BAN - EXPIRED IN 2004 - DEMOCRAT ALLOWED AN END TO BAND - ONLY TEN YEARSNever supported him but I gotta tell you JRE is very very powerful I think his popularity is about to boomlitAh fuck you joe&quot;Assault weapon&quot; and &quot;military style weapon&quot; - oh my God this guy hasn&#39;t bothered to read any of the legislation.  The &quot;military style&quot; refers to the weapon&#39;s appearance, not its function.  The guy wants to ban black spraypaint and picatinny rails.<br /><br />Jesus Christ these gun control people just cannot give a <b>**</b> about the victims.  Couldn&#39;t even be bothered to figure out what they&#39;re trying to ban.  It&#39;s astonishing.The people that are now saying Bernie sounds reasonable here and they didn&#39;t before it&#39;s because you are exactly what he&#39;s talking about victims of  corporate propaganda getting you to think he&#39;s Satan while they rack  in Billions.  They&#39;re spending tons of money to brainwash you.  That&#39;s the real conspiracy.And Bernie with the win! He will now be the Democratic nominee for sure.hahaIt&#39;s impressive how Bernie can keep his cynicism about the State of our politics in check to graciously explain how he sees the potential our country has to change the world and lessen what is in large part preventable suffering.woah woah woah woah woah.... WOAH! HERE WE GO! DONT BLINK!Joe rogan for Presidentwhy only one hour?I live in australia. Been to the doctor 100&#39;s of times over the course of my life. Been in hospital a few times. Never had to pay a single cent.THUMBS DOWN !!! F- Bernie !!! This old dried up cocksucker has been in the government system too long.  He is an old shoe salesmanNot a Bernie fan but as an open minded, pro-american guy; going to watch, listen, and see what&#39;s up with him. Too many people are afraid to listen and converse with people on the other side of the isle these days... not helping anyone.I disagree with a lot of Bernie&#39;s points personally, but I can definitely sense the sincerity in his words.Bernie for 2020 Let&#39;s make America affordable again!graham hancock looks differentDrop all your social &quot;benefits&quot; and lower taxes for all. If the top 1% is finding loopholes in taxes so the workers have to pay... just get rid of taxes!If you dislike this video you&#39;re either very rich or have a low iqWhere are the Bernie bros?White AmeriKKKa will be the death of white AmeriKKKaSo everyone that talks about aliens is stupid but hey Bernie if there are aliens would you tell us. I used to love your podcastHave Trump on!!!!!2.6k dislikes are probably people that are racist and think they&#39;re above other human beings because they are whiteNo one asks tho, who is paying for it?Can trust a guy that have of everything he says is not looking at you directly at your eyes!!!FINALLLY BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!22 years old.<br />NopeI think Bernie’s a nutbag but it’s great that joe brought him on to talkBernie&#39;s the bestSo health care should be free.  Tax payer funded.  College should be free. Tax payer funded.       So who are the tax payers ?    <br /><br />I came from nothing. Busted my ass learning a trade and taking care of my family.  I learned along the way and did what I had to.   But the retard parents working at McDonald’s deserves a leg up because they couldn’t figure out life.     Fuck Bernie.    He’’ll be dead when all his bad ideas implode .     This all is fixed in the home not with fuck wad Bernie.  Stay involved with ur family.  Stop having kids out of wedlock.   And respect law and order.     This dude has done nothing as a life long politician.   No jobs created.  No real bills to stand on he passed.     Guy can’t even look Joe in the eye when he talks.   Fuck Bernie!Bernie 2020 baby!Education is getting worse and worse because the government is getting more and more involved. Just like our health care oops I mean sick care system&quot;You got 3 people with more wealth than the bottom half of American society&quot;<br />And? Even if true: Those 3 people have done more to benefit society than the the bottom half of American society and were rightly rewarded for it. Also why does Bernie stop there, he is in the 1% globally, I don&#39;t see him selling his secondary house and donating it to someone in a shithole country.Conservatives be trying to protect their gun laws, yet when it comes to health care they run and hide their money saying that it’s not in the best interest of America to care for the sick.Sounds like 1k /month will fix alot of the issues!thanks for the podcast! Can we have Mr Chomsky?So many positive comments, yet so many downvotes.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=51m28s">51:28</a> Bernie would kill on Dancing with the Stars if he can spin his way around an issue like thatWas Obama ever on this show? Imagine Trump talking with Joe on the show for like 2 hrs? What a spectacle that would bein this episode, bernie explains why i do drugsThe lurking alt-right was waiting to give this thumbs down lol.Glad to hear Bernie speak in length, excellent job Joe, man of the peopleWe need President Trump on hereTRUMP 2020 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23KAG">#KAG</a>I’m convinced that Joe should be the one to give candidates a real platform to speak about their plan then those fake ass reality show debatesAs a gun owner let me say, not another inch.I wish Joe would have pressed Bernie more on some of his (fantasy) ideas.It&#39;s crazy...people don&#39;t want free health care or wage increase...soooo...health care for all is bad? Increase minimum wage less people getting government help....social security is socialism...it&#39;s crazy the way humans thinkBERNIE FUCKIN SANDERS<br />bernie2020So glad you did this interview as well as your interview with Tulsi.....this is what we need!.....we got burned in 2008, 2012 &amp; 2016 and my greatest hope today is that if the DemoRats cheat him again he does what is normal and that is to leave them behind and run on whoever&#39;s ticket will have him.....I personally will be writing in Bernie Sanders/Tulsi Gabbard in on my ballot in any case.....and frankly if that strategy fails I will be leaving the country before the wall gets built to keep me in.....ohhhhhhhhhhh YESHe seems nice enough but he&#39;s too weak* (and a socialist), weakness should never be put in a position of power...looking at you Theresa may, trump might be an idiot but he knows how to Wield power at least (and he&#39;s not a socialist). <br /><br />*We all remember him surrendering the stage right? If he&#39;s not got the balls to stand up to that then he doesn&#39;t deserve the stage to begin with.So Bernie’s ideas are to basically take away rights and force people and businesses to do what he wants and believes. Bernie Sanders 2020 campaign slogan should be...America...land of the “not” so free.Hold up, you have Sanders on your podcast but don&#39;t get Jimmy Dore on with you.Donald Trump is a narcissist, racist, sexist, hypocrite, pathological liar, childish, traitor, wannabe dictator. <br />Vote for Bernie Sanders!Bernie fucking Sanders...IF he thinks global warming is real, he&#39;s either stupid or knows it&#39;s a con and does not give a shit, soon as a heard that he lost all credibility.The veil in so many people’s lives is going to be lifted after today.This is 4 years too late.WHAT THE FUCK, can&#39;t believe itIn my opinion mandatory psych evaluations should be required for purchasing a firearm.Thanks for having him on.I just got done paying back almost $200,000 in student loans. Do I get any of that money back? Or should I have not worked hard to pay it off early and wait for the magic money fairy to come along and make that debt disappear?He’d have a heart attack like Hillary in a debate against trumpNo, the rest of the world pays less for drugs because WE subsidize them.Double our taxes and waiting times and quality of care will be a disaster. Get cancer or any kind of disease like that which we’re currently number one in success rate and you’re screwed tooIm not a Burnie Sanders guy.  I don&#39;t believe in his policies and I don&#39;t care to discuss them. That being said. Out of ALL the democratic nominees in the country, Burnie Sanders is the only one I&#39;d love to actually sit down and talk for hours with, if for no other reason, to get to know the man and not the politician.Does Bernie hunt elk while smoking DMT weed with aliens who are looking for Bigfoot in a comedy club?<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s entirely possible!Bring Tulsi on the show guys!YES!!!!!!He’s got no magic solution for anythingHonestly love Bernie. But I think I like yang more. Idk why I just think small businesses might be severely hurt by a $15 minimum wage. Honestly I think raise it to 10 and implement ubi.Yang 2020!!!&quot;THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILL DIE&quot;We need more conversations lile like these.Governments more than anything else brought mystery are the ones responsible for the massive wealth disparities between the rich and the core. It has nothing to do with a free societee who engages in voluntary exchange without coercion and force from the governmentWhenever Bernie talks about drug prices, he neglects to tell everyone that it is Americans subsidizing the rest of the world&#39;s prices. We shouldn&#39;t pay less, they should pay more. It would massively increased drug development and research. Doubt the profit motives, look up the Orphan Drug Act of 1982 and the impact it had.I&#39;d sign a petition for all the presidential candidates to go on Joe&#39;s podcast. Not only do you get to hear their plans for their presidency, but you also get a sense of their personality. I feel like I learned more about Bernie Sanders in this podcast than the last three years combined.AlgorithmThis is the future of politicsGet Trump on here. It would break the internet.I thought less is more<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>Democratic socialism is not anti-capitalist, it is the cast that will set this broken corporate capitalism to heal, in the same way that a broken bone is put in a cast so it heals correctly. Conflating democratic socialism with socialism is ideologically lazy. And mistaking socialism for communism is ignorance. Socialism is the society pitching in for the benefit of all, like how the entire tax system is supposed to work. If you like 9/11 first responders, like police and firefighters, ambulance workers, and things like sanitation and public schools, you already enjoy the benefits of socialism. Out of control capitalists fed at the trough public funding, in subsidies the recent 1.5 trillion tax break. have a vested interest in keeping you ignorant and engaged in emotional arguments through corporate media left and right, while they run away with all the new GDP growth. Your ideology is their bread and butter and your cultural identity is being manipulated by them for political gain.Well I&#39;ll vote BernieGreat show, sad it wasn&#39;t longerJoe should try to get Trump on here. Obama went on Maron&#39;s podcast while he was in office so its possible?Bernie. You just literally opened your Joe Rogan interview by using Andrew Yang&#39;s closing line from the last debates. I&#39;m glad to see that you&#39;re Yang Gang.Lol look up companies moving to 15 an hour and having to cut hours and lose employees due to cost... only thing Berning around here is the fever dreamHope this mtfr wins !   Bernie 2020.... screw TRUMP and his nipple suckers, stand in line to get your bibles signed while you can Q tards....You made the laws.  Where do you stash your money?The minimum wage idea Joe put forth is NOT a novel idea. In Ontario, Canada where I live we have exactly that. Minimum wage is $14. STUDENT Minimum is $13.10 and Booze servers get $12.20 (because of tips it is a little lower!) and it works. Period. It is unfortunate that your nation is the most backward &quot;modern&quot; country on these topics. Sad. &quot;Bigly&quot;Fuck you joe! Bernie really?We, the people are to blame when it comes down to this talk about climate change and no one ever talks about the oil hunters and war makers usage of oil.  Addressing climate change even if carbon was the killer, by pressuring the fossil industry will work just about as good as telling the US MIC that we need to stop going to war. Good luck.<br />And so the american public will suffer the carbon tax and wars will continue.<br />That is what we are dealing with when it comes to climate change advertisement and Green New Deal.<br />Never do they talk about permaculture, changing our monocrop industrial agribusiness to local community, or planting more trees. The people are supose to feel guilty to assume the carbon tax, the empire of oil will continue. Who will profit from carbon taxing us? And how will that save mother earths thermostat?Just gotta say...WOW😳...it’s Bernie!!Next up, Marianne Williamson.  Please, please, please, pretty please. I&#39;m begging. 🙏Why the fuck would you have this dumb socialist on your platform? This bastard wants to destroy our country.I’m a conservative. I like Bernie Sanders as a person. He seems like a nice man. I just can’t get behind his politics.I keep being interrupted by Trump ads during this podcast. Please stopLOL 1.8k dislikes, bunch of fucking idiots that don&#39;t understand science or climate or economicsWow Bernie Sanders! This years list of guests has been amazingYou&#39;re a fuckin legend Joe.What a great fucking surprise!I couldn’t help but think Theo Von’s Dad was this age when Theo was 7. Onward.I remember when Bernie said that White people didnt know what it&#39;s like to be poor. Obviously Bernie has never been to a trailer park. Oh yeah, Didn&#39;t he and his wife just get put under investigation by the FBI for fraud? He gonna feel the Bern on is butthole when they throw his ass up in jail 💯%Bernie points out all the bullshit of corporate America. You gotta love Bernie!Finally, thank you Joe! Bernie 2020!<br />This podcast is getting better by the year. Host a Democratic Presidential debate, Joe!Politicians arent afraid of the power of money Bernie, they are allured and corrupted by it.Bernie is the man!Keep in mind the left thinks people who do not like gay behavior are mentally ill so....Yeah &amp; the DNC f@ck you &amp; you coward in supporting Hillary because she&#39;s a Marxist communist just like you.<br />Disarmament bog the people &amp; then they have no rights!     FUCK Bernie Sanders!Joe Rogan squeezing in that alien question was the best thing ever lolThe amount of bullshit coming out of Bernie&#39;s mouth is staggering on assault weapons, he can&#39;t even define assault weapons correctly. Defined by the military an assault rifle is selective fire being able to fire both semi and full automatic, those are illegal to own in the United States now. What he refers to is semi automatic rifles which are used for hunting. By the way the 2nd Amendment of the constitution is to protect the people from the government, so get your facts straight Mr. Sanders.We don&#39;t have hundreds of mass shootings a year that&#39;s slanted statistics that include anything with more than one person killedI completely understand Bernie&#39;s reasoning...his solutions to the problems are fucking insane.  The solution is END THE FED, STOP BORROWING MONEY.usc master&#39;s degree program is $100,000 in case anyone is wonderingBernie &quot;Cant explain how hes going to do anything&quot; SandersGreat interview 👍. Bernie I like u a lot more when your not yelling.  Your on the way to getting my vote.Yea for Berni and Tulsi - 2 of the most reality based politicians I have ever seenThe grin when joe said &quot;I certainly have&quot; <br />When Bernie said &quot;I&#39;m sure plenty of people get benefits from marijuana&quot;This man would be the President of the United States of America right now if it wasn&#39;t for the DNC and the Clintons.Although I greatly disagree with burney on many things it&#39;s nice to see people to have the opportunity to talk about what their ideas areI can’t overstate my gratitude towards you using your platform to give these candidates a voice. Andrew Yang next please.The Brady bill expired via sunset provision because there was no noticeable affect of firearm crimes... it was not dismantled by anyone... just facts.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ADOS">#ADOS</a> are a group with a specific justice claim. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ADOS">#ADOS</a> movement demands a specific agenda with policy prescriptions that address the losses stemming from the institution of slavery, Jim Crow, redlining, convict leasing, mass incarceration and immigration. <br />Without specific measures being instituted, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ADOS">#ADOS</a> are locked out of the country our ancestors built during chattel slavery. Without reforms through transformative government, we will be left to continue living a third world life in a first world country. <br /><br />Bernie needs to keep this in mind if he wants the black vote!!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=37m25s">37:25</a> Don&#39;t most these people think the guns are to protect themselves from an oppressive government as much as protection from criminals?Will Rogan become the platform for presidency?I like Bernie, but I think he’s not ready for what the future brings. Yes, $15/hr sounds great, but I truly believe that corporations will outsource jobs using automation. I think his intentions are for the good of the people, but he’s approaching it the wrong way.He supported Hillary Clinton. That&#39;s all anyone needs to know.Mass shootings and suicide are caused mainly by social alienation caused by our capitalist/consumerist society. Neo liberalism from Thatcher and Clinton brought us this .I wish joe would have took this opportunity with Bernie to ask real questions like why did you dow down to Hillary and why are you under paying your employees? You know stuff like that lolA big part of  leadership is Bering. A man who sits with his shoulders pulled up past his ears is not a man fit to lead the most powerful nation in the history of the world.So Bernie, have you ever smoked DMT ?Why aren&#39;t you being tougher Joe :(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h00m25s">1:00:25</a> &quot;... <b>believes in</b> Science.&quot; <br /><br />That&#39;s not how Science works.Have Richard Spencer on the podcast. That would be an explosive interview.I didn’t accumulate massive debt through student loans. What do I get?Assault weapons. This term doesn&#39;t mean what I think you think it means Bernie. Someone as a gun owner from the state of vermont needs to educate him on the fact, other than that... I think he&#39;s pretty well rounded, but outdated, and old. All of his policies are basically the same as Yangs, and Yang has more to add to that at the end of the day, without saying, &quot;we need to ban assault weapons.&quot;Love thisBernie is the most genuine politician out there. Even though I don’t agree with everything, you know he’s working for the common man and not corporations. That’s all I need. Bernie 2020!! Let’s gooooBolshevik Bernie! Go ahead and vote for a man that thinks every successful person in the world should take care the people that are too lazy to work! You think your taxes are high now!? Looking at 60% and an economic collapse that will make the Great Depression look like the best time in this country! Dude is an admitted Communist Socialist in which has never been successful ONE TIME in the history of the world!If students can’t afford college then they shouldn’t go to college. Or they shouldn’t go to expensive schoolscan&#39;t watch this for more than 20 seconds at a time.Tell me people. Are you still feeling the burrrrn? I’m sure Bernie is. The burn from the carpet that was pulled from underneath his feet by Hillary and her cronies of the DNC. This wimp couldn’t even stand up against crooked Hillary...what makes you think he’ll stand up for the people of this nation when it really matters.I never thought I&#39;d say this, but I really like Bernie, and agree with a lot of his ideas. My problem is how he plans to get there. <br />Also, he wants too much government control,  and I want far less. <br />I&#39;ve gained a lot of respect for the man. <br />Nonetheless,  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>Did bernie get blazed?Get him some of laird’s coffee please :)Come on America let&#39;s put him in the white house !You have to have trump on nowJoe.....please have Donald Trump on.The &quot;Ole Closet Commie&quot; himself.. I can smell him from here..this guy is seriously nuts. who are these BEST PEOPLE he&#39;s talking about... AOC? god help us allOnly one hour? Come on, Bernie. Grow a pair.That’s my president not Trump!Absolutely no answers to any questions just talking pointsBernie&quot;_<i>_____________</i> is a human right&quot;SandersWhy can&#39;t he look at Joe in the eyes he keeps looking at his feet.I thought this was a gateway to the alt right, what is this ?!LONG LIVE OLIGARCHY! BERNIE IS YOUR ENEMY!At the end of the day, Bernie&#39;s only solution is this idea that he is going to be our modern day Robin Hood. &quot;Steal from the rich to give to the poor&quot; theory. That is not what Robin Hood did. He stole back what the Sheriff of Nottingham (government) unjustly, through excessive taxation upon the citizens, took from the people of Nottingham (government), and Robin Hood gave it back to them. It was a story about how corrupt government takes advantage of the people. The rich are not our problem. Corrupt government is our problem. What he wants to do is give even more power to the government thinking that will solve the problem. What makes him think the rich can&#39;t buy them off also?Yang did it firstPot em up JamieBernie is right. Billionaires (Wall Street) telling millionaires (Media - Fox, MSNBC, CNN) to tell middle class people that poor people and immigrants are the problem.Unfortunately this was a waste of time. No answers, just talking points.I saw the thumbnail, and just had to stop by to give it a thumbs down! ☺️LOL. No one in their right mind goes to Canada for heart surgery.  His premise is busted.Next guess Jeff from athlean x then I can live the rest of my life in peaceHere we go with the Canadian health care system story...i am Canadian and I can tell you that we pay 50% income tax and we can wait months for treatments, even for cancer treatments. There is always a price to pay.Get Tim Pool back on with BernieDid he just say you can walk into a gun show and resell your firearms to criminals? That’s a felony mr sanders.I love you Bernie and im pulling for you, but please no more &quot;white people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot;. You have a lot of poor white people in the south that agree with what you say until we here that. The inner city does need to be fixed but you have to help the trailer parks too, their suffering isn&#39;t worth less because of their skin. Ps please beat KamalaHey Joe!!<br />You can do it!<br />  Offer each candidate an invitation to your podcast (maybe wait til the weakest fall out?).<br />Ask the same specific questions of each! (major issues)<br />The others in media/internet will compare and contrast.<br />Voila!  Real answers for voters.<br />Don&#39;t forget Trump!!Having someone else pick up the tab for my medical expenses is my right 🤣How about we put a salary cap on professors and teachers of universities who accept public assistance?  How about college athletes get paid. It would be great if college professors topped out at 50k a year. That would really make college affordable.Maynard and Bernie in the same week? God JRE is awesome.Ide vote for him and I don&#39;t even voteBernie Sanders is a greedy hypocrite. Give away 2 of your 3 houses. You don’t need them!!Bernie 2020This moron wants the minimum wage to be set at 15per hr but doesnt even pay his staff that🤣😂 lol ohh no wait he did pay them 15 an hour but he cut their hours 🤦‍♂️ smh<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=01h04m40s">01:04:40</a><br />Wow, all this time I thought we went to war with Japan.Tulsi &amp; Bernie.....would love to hear a long form discussion moderated by Joe.  They are the only two credible candidates.  Let&#39;s actually see a proper discussion, let ideas win.Bernie seems like a very smart politician,  and honest and trustworthy.  I have discussed this “democratic socialism” with colleagues that are republican.  They seem to think if bernie were to be elected that 70% or so of what you earn will automatically go to the government and all of your basic needs will be taken care of by the government.  These colleagues are STUPID,  but they do not get it.  The large percentage of money to support socialism will come from the extreme wealthy.  None of us are close to being wealthy,  so I say fuck it and let the “Amazons and such” cover that cost by paying their part,  in taxes alone.Wow I’ve only ever heard of Bernie in a pretty negative light before now but hearing him speak, this dude is the real deal. I’ll have to check out his other stuffBernie looks at the microphone and the table more than Joe because he is full of crap and years of sound bites.Bernie in Crowder voice &#39;so I hear this is what all the kids watch&#39;Joe has interviewed other candidates , this isn&#39;t that big of a deal. Calm down. Joe is on top of itJoe needs to get Trump on.Yes the FBI will be taking people&#39;s gunsyou liarHaven’t heard this but I hope Rogan asks hard but obvious question like socialism don’t work now convince me it does , but it doesn’t.Move to Canada bro. You have 20 years left tops enjoy itPeople aren&#39;t finding jobs after college *solution - tax the company&#39;s that the people want to work for trillions of dollars!No way. Awesome!&quot;I don&#39;t have the numbers right in front of me.&quot; Because they don&#39;t exist.Jesus Christ get Bernie a drink Jamie! LolIts clear,   if an american corporation told the government that had a nuke under the white house,   what do you think the us president and senate would do?   Anything they wanted.    America/The world doesnt stand a chance to get out of this hell.     Armageddon is just years away, less then a decade. You cant make nukes safe.We need Bernie in 2020. Get this corruption out of politicsFuck this old hag.I hope that this helps spur change in campaigning, where we hear long form interviews from all candidates. It does not matter where your beliefs lie, this type of interview is what we the people need to hear from our prospective leaders.Tulsi gonna be Pissed!! :)I can feel the burn in this episode and didn&#39;t even workoutTuning off after 57mins....wasted 57 mins. What a lunatic....full of ideas and no solutions to get it done.Im not saying europe is amazing. We have so many issues however, you guys are so backwards its unreal. Most of the things bernie is talking about weve had since the 1960s. Lobbying is called bribery and corruption here. Go America!Bernie seems like a decent guy. However he doesn&#39;t stand a chance against Trump.Waititng to see if young Jamie would make Bernie look dumb or not lolMore people carrying guns would slow down people running in places and shooting it up. A crack dealer goes to a crackhead neighborhood to sell crack. Its common sense. If 99.9% of gun owners would use guns to help people then doednt that mean they out number the 1% of gun owners  who want to kill people. Lol I dont get itWhy is this not at a millionImmigration? One of the biggest problems in our country wasn&#39;t addressed.Love how Joe allows his guests to talk and is interested in what they have to say.thanks, joe. one of your best. along with randall carlson/ graham hancock &amp; most of your heady incisive pods. c2-65!I stopped watching Rogan because he kept propping up and platforming alt right grifters and fucking Neo Libs, but after the Pakman, and now  Bernie, Rogan is slowly starting to gain my trust in him as an interviewer back.I keep trying to fight back against the straight up misinformation and smears in the comments here and the comment I am trying to reply to just disappears.Please get President Trump on the pod cast. That would be a new YouTube  views record! It would also open a lot of peoples eyes!! KEEP AMERICA  GREAT!!I was with Bernie until the gun topic. Fuck no on voting for that.👍I don’t trust liberal democrats who talk about spending and not mentioning tax increases. The two go hand in hand. He’s a nice guy but he’s not the one to lead this great country.Joe, this is not what the majority of Americans think. I know 1 person. 1. That&#39;s it. Everyone thinks the left are loony. We&#39;re 22 TRILLION in debt!!! How the fuck is everything going to be free??bernie is adorable with those headphonesIf u were to go to the local gun show, buy a dozen guns like Mr Sanders said, ant attempt to turn around and sell these guns to criminals, you would never sell a single one because criminals, as we know, have ways to get these expensive things for much less $ than the average person so simple economics dictates that this business plan is extremely flawedSenator Bernie Sanders has my vote in the 2020 primary election, as well as the 2020 presidential election.Too many soft ball questions. I didn&#39;t get through all of it because of the amount of lying Sanders was doing. Joe should have asked him about why he was paying his staffers less than minimum wage. He didn&#39;t even ask him why he thinks Trump is a racist.<br /><br />Rogan has gone full shillNOBODY rails harder against the machine then Bernie Sanders. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BERNIE2020">#BERNIE2020</a>Good ollllll Bernie. I’m very right when it comes to economics, but I’m so confident he truly believes what he’s saying, ( not taking into account the fact that he’s a millionaire and has 3 homes and has his campaign staff reporting him because they want a higher wage), nonetheless, he believes this with all his heart, and I’d like to believe that, rather than he’s corrupt.For all the people who click dislike on a video like this. The thumbs up or down is not about if you like Bernie Sanders or what he says. The thumbs up is about wether you like the fact that Joe Rogan has him on as a guest and the question if you support Joe having important people on talking about important questions of society. If you understand that, you really only can give a thumbs up.Excuse: I only get 45 secs<br />Fair platform. zero interruptions, zero time constraint but same exact sound bites.Joe might as well kissed his ringI love bernie. The only candidate fighting for the people. I hope he is the president one day.Joe you gotta have the one dude no one else would have on -- Trump. Do IT!I was hoping Joe would play a bit more of the devil&#39;s advocateCheersJoe doing great things when the MSM won&#39;t.Social Security and Medicare are entitlement programs that have become sacred. How much do those programs cost the nation every year?Far from the radical nut the right peddles this guy out to be...I hope people can set aside their biases and take a real genuine listen to the content  Bernie speaks of. You gained a fan Mr. Sanders!Bernie Sanders has my vote and I&#39;m an Australian. Now we need Trump on the JRE just for balance, that would break the internet.Respects the second but thinks you can fight tyranny with a handgun ?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m40s">1:04:40</a><br />love ya Bernie but come on, we fought Japan in World War II, not China!Bernie is a bold progressive fighter. Will go down a legend.What the fuckHow can you disagree with what this man is saying? Only a billionare facist or uneducated sheep would, i pity America if this man ceases to existRead the law bernie. You havnt been able to buy an assault rifle since 86...ProgressCannabis has killed as many people as heroin if you include suicide-homcides.  Rich meatheads aren&#39;t suffering from weed, obviously, but most people will end up with cannabis psychosis given enough timeGee, I can&#39;t imagine why drug companies feel like it&#39;s necessary to lobby the government...Holy shit he got Bernie fucking Sanders!!! WowIdk why you dumn muricans didnt choose bernie in The first place thrump and that other twat is fucking useless compared to what this dude is thinkinOmg never clicked so fastthis is a small step for Joe, but a giant leap for AmericaNow joe needs to have someone on who will call him on his bullshit, like Tim pool and jack dorsey.Will we ever have free medical ?? <br />United statesCrazy animal agriculture wasn’t brought up during climate change conversationNo google it&#39;s cool just keep using bots for the likes, it&#39;s all good.Posted 1 hr ago..10k comments. LmaoHonestly I am not a Bernie supporter and never will be. However, I do believe he actually wants to help people and believes what he is espousing. While the other candidates are merely copycats trying to get power. Who in the end, will be just as controlled from lobbyists as anyone else in politics. Thank you Joe for having him on.Hit the like button if you are going to vote for Bernie SandersIt&#39;s funny hearing Bernie talk about raising the wage and he doesn&#39;t pay his own workers $15 hr.he supported hilllary after she stole the election from him.  nuff said...Trump was right,  he is crazy.....Canadian healthcare should not be a benchmark. Taxes are high, and more often than you’d like there are wait lists or delays for major surgeries and operations due to too much demand. This is partially because of how strenuous and difficult it is to become a doctor, but still. Obviously I still benefit from free health care as a Canadian and think it’s horrendous how private health care affects the poor in America, but there are flaws here too.I don&#39;t know why everyone is so surprised that Bernie would come on the podcast. Bernie will literally do anything for attention. He has made a career out of getting attention so he doesn&#39;t have to actually work for a living. As far the morons that want to vote for Bernie, try living in Vermont for awhile. Extremely high taxes and cost of living with very little jobs. Health Care is by far the worst of anywhere I have ever lived. That&#39;s Bernie&#39;s politics.Well i dont think anyone can argue any of thatoooooooohhhhh so excite haven&#39;t even watchedHopefully this time he wins the nomination. I would love to have the opportunity to vote this man into the presidency. Good podcast.World war 2.. Hes says war with China and Europe.. Lol. Ok mr SandersWhere is the right side joe?????Bernie goes for 1.5 hours. Joes worst guests go for 1.5 hours. I used to like Bernie, but he’s a broken record that is clouded by an idealistic reality that wouldn’t make legitimate logical sense. Sorry Bernie. But you have an hour and a half to change my mind. Let’s goooo!!Thank you Joe for having him on. That said. I can&#39;t fucking stand the non $15 an hour paying hypocrite. Can&#39;t watch.Joe Rogen for presidentDamn Bernie Saunders is a reptilian pedophilian satanistBernie&quot;breadlines are good&quot; SandersI am really curious to know how many people would truly be against all Americans having free quality health care, free higher education, student loan debt cancelled and eliminating lobbyists, if it really could be paid for by taxing Wall Street and the top 1%.  I&#39;m not talking about the armchair counterpoints that say he couldn&#39;t actually do that. What. If. He. Could.  Do those ideas sound like they would help or hurt the long term well being of our country?  I refuse to believe the vast majority of American people think it would hurt.I personally disagree with about 90% of the policies laid out as I view them as unsustainable and “quick fixes” however ya gotta love the times we’re all in. Just because we may disagree or have opposing views/solutions doesn’t mean we can’t have conversations. With that said, this podcast reminds me of the kid in elementary school that ran for class president and promised recess all day, no homework, and pizza more days than just Fridays.Still didn&#39;t explain how he will pay for any of this!Disappointed in ya Joe for not asking the hard questions esp about the so called assault rifle issue. I hear that your a hunter yourself so I assume your somewhat educated about firearms. What exactly is the definition of an Assault rifle? Is it a semiauto with a detachable magazine? If so that is gonna make a bunch of hunting rifles illegal. Is it the Caliber of the weapon? Same situation. By the way you threw softballs on the healthcare issue also. You had an opportunity to really grill a possible future president and you blew it man.All I have to say to Bernie; is you are a ball face liar simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m20s">5:20</a> in. &quot;We are the only country that doesn&#39;t offer healthcare to everyone.&quot; Bullshit. Health INSURANCE coverage is completely different. If some one is in a car wreck, mortally wounded and all but has no health insurance. It&#39;s not like the ER is going to say &quot;nope, dump him by the ditch with the others that don&#39;t have health insurance.&quot; YOU GET TREATED. It just isn&#39;t for free. THAT is your fundamental problem, Bernie. Quit playing.Bernie piss away your future on the useless poor Sanders. If fools vote this guy in, the country will go bankrupt in a matter of months.Bernie: you cant negotiate with deign companies......<br />Trump: we will negotiate with Canadian drug companies to open the market......<br />Fascist racist white supremacist..........<br />But hey Bernie is for me.........<br />No Bill&#39;s.............Out of state tuition University of California  $ 40,191.00, to $61, 915.00  instate:  $13,509.00. to $15 ,441.00 per year.Bernie wants to spend billions and billions, guess the money grows on trees!Why doesnt anyone bring up the blatant lack of security in over %90 of schools across America when talking about school shooting?All 2020 candidates should go on JRE.Buybacks are good tools to help get excess firearms off the streets and out of the reach of criminals.  And the mental health issue can be addressed by implementing Medicare for All.Joe is having alot of communists on latelyI&#39;m UK, and over here, we LOVED the EU until they started talking about clamping down on the Uber-rich. Brexit has come about from the same Oligarchs and Plutocrats using the same methods in the USA to brainwash our nation. C&#39;mon America, vote Bernie and become the country we&#39;ve all loved and respected again.&quot;It&#39;s legal because they make the laws.&quot; <br />Says it all...Nice job RoganGood shit, joe! Now have Sam Seder on plz<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=43m54s">43:54</a> Bernie misgendering.... Campaign overTrump 2020 easyyyy win. Make Democrats cry again hahahahahahahahFEELING THE 🔥 IN STOCKHOLM, SWEDENHealthcare is an entitlement, not a human right. This guys is such an irresponsible tool bag.Bernie sounds like a humble dude, like he is open minded and willing to adapt.I’ve read many comments here tonight! And they all mean nothing! What really matter is that Bernie sanders in right! And should be the new president of 🇺🇸 period!Joe Rogan, worst alt right influencer everTrump supporter here. Gotta give Bernie some credit for having the balls to sit down at an interview like this. Most politicians wouldn’t ever do this.You can dress it up as pretty and nicely as you want, but socialism still is the least effective way to bring people out of poverty...About 6,000 people disliked this video based on the guests name only.Imagine this guy trying to deal with  China? He couldn&#39;t even stop a bunch of crybabies from kicking him off his own Podium. But hey atleast he&#39;s going to make people who didn&#39;t go to college pay for the people who voluntarily took out outrageous student loans. So not only will they out compete non-college graduates in the job market, those pesky blue collar workers can subsidize their degrees too!I like turtlesI would totally vote Democrat if they&#39;d lay off guns. I am probably 75% Democrat but they ALL call for gun control. I&#39;m forced to vote for Trump for now.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23feelthebern">#feelthebern</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>Please vote for this guy Americans or someone similar, do yourselves a favourBernie&quot;white people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot;Sanders!What would you do with an extra $1000 a month?<br />YangGang2020Can&#39;t be trusted<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m39s">1:04:39</a><br /><br />Ah yes, WWII.  I remember the documentaries about our battles with China.  <br /><br />Motherfucker is so old that he should have first hand experience.in this episode of JRE, bernie explains why i drinkCrazy bernie hahahaha dude is mentally insane like his supportersI love the old comic where the guy is at a climate change convention and he says &quot;what if it&#39;s all a hoax and WE MAKE A BETTER WORLD FOR NOTHING!&quot;.  If we&#39;re all wrong, we still end up with a net positive for society.Wow i am impressed Joe got Bernie onI love Bernie, but military replicas are not assault weapons. They are not automatic and are not available with armor piercing rounds(typically.) Gun control talk will deliver the election to Trump. Ideas are deadly. Trump has emboldened domestic terrorists who want to foment a race war.Why would you ever wanna put more money power and control into the hands of those who pay no accountability for their actions..ie governmentOne of the biggest scum bags on the planet.  Filthy communist who wants to get rid of your property rights and enslave you within a command control economy.Joe I wish to Hell you were reading these comments, and I really wish you could get Maxine bernier on your show. Shaking up Canadian politics in an era of the cry baby generation.Andrew Yang will destroy him!Why would you dislike this....Because you don’t like him!?? Really.Loved it!!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23GetTrumpsAssOnJoeRogan">#GetTrumpsAssOnJoeRogan</a>Hey Bernie. In the UK here. The politicians get uninterrupted time on the BBC. Which is funded by a tax, called the license fee... which regular people pay just for the basic right to watch live frickin&#39; television in their homes.<br /><br />It&#39;s not a way of doing things Americans would enjoy. And I&#39;m with them. The license fee shouldn&#39;t exist. Especially not to fund an overtly biased corporation like the damned BBC. If the BBC wasn&#39;t funded by license payers, and it was forced to become commercial television -- it would be Britain&#39;s CNN.<br /><br />Bleh.Love it pulling Bernie into deeper waters....Love you Bernie!Dude you had bernie the commie sanders on the show ? LameJust wanted to throw out that high school used to be a luxury until relatively recently. <br />Now it&#39;s a necessity.<br />Why would the same thing not happen to college, especially if everyone has free access to it. <br />If it&#39;s free more people will go to college.<br />Which would mean more people with college degrees.<br />The whole reason you continue to get higher degrees would be to differentiate yourself from other potential employees.<br />You are more knowledgeable and have more education, thus would be the better employee. <br />But if everyone had that, you would be the same as everyone else.<br />So wouldn&#39;t that just make it to where people would have go to even further education before they could stand out?How bout this, make Bernie or Booker vice president. Other than that Trump for president, just cause he&#39;s kept his promises as much as he can. But Joe, I hope you get president Trump on your stuff. And make it 3hours. LolAll candidates should have a conversation with Joe Rogan.<br /><br />Bernie/Tulsi 2020Joe should&#39;ve lit a joint and asked Bernie if he&#39;d like to partake in a legal passtime!Maybe the government and the leaders of this country should start listening to the American people. I feel as though I have NO say what happens in this country, no way to get it out, no wat to communicate, Just like a million &amp; 1 other people in this country!why aren&#39;t they doing dmtB E R N I E !!!Wtf is joe talking about kamala not getting enough time to respond to tulsi? Jake tapper didnt interrupt her once and she had her chance to answer and she CHOSE not to because she knows she did all of those things and had no response. She didnt address a single one of tulsi gabbards points about her record and said she was proud of her work. She basically admitted to what tulsi said and then smeared her by saying she was an assad apologist behind her back. Why would joe say some stupid shit like thatPLEASE GOD IF YOU EXIST, LET SOMETHING GOOD HAPPEN IN AMERICAN POLITICS FOR ONCE 😭😭😭Bernie and Alex Jones together.. now that would be a good show.only one hour long? looks like bernie and joe didn&#39;t get along. probably should have talked more about drugs bern.This man needs to be our president period!All of these comments saying its amazing that Bernie is on Joe&#39;s podcast have not heard the cost of his leftist pandering. iTS 280 BILLION DOLLARS WITH A B!!! That&#39;s fucking crazy and I&#39;m sure he will offer more free shit to get votes just like all the other candidates. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fuckbernie">#fuckbernie</a>Hopefully people will actually listen to him a bit more now than all the smears about him. Bernie is a really good guy trying to good by the American people, genuinely.cornel west and bernie sanders within a week&#39;s time frame??? woke joseph is back at itSimple Google search - <br />Medicare spending grew 4.2% to $705.9 billion in 2017, or 20 percent of total NHE. Medicaid spending grew 2.9% to $581.9 billion in 2017, or 17 percent of total NHE. Private health insurance spending grew 4.2% to $1,183.9 billion in 2017, or 34 percent of total NHE. So that is a total US healthcare cost of  $2471.7 Billion ($2.47 Trillion).  <br />TAX Revenues in 2017: An Infographic. Revenues received by the federal government in 2017 totaled $3.3 trillion, of which $1.6 trillion was receipts of individual income taxes. In 2018 it was $1.7 trillion. <br />Do the math!  That would require the government allot over 2/3 of revenue just for medical...then he want free education and forgiving $1 Trillion in student debt....Why did you softball this intervue?!?!I just finished watching and I just have to ask,  is Uncle Bernie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>?Snore fest. Literally the same talking points over and over again. Also, stop calling them “assault weapons” when they aren’t. I can build a kit car to look like a Ferrari, but it won’t functionally be a Ferrari. The fact that Joe lets him spew this shit is annoying.FEEL THE BERN COCKSUCKAS!Good now do Alex Jones next Bernie !Living in Norway where healthcare is free, education does not put a lot of debt on your shoulders and where we have strict gun control. Seeing so many comments disagreeing with this man kinda gives me the impression that you guys over there are still living in the dark ages.He makes eye contact %10 of the time.<br />Hes a Beta , too weak. MAGAHere before 1 million!Joe beat the shit out of Bernie after the show for shouting at himHealthcare should NEVER be a for profit industry. Never.This guy&#39;s been in DC for 30 years and blaming everybody else except himselfHow about a Gabbard/Sanders ticket?YayJoe Biden will be on episode 30330Ideas sound great on the surface. He isnt talking about how all this will be done. Trillions of dollars that will come from OUR WALLETS.Ask a real fing question JoeI love how people complain that corporations get tax breaks like Amazon. Never contemplating the fact that Amazon pays 575000 employees that are all paying into state and federal income taxes. That is why they get a break. Sure raise their taxes. And they will have to have massive layoffs and move their business overseas and less money will be rolling in to the federal government and watch our deficit continue to grow. Sounds like great talking points but it&#39;s economically crippling.I’m not a Tulsi hater or anything, but I’ve seen so many “Tulsi does this too” comments/replies on this video.Powerful Bernie SandersI&#39;m a pretty right leaning guy but I respect tf out of Bernie and Joe for this. Helps me see the unaltered perspective of one of the bigger candidates, whether or not it changes my mind 🤷‍♂️Joe Rogan for president. I trust him to the fullest&quot;But what about defense of a tyrannical government!?&quot; ...yeah the government that has Predator drones and half the nation&#39;s budget in a military. Thank you Mr. Rogan! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23vetsforbernie">#vetsforbernie</a>Sorry old fart you won&#39;t winlol @ aliensBernie lied about gun shows, you always have to get a background check period.<br />the united kingdom took the guns, and now they have a massive spike in knife attacks/murders.Ellie Goulding:<br /><br />And we gonna let it Bern Bern Bern...Joe is awesome but he&#39;s not the man to ask the tough questions and really dissect what&#39;s being saidI&#39;m sorry but after he got screwed over and rolled like he did in 2016 I do not have any faith in this manJust a no good commie.Socialistic communist. I just spent the last hour yelling at the screen. Oh yeah let&#39;s just change the whole system that has gotten us to where we are! Through two world wars, took us to space, and now currently  the best economy we have ever had.Cornel West, now Bernie! Two of my favorite people.Empty rhetoric on drug the decriminalization question.The smell of pussy is too strong...  Sry Joe I failed you  😭He keeps saying in other countries they do this they do that... this is America fuckin move!!!! We are the most powerful country in the world there is a reason why.. we set our rules!!!!Please get Burnie and Cruz in a room together.What!!!!!! You got Bernie on the show?! Bout time!Bernie Sanders: the President that America really doesn’t deserve.I hope joe touches on both sides of the compass and not just one when he chooses guests to invite<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m09s">2:09</a> Bernie could easily release a video online, outlining the full extent of his plan and insights, and could even afford buying airtime himself. He has no excuse for subpar debate performance. <br /><br />Canada&#39;s healthcare system is becoming increasingly unsustainable for many people, and we, along with the rest of the western world, are nowhere near the world leading medical innovation history the U.S.A boasts. I also don&#39;t want to be subsidizing things like someone&#39;s abortion, and prEP and HPV vaccination for special risk groups, particularly for men who partake in homosexuality, so that inordinately disease prone lifestyles can receive inordinate taxpayer funding, all while broadening the very sad and very real public health concern therein. <br /><br />This of course is all very far removed from the great ideal of personal liberty, which is what I think Mr. Sanders outright neglects to understand.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/63-000-canadians-left-the-country-for-medical-treatment-last-year-fraser-institute-1.3486635">www.ctvnews.ca/health/63-000-canadians-left-the-country-for-medical-treatment-last-year-fraser-institute-1.3486635</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gracemarieturner/2012/05/23/though-the-u-s-is-healthcares-world-leader-its-innovative-culture-is-threatened/#40d1f77c77eb">www.forbes.com/sites/gracemarieturner/2012/05/23/though-the-u-s-is-healthcares-world-leader-its-innovative-culture-is-threatened/#40d1f77c77eb</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.get-prep.com/prep-insurance/trillium-ohip-ohipplus-odb">www.get-prep.com/prep-insurance/trillium-ohip-ohipplus-odb</a>A new paper published by researchers form the University of Turku in Finland suggests that even though observed changes in the climate are real, the effects of human activity on these changes are insignificant. The team suggests that the idea of man made climate change is a mere miscalculation or skewing the formulas by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00165.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00165.pdf</a><br /><br /><br />There you go Bernie. Real science, by real scientists. Stop pushing the human caused climate change hoax. Solar and wind energy technology are garbage and the companies who produce them just want to make a profit so they lobby politicians to sprout this nonsense. If you want clean energy you need fusion reactors or thorium-based nuclear energy.Black people kill 13.6 people a day according to FBI Table 43. <br /><br />Not one candidate is talking about this epidemic. SMH. Racist.I have a feeling Joe Rogan is just trying to get Trump on.Bernie Sanders!!!except in Canada....  you&#39;re far more likely to die before you get that free heart surgery.   TRUMP 2020He doesn&#39;t want to take YOUR money! He wants to take the money away from those evil corporations that hire you! What bad could possibly happen when you overly tax individuals who generate wealth for the economy!? WHAT COULD HAPPEN!? It&#39;s so cute. People have done the math on his policies and what he wants to tax rich people and how much money that would actually generate and EVERY time it never even covers a fraction of the nonsense he wants. But fuck math, am I right!?Tulsi &gt; Berniecommunism is one hell of a drug!That was friggin&#39; Brilliant! Can you imagine if he had Cheeto Benito on for an hour long Q&amp;A on these topics?? He would of made a complete baffoon of himself.Why didn’t joe ask Bernie if he’s done DMT ?Thanks for having him on Joe! Now get all of the others.. I&#39;d love for you to grill Trump tooClearly lots of people just didnt listen to what he had to say.One of these people that think everything is better in europeBernie is dropping knowledge. I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would dislike this man. There may be a better person for the job of President, i get it. But goddamn he is a decent man, who wants to change malevolent mechanisms that most people are completely blind toClimate change is real we need to move away from fossil fuels ASAPBernie will save our society if we put him in office and do our part to help.Youtube Andrew Yang: It&#39;s time to go if you want to hear the most powerful messge:)Youtube Andrew Yang: It&#39;s time to go if you want to hear the most powerful messge:)Do corporations pay taxes or do human beings pay taxes?I really want the government to fix my transmission. Cars are universal right bitchesBiggest hypocrite of all lol<br />Multiple houses sportcars <br />Preach water and bread, drink wine eh?<br />Riding first class everywhere?<br />15 minimum wage? Had to close the whole campaign down lmao<br />This muppet is the epitome of what is wrong with politicsMore politicians should talk directly to the people like this, no media spin, just honest talk, i respect Sanders for doing this.  This is coming from somebody that vehemently opposes Sanders and the lefts current brand of Socialism.This guy sits around complaining about mega corps and billionaires and drug companies and insurance companies controlling our society while pitching a political revolution that will control society.  Bernie knows what is best for me... tell me Bernie.  Stick to MMA and ancient aliens, Joe. Love ya! MAGADamn i wish this was longer, bernie probably has a busy schedule thoCandidates need to STOP preaching college so much. Need to preach more about trade schools and skilled work force. Trades will be  facing a massive labor shortage in the coming years. Requirements to enter a trade apprenticeship program- GED/Highschool diploma and dont be a felon. Get paid to go to school.WE CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!fucking awesome that you had grandpa bernie on, wish it was longer though!I was a little bit disappointed at how politiciany Bernie sounded here. I was hoping he’d mellow out a little on a show of this nature. Further proof Joe has sold out? 🤔I like Bernie, but I didn&#39;t hear any actual solutions coming from him. Yang seems to be way more clear and solution capable.Look here Martha! There&#39;s Joey Rogan just a&#39;changin the world...bit by bit. A natural born world shaker!Only hope for America and thereby the planet is for this man to be elected.I’m not even going to read the comments this time I just want to say that I do you like Bernie Sanders and I don’t actually care that makes me whatever you call it makes meIf you raise minimum wage.....doesn&#39;t the skill trade go up?20 likes and I’ll gas the socialistsI hate Bernie, but glad he did the show. Did give him respect for that. With that said,  short form Bernie is screaming about million/billionaires with no real points. Long form JRE Bernie is screaming about million/billionaires with no real points....I sat in the emergency room with a nail through my hand from a nail gun for 7 hours before they finally saw me.

In the UK even right wing Conservatives agree with most of what he says. Are Americans so dumb to think what he wants is communist?Yes, political parties get free time on TV and free billboard space in Europe, or at least in Germany and The Netherlands. One way to reduce the influence of Big Money on politics.<br />The private money corporations invest in politicians are paid back from tax money 1000 times. It pays to invest public money to keep private money out.The hurdle is the POWER OF MONEY!!!!....Not a fan but GOTDAMN  if he&#39;s not correct....The middle class is fighting some stupid, left/right bullshit, while we&#39;re getting jacked for most of OUR hard MADE money....Fuck the right...Fuck the left....Lets represent the middle/center....US!!!!...the back bone class.Bernie, science is not decided by a poopular vote. In fact, 30,000+ climate scientists have signed a letter proclaiming global warming to be a hoax.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.petitionproject.org/">http://www.petitionproject.org/</a>interestingly enough he made a great point about the opiod epidemic in rural areas, its sickening and kinda a mirror image of what has happened and is still happening to the native american community on the reservations, despair turns into alcoholism and drug use and eventually suicide.We need to do what is right. And not ignore the ugly.think about how dope that would be if JR the moderator and he was sitting around smoking with all of the candidates...I just quit my job at McDonald’s. Was making 13.75 in New York but had to pay daycare more than I made to even be able to attend work. Thank god my girlfriend is a RN or we would be screwed. Time to go college and restart . 🛸This is one of those talks I caught my self saying bullshit out loud enough my co-workers had to stop and ask what I&#39;m listening to. The amount of times Joe didn&#39;t challenge him on what were basic, vague bullshit answers was beyond frustrating.The ice is NOT MELTING you dink!Face it america, your plutocratic system is broken and self destructive and yall too caught up in thinking you&#39;re freer than everyone else to catch up to the places that actually practice democracy.100s of mass shootings a year joe? Stop it you know better than thatIt wouldn&#39;t matter how much time Kamala Harris had.  She couldn&#39;t answer the accusations even in the post interview.Bernie: &quot;we can&#39;t just tell big corporations that they can&#39;t get away with having it all. They won&#39;t listen.&quot;<br /><br />Also Bernie: &quot; you know we told Amazon to raise their minimum wage and they did it.&quot;Bernie has a zero percent chance of winning the presidency. <br />Although his understanding of Canadian vs American health care was pretty on point.You’re looking at the next POTUSYAS THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!The main point to any &quot;debate&quot; is sound bites!<br /><br />Good interview Mr. Rogan! Gave many a, better, platform for discussion!How does throwing people in jail for drugs help decrease their dispair?College costs have soared because the colleges are profit factories that dont care about anything but money in all reality....and he has NO IDEA what an assault weapon is. NO CIVILIAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO BUY THEM IN 33 YEARS except specifically licensed peopleThis should be shared with every american.Any Doctor you want in Canada not trueFinally representing leftist intellectuals; Bernie Sanders is extraordinarily enlightened and insightful. Joe Rogan attempting to rectify the fallacious narrative of leftist political ideology as untenable, idealistic, and ignorant is extremely revitalizing.&quot;...the test of a civilization is the way that it cares for its helpless members&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br />Keep that in mind when you&#39;re trying to &quot;make America great again&quot;I&#39;m broke as fuck, I love free shit, I&#39;m eligible for government assistance but I don&#39;t take it. Food stamps alone would go a long way but I&#39;m not starving so I don&#39;t apply. I do have an Obama phone. I had to buy the phone myself tho. I just get free service. This winter fucked me good. Went from paying my rent on time to paying 2 weeks late to paying at the end of the month, to the beginning of the next month. Missed half a month in March which I still owe and I&#39;m unfortunately behind a couple months. August is due and I&#39;m about to pay June.....I&#39;m not asking for help or pity. Just making a point I&#39;m not asking for help, I work Ali don&#39;t spend on dumb shit and I still struggle. I do not want socialist systems in place. It doesn&#39;t do anyone any good. I could have went to college and got a degree and a job that pays 50,000 plus a year. But because of choices I made I didn&#39;t. Why should hardworking Americans pay my way? Why should i take something that someone else worked hard for? It isn&#39;t fair.<br /><br />Oh I am on Medicaid. So...I do mooch a little.WTF! CrazyNo fucking wayYes Joe the corporation&#39;s goal is to pollute our water and air. That&#39;s the goal lol Bernie is a maniac. You got to see the BS written all over his face and the wallGlobal warming 12 years he&#39;s just going to reroute all the jobs blah blah I&#39;m not buying it. Their not utopian ideas well maybe it&#39;s utopian .and when we where at war with China in WW2 it&#39;s Japan man. By the way it&#39;s our guns that kept them out ,our (civilian guns) Burnie not the army.&quot;Drug companies can charge you anything they want&quot;<br />So can food companies... The difference is if you want to sell milk, you don&#39;t have to bribe the FDA for a billion dollars like drug companies do. The statism Bernie is advocating is why drugs are expensive in the first place. More of what caused the problem is never the solution. Eliminate the FDA if you are sincere about inexpensive drugs. His excuse of price fixing can&#39;t happen in a free market as anyone can enter a market at any time to take advantage of artificially high prices.Anyone who voted for the the most recent military budget increase is way outside the mainstream. We the people are sick and tired of the congressional military industrial complex.Finally someone has made it clear that corporations make the laws. We’re slaves to debt&quot;They make the laws, I just vote them in&quot; SandersFEELING THE 🔥 IN STOCKHOLM SWEDEN!<br />BERNIE SANDERS 2020<br />NotMeUs!Yang&#39;s message is so powerful! @Yang&#39;s message is so powerful! @Yang&#39;s message is so powerful! @Fixing higher education isn&#39;t about giving out low interests loans, or make it free, have the government pay for it. It&#39;s about controlling tuition increase. It&#39;s ridiculous tuition and rate of increase is this high. Cut the tuition by half, the student loan crisis won&#39;t exist.I wish the US would let the international community vote for their president, mr sanders would be in office in a heart beat.The millionaire socialist Bernie Sanders who got setup to lose by the DNC and never said a word about it. He&#39;s a fraud .Rogan you leftist fucking sellout. This retarded old socialist is a complete fucking jokeCommie twat!!A life time in government and has accomplished nothing, other than enriching himself.He would kill our economy. Dont get blindsided by his beautiful foreheaddoes Bernie even matter when he&#39;s claiming the president is a racist and xenophobic and all the other idiotic &quot;democratic&quot; talking points? Dudes followers and campaign workers complained about getting a 36000 salary for being unqualified  campaign helpers. Thats what happens when your followers think they should get an intern job that deserves to have them set for life while they do it. They don&#39;t understand how to work harder for a better future they think just  because they want it they deserve it. Thats why they complained about the salary they agreed with, they will Never have enough and dont even understand the nature of a salary. This guy got screwed by <br />&quot;liberal&quot;  news stations for similar reasons as trump and he still defends them, hes sackless. His problem with the DNC debates is that there are too many candidates with a finite amount of time... guess what, same thing happens with more socialist programs and a finite amount of cashflow.... Gotta spread it then, and all you get is a bit of everything with less quality. Not to mention so many politicians would never work with him nor companies to get it to work.Bernie can&#39;t give any eye contact to Joe. Very interestingI like Bernies platform. Americans are treated as a commodity by corporations. It&#39;s time consumerism gives back to the consumer.1776 will commence againgo joe!Sanders repeatedly said that last year the top 10 pharma&#39;s profit was $69 billion dollars. Our spend in 1 year is $3.5 trillion. Lets say we confiscate all the profit and give it back to the consumers. Congrats, everyone just got a 2.0% discount.Woah. Didn&#39;t see this comingJoe&#39;s got a socialist on the show. Reached a new low. SmhSenator Sanders has made a great point over and over again that healthcare should be a fundamental right as it is in many other countries.  I&#39;ve never understood why he hasn&#39;t pointed out it used to be that way in this country same as education and higher and besides it being easily argued it&#39;s inhumane to deny medical attention/healthcare to someone the very preamble to the US Constitution obligates the government to provide not only for the general welfare of the people but also to ensure their domestic tranquility. You can&#39;t do that if you leave healthcare and education in the hands of profittersthe truth is bernie is a angry old man who has nothing better to do than lecture others on what they should do while not doing that himself and is full of shit and blatantly lies we are not the only country to not gurantee health care as a human rightYES!!! IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!!!!He said the DNC wants to give everyone a fair shot lol3 vacation houses and a 800k main house.  :thinkingemoji:I love the comments about Bernie sounding so rational, calm and logical. He knows how to play an audience and none of his math adds up. Pure and simple.Though I applaud Bernie for coming on Joe&#39;s show... he has no idea what he is talking about.Comrade!!!!A semiautomatic rifle is as much an &quot;assault weapon&quot; as a squirrel would be if I hit you with itDafuq is this shit???Nothing like listening to Bernie Sanders talk about politics while filling out the ballot for your city ordinance.Fuckin&#39; commie scum bag. Tell Bernie to go eat his pudding in a gulag.Bernie2020, Redefining greatness for the working people, God bless him&quot;We need medicare for all so people can get the mental healthcare when they need it.&quot; Doesnt the govt run the VA? Hows that working out.Profound. This will be looked on in history. This will be refered to in the years to come.<br /><br />The day a politician stepped up<br /><br />The day a leader had the time and platform to speak his truth<br /><br />The day bernie sanders was asked about dmtWhat a difference it makes when theres no buzzwords and virtue signaling.I have no idea what is fair, but I invest in the pharma companies, so I want them to be profitable.Joe you should have some presidential debate shows!Didn&#39;t have a legit answer for $15 minimum wage. <br /><br />Answer is, don&#39;t artificially raise things like this. Dear Lord, you can&#39;t even run your own campaign (aka his business) and you expect to run the country. <br /><br />Jog on matei make 23 an hour doing a skilled trade, and if they rase minmum wage, they wont raise my pay..... so that will make skilled trades a dying feild, took out 3 lones, to pay for college, and payed them off in 2 years,,,, you dont need rich family, or free shit, spend your money wisly, and look for a job, befor you enrole in college, so you know where and what you will be able to do....Yes!!!! My man !! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>Respect to Bernie! But my biggest takeaway is that the assumption that the President is the most power person in the world is a joke and fake news! The most powerful people are big corporations and pharmaceutical companies! So basically he can’t do nothing as President to make any changes!Preach Bernie!Sorry Bernie, you&#39;re wrong about the minimum wage. Stop wasting taxpayer dollars to hire more social workers because 10% of American households are on food stamps, when minimum wage helps the fewest people and does nothing to help those @$15/hr right now who are also struggling.<br /><br />And you say businesses can compete with each other fairly because it applies to all of them, but you&#39;re not taking into account that the giant mega-corporations you rail against are the ones that can afford it, while small businesses and entrepreneurs are shut out of the markets.<br /><br />What if I told you there&#39;s a better alternative? <a href="http://yang2020.com/">Yang2020.com</a>remember to buy uncle bernies book and keep contributin&#39; to that campaign fund after sitting on that apple, and dont tell no one he told you to take yer undewares offI live in Canada and know several people who have gone to Mexico for surgery because the wait list here is eternal.I&#39;m on thyroid medication and I pay $5.01 for 200 tablets in Australia. I&#39;m guessing in the US that would look more like $501 And that&#39;s fucked up.I&#39;m not a trump supporter. I dont like any party. Who gives a fuck about how my great grandkids live. Fuck em. Let them figure it out.Thought this video was a troll before I clicked.TRUMP 2020You didn’t get my vote old man, but you did get some of my respect.Bernie complaining about the media is adorableLook I like the guy but he is too far left on every single issue. Just come a bit closer to the middle and I&#39;m on board, your paying for to much,  treat mental health not take my guns.Remember when we thought Kanye would be the biggest JRE podcast this year?later on Andrew yang on the H3H3 podcast.Fuck Bernie Sanders and Fuck Joe Rogan.Thanks for having Bernie on, Joe! Can&#39;t wait to vote for this guyJoe and Bernie did DMT after this podcast and Bernie found how to win the 2020 elections.... I’m calling itRogan has eddie bravo on to talk about flat earth and conspiracy theories for 3+ hours, but can&#39;t talk to a presidential candidate for more than 1 hour smhi lost respect for bernie when he sold-out to hilary clinton back in 2016very disappointed we didn&#39;t see Bernie spark one up in this podcastI can smell the bullshit through the screen.Hello all,   I&#39;m a kiwi from New Zealand an the shooting of those people here was disgusting an yes we have come down hard on gun owner&#39;s an i think that&#39;s fair.<br />We are still able to own firer arms but our licencing is going to get a lot harder an that&#39;s the right thing to do to protect everyone.<br /><br />Look I like Bernie as he is trying to get my counterparts in the US the same human rights I have here in New Zealand as we get free schooling , free medic care , an so on like if we do have to pay any fee for schooling it&#39;s a school fee which is around $150 per year. But we to have the same problem with higher education as we do have to pay for that schooling.<br />Like I&#39;ve had to have two lower back surgery&#39;s which cost around $35,000 to $45,000 NZD for each which I paid $0 to get because of our accident compensation corporation which is government owned an run. Now without them I would have a $70,000 to $90,000 Debt but since ACC took care of that we can just get on with recovering an ACC charges every motor vehicle owner a ACC fee an employers are charged a fee for each employee this is all once a year.<br /><br /><br />Now on the climate change Joe people just have to open there eye on my side of the world an see that climate change is real <br /><br />I&#39;ll finish by saying if a little country like New Zealand can offer free health care there is no reason my Counterparts in the US can&#39;t get this as well but you will have to fight hard to get it from everything i have reed over the last year of two.   If you stand by Bernie&#39;s side I feel he will get your health care an the other thing&#39;s but you have to be willing to get the 1% to hear all your voices.<br />With love &amp; Respect from a little kiwiNot a Bernie fan. But good for him for putting himself out there.For minimum wage why wouldn&#39;t you implement a system like the UK where you have a minimum wage for age categoriesWow he was pretty reasonable <br />I’m still voting trump tho 💁🏻‍♂️Very by the books interview, nothing new we hadnt heard before. Good on Joe for being fair. Bernie has a big heart but promises everything under the sun.  Glad this happened, glad bernie has a platform but hope people arent so naive to fall for this pitch.Love the diversity Joe.... but it seems like you let the politicians off easy. You dont bring the same skeptical push back that you do with all other guest.This guy is a liar, a fraud, and worse still, a communist. Everyone can be equally poor.Should Tulsi Gabbard and Bernie Sanders run on the same ticket? <br />Tulsi for president and Bernie as her Vice President...who would endorse???The way Bernie talks in a quiet voice reminds me of Joey Diaz lmaoBernie: Health Care is a human right.<br /><br />The right: Taxation is theft.<br /><br />Its upsetting that this is modern debate from the market of idea&#39;s group.Trump will never come on any show or podcast because he doesn&#39;t need to. Not even an optionJoe didn’t tell Bernie to move the microphone a fist from his face. He moved it for him. Pecking order.This is the part where Joe Rogan&#39;s fanbase fights for billionaires like George Soros and the Koch&#39;s to reign over them like King&#39;s because somehow taxing them at a higher percentage than the middle class is Socialism.I liked my own comment for a good reason!lol, the dislikesStop saying solar is a fucking viable optionFuckin communistAny question joe asks Bernie ignores and talks about his agenda sounding nice but not answering the question.Unfuckingreal bro omg!!!Everything he said sounds sensible. If I talked to some of my friends about this man you would&#39;ve thought the Antichrist revealed himself.Why would you have this clown on your show?Ughhhh get ARNOLD Schwarzenegger on the show!! Besides Elon, and Peterson Arnie is one id like to see you Interview!!! Come on Joe!!Would be hilarious if Trump came on next.Abolish the Federal Reserve, go back to a gold/silver standard. <br />There is no reason for Americans to be getting the value of their currency from a private entity. As a matter of fact, EVERY country should do this.I hope bernie wins, it will expedite the downfall of the U.S., then we can finally hit the reset button once and for all.Still wont see me vote communistif the democrats don&#39;t give bernie a shot they&#39;re fucking idiotsKeep promising to give away other people&#39;s money Bernie!Fuck bernieBernie just side stepped the question &quot;how do we curb the cartels, selling drugs illegally rather than legalization and regulation?&quot; 🙃Thanks joeSay bye bye to business and factories!Bernie &quot;Attack the producers, ignore the banksters&quot; SandersHey America can you vote this guy in next time please? Cheers! xx The rest of the world.lmao. Only an hour? Guess he needed the nap and pudding?Feel the Bern!!Bernie for president! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23letsseethemaliens">#letsseethemaliens</a>Bernie on Joe Rogan. This is a YUGE step for Bernie’s message and Joe’s show.Hold on I thought Joe Rogan was part of the racist group called &quot;Intellectual Dark Web&quot; didn&#39;t we hate him like, 5 min ago? I&#39;m confused.five minutes in and joe hasnt asked him how he justifies having multiple vacation houses and what his wife did to a small college and still call himself a socialistLess then 200 people turned in their guns in NZ.Holy fucking shit about timeAlso, while he isn&#39;t my favorite Democrat candidate right now, I do respect him. He seems like a genuinely nice guy with a lot of passion. He&#39;s been fighting for everything he&#39;s fought for for as long as anyone can remember. I don&#39;t know many people with that kind of consistency.I wanted Bernie sanders to win back in 2016! I’m a Canadian and it’s unbelievable that this man didn’t win! He’s the game changer, guaranteed. If he doesn’t win on the next election! I’ll say America is a corrupt pile of shit and wish all peoples to come to Canada 🇨🇦CNN is a fraud and it’s disgusting to see them frame questions in a far right way and smear progressivesThanks Joe and Bernie!  This is so-o-o much better than circus of TV debates.Why only 1 hr?I like Bernie, I like the way he talks, but when it comes to a vote, I&#39;m am a single issue voter and him banning guns is my vote for someone else.I fucken love this beautiful man. Bernie 2020 👴🇺🇸👓❤Bernie all the way!It’s clear to me that this man wants the best for this country. He’s genuinely exposing and fighting the real issues despite the possible consequencesGet trump on nowwwwwwwYou have a hugely popular platform here joe. I hope you do the fair thing and invite the president to speak on your podcast. If he declines that’s on him but I think he should equally be heard.I’m not even 3 minute in, nor am I a Bernie fan, but I’m really happy for Joe Rogan. He’s getting big names on this podcast and if he keeps it up he is going to spear head a complete revolution over how we go about getting out serious news/discussionsOh crazy Bernie... Explaining issues without providing real solutions yet again &amp; again.<br />Seriously... What the heck is this load of s*** Joe??? <br />This interview is a load of bs. Probably bought &amp; payed for too.<br /><br /><br />Joe: What&#39;s your solution?<br />Bernie: 50 years ago, this and that. Now it&#39;s this and that... It as to change.<br /><br />Really... WTF??? He ain&#39;t saying s***!!!<br />How can anyone follow this buffoon?<br /><br />This guy would bankrupt any business within a year. Imagine a country.<br />BTW Bernie: Canada&#39;s healthcare crappy system DOES NOT &#39;&#39;cost nothing&#39;&#39; for hearth surgery and such or other... You lying goofball.<br />Go learn basic economics.interview a fucking idiot next time!!!!....one time sin&#39;t enoughGreat to hear Bernie long form, but his ideas are still misguided.I agree with 95% of his plans, make this man the president already!Min wage is 7.25 what?Its like Bernie&#39;s head poped out of his shirt like the OH YEAAHH guy.This is our chance as “ordinary Americans” to stand up to the ourselves. No other candidate is in this fight for us.No healthcare experts will tell you Canadian healthcare is as good or better than America&#39;s!I live in Kentucky, born and raised, and I feel his McConnell statement so hard! That old puppet mouth Mitch &quot;the bitch&quot; McConnell is a gelatinous plop of putrid shit that needs to be removed from his big lifelong political career and have the holy hell snap-slapped out of his flappy gullet repeatedly before promptly being stripped of all his dirty money and deposited in the middle of a rural coal slurry somewhere in east KY and left to fend for himself. I did not, have not, and will not ever vote for that fuckhead and I&#39;m ashamed of my fellow kentuckians that apparently did and have continued to vote the cunt In. And don&#39;t even get me started on our sausage-wallet governor, Bevin and his cum-dumpster old lady...My gawd. <br />You know what? Fuck the whole shebang. I&#39;m over the government in general. In it&#39;s entirety. Buncha scheming, crooked, lying fucksticks that ain&#39;t gonna do shit to help anybody but themselves and they&#39;re all just there for show and entertainment for who the hell ever is REALLY controlling this circus.This may have just won Bernie Sanders presidency..... this is no doubt the biggest platform in history &amp;&amp; he hit the entire hour out the ballpark. Incredible.Bernie shouldn&#39;t be using Canada as any good example of universal healthcare. You cannot have any doctor you want, that is not true. Doctors are placed in their positions by the government. My mother lives in a small town of 5000 and no one in town has a family doctor. Recently on Canada Day, they even had to shut down their emergency room because they didn&#39;t have any doctors to work that day. In my town of Moncton roughly (100k) a woman recently waited 11 hours for a doctor to see her, then she died in the hospital because they didn&#39;t have anyone to see her in time.A lot of half truths and mis leading statements were just told.  I wishJoe would challenge Bernie a little more on some of the more obvious ones.  Joe definitely is more aggressive and challenging with his conservative guests.It&#39;s clear from this interview, Bernie is getting high on his own supply.  Did they smoke frog secretions before this or what?Okay Joe at first you had my curiosity, but now you have me attention.Why didn&#39;t Joe offer him any DMTBernie 2020!!! Nobody asks how we&#39;re going to pay for these absurd wars or for the tax breaks for the rich and corporations. Bullshit, we want Medicare for all now!So we can get Bernie Sanders on JRE but not Conor Mcgregor? WTF?They actually got Bernie. Joe, you absolute madman. You did it.Get Mitch McConnell on the show. I see his point on many issues but I disagree on the issue of minimum wage and I feel as though he tried to gloss over that a bit.This didn&#39;t even show up in my notifications!!!WHHHHAAAAAAAAAAT!!!!!!!!!!!! The only reason I&#39;d watch a political JRE EVVVVVVEEEEEEERRRRR! Bring back the TYT ARMY Joe.Am I the only one that gets annoyed when lifetime politicians complain about the problems and show they have no real plan on how to solve the problems. Problems aren&#39;t that easily solved in governmentHOLY FUCK! Dude how the hell did you get this man on?!Hell yeah, tomorrows commute is going to be awesome.Bernie, what&#39;s your take on DMT??Just watch the democratic socialist of America just to see what would happen under BernieMedicare for all is rationed healthcare. Talk to Canadians. Six months for an MRI.Mark my words, MOST VIEWED JOE ROGAN PODCAST! Bernie 2020!!!!!What does it make me if I am pro trump but also agree with everything Bernie has said in this podcast??? My heads going to explode this is weird!!!!Joe &quot;Go ahead and pull that sucker in&quot; HoganHes got a lot of great ideas and wants to help... but he has no idea how to actually make it work. Thats the problem. I know how a particle accelerator works but i sure as hell couldnt reset it and restart it. Neither could he do a restart of the country with his lack of knowledge and inability to explain his proposed actionsMy only issue with Bernie is that he&#39;s starting to show some cracks in his ideals, such as not paying his own workers what he advocates for, and even giving them less hours, when their hours wasnt the issue. Not to mention the insane stupidity to say that &quot;white people dont know whats its like to be poor&quot;. He also comes across as extremely weak willed, and easily walked over. I&#39;d take Tulsi or Yang over him anyday now.0.5% fee for buying a stock? that would be a horrible systemI believe Bernie has lost it from being cheated out of 2016, and has gone tooooooooo far left and radical. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23maga2020">#maga2020</a> 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Sounds like a bunch of empty promises with a side of extremely high taxes and the end of our capitalistic society. Not to mention whenever the government gets its hands in anything the quality goes down and the price shoots through the roofI live in Canada, if I break my arm and go to the emergency room and require surgery immediately I pay absolutely nothing. When I go to University and obtain a 4-year bachelors degree, I pay less money in my 4 years of study then Americans do in one semester. The ideas Sanders is fighting for and trying to pass are less radical/socialist then Canada&#39;s policies, and we are doing just fine. This fear-mongering that some how Bernie Sanders is going to turn the country into Venezuela is absolutely ridiculous.Gross Joe.just try and censor Joe corporate Jew overlordsAndrew Yang was betterGive the man some waterBernie will increase the unemployment numbers.  He will have to greatly increase your tax rates.  He is making statement, between the Hillary coughing, with generalized rich people are bad statements.  How are you going to grow the economy?  Create jobs?  Stop jobs from going over seas?  Control immigration?  He wants to open borders.  Do you think a billion would come?  You bet.  We would turn into a third world country overnight.  How will he help lift up the poor?  More money?  The worst cities in the nation are all run by liberals.  Bernie is a communist.  You think he is the answer promising you other peoples money?  Your going to be in long unemployment lines, in food lines. Your not thinking this through because Bernie is a long term politician that has done what?  What has Bernie sponsored while in office?  What are his accomplishments outside writing a book?  A big fat nothing.Ross Perot said a lot more in his 30 min ad.  This guy repeated the same thing he says on national tv with no more substance.The fact that Bernie has been screaming and fighting for this since the 60s just shows how much he believes this to be correct. Most morons that ignore him are just basically numb nuts and band wagon puppets that lack deep thinking. This guy literally screams his lungs out for America to wake up. America is just dumb as fuck. Look who they fell for in the white house. Tulsi and Bernie are the only 2 today can be honest with youHoly shit. I can&#39;t believe you got Bernie Sanders on.Hey remember Columbine? It happened during the “assault weapons ban”US has the highest cost of healthcare, and the highest survival rate of cancer.  What are we willing to pay for and not pay for?Take out ur walletAmerica isn&#39;t set up for Bernie to be Prezi...Ok Fk no Joe Rogan, you did not just use Adderall to make your point about mental health, instead of anyi- depressants, Amazing! Total BS!I never thought I&#39;d see thisJoe PLEASE invite all Canadian candidates.. it would be nice to listen to themNew Zealand does not have a constitution Bernie .Bernie isnt yelling for once.<br /><br /> Glad to see him get a chance to present his views.I’m registering to vote tomorrow. I’m voting for this guy.Americur, Canadur, Chiner, RussierBernie is racist toward corporations.Get Donald Trump on the show he deserves a chance to defend himself&quot;PAY PEOPLE $15/HR! I CAN&#39;T AFFORD TO PAY PEOPLE WORKING ON MY CAMPAIGN $15/HR!&quot;one hour of watching a thumb talk to a communist cant wait to hear from pingtrip and the bears on this oneFUCK I wish Joe had Killer Mike on with Berniei would have listened to 4 hours of thatPlease try and get Donald Trump! That may be close to a Alex jones/ joe Rogan episode!Wow, you had Bernien Sanders on? Lol. Fuck socialism. Nothing is free people.the only person Bernie got out of poverty was Bernie, because of capitalism, when is he going to stop lying to the youth.<br />during the cold war comrade Bernie was in Russia living it up,, this mf is a Russian bot😮 Bernie! Bomaye!Scumbag sellout communist lying Jew bastardbernie your too old and a god dammed traitor.Buahahahahaha 12 years till disaster.  They&#39;ve been saying that for decades.You need to stop using Canada as the golden example of Government controlled healthcare: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2jijuj1ysw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2jijuj1ysw</a>I find it comical when Bernie talks about the 1% when he is in the 1%How can a country claim to be a land of freedom when their people are forced to work their asses off to afford decent medical treatmentWhy Joe why , lost respect JoeAnd liberals have the audacity to call Trump a con man LMAO@The Serf California has been equally fucked by both Parties for a very long time. What hurts Cali more than anything is how it gets basically robbed every year. It is the major engine that drives the entire economy, benefits most of the country with it&#39;s economy and gets practically nothing in return in comparison to what it gives out. That issue is too complex to get into here, but don&#39;t conflate the policies of Dem / Rep representatives with the federal government not giving Cali what it is due. Now yes, there have been representatives of both parties that have made the mess worse but to pin the troubles solely on the Dems is misguided. It is like putting all the blame on migrants for coming to work there and giving the companies that lure them in a free pass for being predatory capitalists while they demean Americans for not wanting those jobs. I tell you what, if they paid the wage commensurate for that labour and gave a healthcare plan that actually benefits the individual those jobs would get filled by Americans. It is the fact that capitalism as it is in America now is a neo slave - master relationship and they fool everyone into thinking it is the only way out of poverty. A cruel joke that only they laugh for.SELLOUT<br />SELLOUT<br />SELLOUT<br />SELLOUT<br />SELLOUTFeel the bern bitches........!!!And I thought Joe Rogan Experience couldn&#39;t get any better.<br />Respect.We must stop the evil <del>millionaires</del> billionairesMigration and Climate change are gonna fuck your campaign  up.All the ult-right Walmart shooting domestic terrorists Donald trump fucks are triggered as fuck right now.Please link the moment Joe talks about DMTDon&#39;t fall into the trap and get carried away by the sweetness of the Radical Left talks. Everything they promote comes with hidden terms and conditions and a horrible price to pay.Don&#39;t like bernie but glad he came onNotice how every time Bernie says &quot;free,&quot; Joe doesn&#39;t call him out on his bullshit.  There is no fucking such thing as free.  What Bernie means, is you pay 70% taxes for the rest of your life for substandard services.Joe... good sh!t man. Get all these yahoos in like this. This was actually great man. I’ve learned so much about Bernie and I think it was good and I think it’s important. If the debates are sh!t then please do what’s right for us ignorant folks like me who want to know, don’t know how to find out, and is open to listening. Appreciate you man! Much love brother. You’re the best!!!Joe Rogan is a fucking republican trump bum LICKER... What the fuck is this....study politics get a degree and fucking talk to me ...because rogan had taken dmt doesn&#39;t make him benevolent of politics he knows fuck all and sounds like an undercover right wing fascist &quot;oooo I talk to famous people look at me&quot; terrible comedian with  Arrogant egotistic rubbish bye!!!!!its real easy ...if you have a job and get a pay check bernie wants an even bigger % wew are talking 65 to 75 % ... good luckJoe Rogan 100% needs to be the one hosting these debates. My suggestion, he has 2 candidates on for and hour and let them discus things without an audienceA transaction tax on Wall St will not work, transaction fees have fallen faster than the price of a ..you name it. Ta unearned income is the solution, capital gains and dividend income. It a no brainer. If you work hard to earn cash, it should be taxed less. The current system allow for income from share price increase and dividend income (dividend income in Canada anyway, is ta much less and earned income). Add tax on luxury items too, like a Yatcht...if you can buy a $40M boat, pay up to help a retiree pay for her meds...he or she may have helped build that boat. Sanders jobs for all is a joke, and the min wage thing is a good debate. Simply tax the stock options and the like.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=7m43s">7:43</a> I can&#39;t take anymore of this guy. Leaving . dont let the view count fool you. I bet moat stop listening within 10 minutes.Yeah, nice guy.  Great ideas.  What in the actual FUCK makes all of you believe that this man is going to change anything?  We all know big pharma is the problem and big oil and big everyone who has the power to lobby congress.  What makes you think that they&#39;re just going to roll over for Bernie?  What makes you think that getting democrats back in control of the senate is going to magically make everyone play fair?  Jesus Christ, didn&#39;t any of you see the clips from the Democratic Socialist Convention that went viral?  I watched the whole thing because it was mind-blowing that it was reality and not parody.  You think those types of people are going to stand down the most powerful, intimidating factions of D.C.?  You think electing this man is going to create instant honesty amongst politicians?  You think some happy &quot;visions&quot; are going to inspire congressman to quit taking bribe money?  You think the &quot;working class&quot; of Americans are going to start using preferred pronouns and pierce their nose and put up Bernie signs after you take their guns away?  Have you all lost your fucking minds?Loved that joe asked about the aliens! Release the files, bernie!Get Marianne Williamson on.To be fair, I have to respect Sanders for appearing on the show. This was a well done talk. I disagree on several policies, but find myself agreeing on others. We need this type of conversation.Health Care in America is a Horrific Cluster FUCK!!Am I the only one that thinks this looks hella scripted? Like they are always looking down and reading. No pan out shots. This does not feel like a pod cast. It is no better than what national TV outlets do. The only difference is that Joe is asking the questions that he is allowed to ask. This is not freedom.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieSanders2020">#BernieSanders2020</a>Any Democrat who puts yang as vice president would be nearly unstoppable.Got a shit load of pharmaceutical ads during this podcast.....He has a lot of facts, but forgot the source/statistics/or where he read the information. HahahahaJudging by the blatant misinformation Bernie is spreading about firearms...I can only imagine what else hes lying about.As someone who is far from a fan of Bernie Sanders, It&#39;s nice to see that he is willing to speak on a platform where it&#39;s much more difficult to hide how you truly feel about political issues. Hasn&#39;t changed the fact that i wouldn&#39;t ever vote for him but at least i know he does actually care to some degree about the issues he&#39;s bringing up.Whether you like Bernie or not (and I like him. A lot. And I hope that he wins,) it&#39;s really cool that this happened and that we get to hear a candidate of his profile really talk about what he believes in to educate voters and dispel a lot of the BS the media puts out there, ranging from CNN to Fox. The debates are hot garbage.No such thing as democratic socialism, l live in Australia what he talking 6 hours waiting in emergency, months waiting to a specialist and the cost to the taxpayer witch that&#39;s where he going to find the moneyThis guy is a hack, just like his socialism propaganda.I dislike Bernie&#39;s politics but props to him for coming onto JRECan we get trump on this mfSanders 2020 and Rogan as VP 😂🤣Joe “Bernie Sanders” RoganGreat conversation with a truly decent human being.Lol Bernie sure skirted that alien question at the endThe problem with Healthcare as a right, is that you then have to decide how much you are going to pay providers. Their labor is not yours and I sure as hell would not put myself through grueling years of school and enormous debt, to work for 60k a year or 70k, or whatever the government decides I should be able to charge for my labor and knowledge. NoAyeeeeeeBlimeyTulsi  gabbard and Andrew yang are the only 2 democrat options I would consider voting for in the &quot;right /left only&quot; pool we have today.Get Noam Chomsky on!People take this life thing too seriously ... get your home life fixed, try to be happy,  then come and give us  your uneducated opinionsAt least Bernie is what he says he is.  You know what you&#39;re getting if you vote for him.  I am NOT  a supporter of his, but I respect that he is willing to have long form conversations and he really has not wavered on his political views.I hate this muthafuck. I&#39;m just glad he&#39;ll never be President.&quot;Did you beat up your wife, have you committed crimes?&quot;  Hey fucktard, the background checks for gun ownership already check for this.What a posAmerica you have this kind of people, and somehow Trump is youre president. Youre country is not the greatest country anymore. Like Bernie said, you have to redifine what being a great country is.<br />And yes im from Denmark :)YEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!We need Don Trump on this show!I want Trump as a guest on JREBernie- free dmt for all.Joe should host the presidential debates.The only way we could actually solve the gun crisis is to ban guns all around not just civilians, which will never happen because the government already has enough power and if they were the only ones allowed to possess fire arms then it would be game over folks.Not a single thing he said about gun control would prevent the latest shootings. And he&#39;s full of shit about the PTSD counseling here in last Vegas. I&#39;m a survivor of that shooting, my wife went to the free counseling, it still exists, that&#39;s just a flat out lie.This is the best interview of BernieWhat is truly sad is that people will spin this conversion to take the spotlight away from what Bernie is saying. Instead, very stupid people will say, &quot;Why the hell is Bernie talking about greed? His house is worth millions of dollars&quot; Just think about the fact that Bernie Sanders to convince people that corporation should pay more than $0 in taxes.politicians always look old after leaving office. Bernie is gonna be quite the fuckin science experiment.Max holloway when!!!I am libertarian. I do not disagree with everything he says. Problem is all these guys say things that simply are false. And spin every statisticKeep in mind they pushed gun regulations through and now they are pushing for more and after that they will push for more until.....the goal of banning guns is a accomplishedPoliticians shouldn t buy tv time...Joe look out that old man with 3 houses and tons of cash is going for your walletHe can’t wait to spend our money.Joe &quot;Try the stuff from here it will do something for ya&quot; RoganMy big worry about his healthcare for all is this<br />Yes Canada you don’t pay a dime when u go doctor but Canada has 37.6 millions people, the USA has 327.2 million now as you can see we have 290 million more people then Canada has , I am now worried that we will have a shitty healthcare system were the doctors won’t be able keep up with all the demand and people will wait years for life threat procedures and Bernie doesn’t admit it but he’s for open borders we all know that so when the whole world floods to us what will we do?Well on education... Here&#39;s the thing, I went to cheap state school for engineering and got a good job after, barley paid anything.  I didn&#39;t pick some bullshit private school because they had cool looking buildings and didn&#39;t get a stupid ass degree. They charge what people will pay. There&#39;s to many stupid people going to the schools and pay high pricesfuck off back to russia ya flithly commieThese comments are absolutely cancerous. Too many triggered conservatives.The amount of people in this comment section who are unaware of the talking points that have captured their speech, and by extension their thought, is quite depressing. <br /><br />Everyone should take some time and read up on framing, rhetoric, and most importantly critical thinking.Come on Joe! Call BS on that &quot;gun show loop hole&quot; lie!Whaaaaat!? This better be good!Still do not be fooled ! <br />Trump 2020Joe asking him if he will tell us if aliens are real is the amazing! 👽👽👽Joe should have got the old geezer high? Than he could realize that TRUMP went in and took over a broken system and put the country back on top of the world number one.... But Sorry Old Man your just wasting your time, TRUMP pulls in a 100,000 tickets to a rally with every ticket sold and 10 to 1 wanting a seat, Bernie you can’t pull in 1,000 people a rally without handing out a free lunch to get them to come to it.. TRUMP is a Machine and all yous put together can’t beat trump, it’s clear the People want trump, he different and Bernie would just put America back 10 years or 15 years, everyone wants to go forward not backwards Bernie... I can’t wait to see these clowns go against TRUMP in a rally or debateWell I got through 30 minutes, Bernie so full of shit.&quot;Aii WILL NOT try DMT Joe&quot;<br /><br />   - Bernie SandersBernie &quot;I spoke to someone last night&quot; SandersIm Pro Trump but Bernie you def earned points today. 👊👍Joe Rogan please Line them all up for us to hear them out. ❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Someone get Peter Schiff on here to school Bernie on minimum wage pleaseWhy people escape with drugs and alcohol, are the same reasons they go on shootings.I think joe could have been a lil tougher on Bernie, but kudos for neutrality.Ok Holy crap Finally he’s here !!!!!!Proud of the comment section for being as civil as we are. I expected worse. We may disagree with people, but that doesn’t mean we have to be assholes.Just stopped to drop my dislike 👌oh shitjoe rogan interviews fossilized jewJoe should get Jeremy Rifkin on the show to talk about climate change, Bernie totally glossed over the fact that China are leading the shift away from fossil fuels along with Russia and most other countries are set to follow. The US is gonna lose out hard in the future unless they saddle up.Thrown out of the hippie comune for being too lazy. That&#39;s commitment.Joe is a socialistJust to be clear, folks... &quot;A tax on Wall Street speculation&quot; means your pension and 401(k) will be paying for it. <br /><br />It means if you&#39;ve worked hard enough to have a broker, or maybe manage your own trades, you&#39;ll be paying for Lesbian Dance majors who will eventually become bloggers who convince people to vote for these candidates who promise YOU will pay more. <br /><br />Don&#39;t do this. Do not feed the stray cat. No matter how bad you feel. Otherwise, you&#39;ll be eating cat food and huffing paint in no time at all.I shat myself when I read the titleJoe Rogan you are doing a favour to society by giving politicians a platform to discuss their matters accuratly and in lengthget this dinosaur outta hereWithin the first 3 minutes he blamed the media, and hinted at fake news.<br />Can tell you right now the coverage that will get, will be zero. <br />Trump could literally walk on water and the headlines would read &#39;Trump can&#39;t swim&#39;.0.05 degrees in temperature change.  Along with all the planets in the solar system.  He’s lying about climate change.Bernie you got my vote, let’s do this shit.Whats up fellow young people?Joe &#39;I&#39;m a regular person&#39; Rogan.5,963,792 will vote for Bernie Sanders because of Joe RoganWhy not just do 21 JRE episodes instead of the clown show that is the Democratic debates?Joe I wished you pushed back on bernie more.BERNIEEEEEE. I FEEL THE BERNNNNNext podcast- president trumpJoe, please please get Anand Giridhardas on the podcastWow, this podcast really showed Bernie&#39;s intelligence on all the issues you asked him about. Not just the stump speech he gives in the debates. I wish deep, thoughtful conversations between candidates were had in the debates like this!If joe wouldn&#39;t change his beliefs based on his guest you could take this more serious. Also the way joe leads bernie to the next question sounds way to scriptedWhat is an &quot;assault weapon&quot;?Bernies got his gunshow facts wrong, cant buy a gun at a gunshow without a background check, surprised Jamies not fact checking himSo the goal of the health care providers is to make a profit on providing those services? No shit Bernie. This guy started right off talking about how things are in other countries. Go move there then ya commieMr Sanders has many great ideas to make our country better. Unfortunately I don’t believe he will win. If anything he has to be careful. We’ve seen this happen in the past (JFK, MLKJr) We as citizens should rally and demand changes. United we are stronger.<br />Joe thanks for this interview.Thank u JoeBernie Sanders - The first guy to keep the mic about a fist away from his face without having to be told. He deserves to be president.Bernie got my vote 🗳Bernie Sanders had the opportunity to discuss his talking points in great detail for 3 plus hours and he chose not to.  He is a master of speaking in vague and non descriptive terms.  It is not difficult for the average person to identify that Bernie Sanders is not all that bright.A hairless ape interviews an old manAny business goal is to make money. We have the best health care in the world also the best medicine. You can&#39;t have cheap healthcare without stealing innovations from America. You make some okay arguments Bernie but you lack a real world view.You lost me at guns. Trump 2020.80 year old communist running for president. What a sick fraud<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m31s">47:31</a><br /><br /><br />CORPORATIONS BUY OUR MARINARA!!!!!!!!!The only show we can find out if Bernie really went nuts or he&#39;s just putting on a show for the left.Stop 5G!!!!!this was dopebro you really got this old geezer on here but not kanye west?Ohh shiiiiit! He got Bernie!hes 4 years too late , tulsi and yang are our underdogs , he showed us that hes really just part of establishmentNo borders! Let me (an Australian) vote in your election, racist fascists!What a moron, a raise in the minimum wage will only benefit those who work for companies with inelastic demands. This means that these firms can assume the increase in cost by increasing proportionally the price of their products which would hurt consumers, specially those who can barely afford what they currently consume (aka working class). The firms with elastic demands will most likely have to lay off workers or shut down unless they are making very high supernormal profits which at a small scale (eg. a single McDonalds restaurant) simply does not happen since companies usually don&#39;t profit maximise as their only objective as it is not the most efficient way to grow in many cases. In the long-run the prices will just adjust to the additional cost which could possibly lead to stagflation (inflation without reducing unemployment - the opposite of the Phillips Curve), a very disastrous economic phenomenom which is extremely hard to rectify. If everyone had this level of economics understanding, no-one would support this useless populist platform of increasing the minimum wage.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23womenandcucksforbernie2020">#womenandcucksforbernie2020</a>Get Trump on the podcast!  lolGreat talk! Bernie has a great mindset towards the topics discussed, just some holes in the ideas... but i&#39;m sure with a proper team those things can be sorted out, he would get my vote if I was American.Shoutout from Windsor, Ontario!!So many comments that pay respect to a socialist politician who wants to steal your money.  You guys are outta your mindsSorry Bernie, if illegal immigrants are covered by this, its never going to work and never happening. A right of every citizen maybe but its not our responsibility to provide South and Central America healthcare.4,500 individuals who like to vote against their interests.I am voting for this man. He is our saviorBernie tellin it how it is, meanwhile over 4k ppl prove his point of how much effort their is to discredit him and just downvote without watching.nah, F forgiving student loans. Half these kids are from well off families merely financing instead of paying cash, and the other half are idiots who didn&#39;t consider the trade-offs. Even if you put an income cap, rich kids will just legally separate from their parents but go work for the family business or some entry-level gig for a short while. For those that chose more prudently and/or weren&#39;t able to not work a fulltime job to ship off to a fancy school, this would be insanely unfair. Not to mention unfair to those that DID pay off their debt. All that freed up money will go back into the economy, meaning increased inflation and competition for scarce assets like housing. Don&#39;t reward the rich kids. Don&#39;t reward idiots who study things like gender-studies. Just create avenues to settle or refinance for those that are falling behind and of course, reflect the settled amount on the credit report so that there is a tradeoff to consider (bad credit vs relief) to keep the fakers away.Bernie sanders out here doin asmr and shithey old timer. don&#39;t break a hip! maga 2020, maga jr. 2024, the other maga 2028, and finally... Baron maga 2032Not going to waste my time educating Joe’s listeners on this kook’s ideology since YT’s Orwellian censors are on the lookout.Five thousand people clicked dislike before hearing the first wordPussy...America <b>Give This guy a chance</b> love from England &amp;  <b>our Free health care system</b>Grandad, give Joe just one more hour Sir.  MSNBC can wait.I&#39;m a Trump supporter and after seeing this, I can&#39;t believe this guy isn&#39;t ahead of Sleepy Joe by double digits.I&#39;m Canadian bud I promise you I cant go to any doctor I want if I want a good doctor I have to buy insurance on top of my tax funded care not to mention if dosnt cover prescriptions dental things like casts wheelchairs etc. Not to mention due to an over loaded system hospital wait times can be upwards of 12-13 hours so you may not even get that heart surgery. Besides you pay more per capita becuse there is more welth in amarica and you get better coverage not to mention how stupid it is to say per capita Bill Gates and 100 million homeless people are in a city block well per capita that city block makes 100 million a year. Same with health insurance.Bernie’s Next Speech: “It is ENTIRELY possible that medicare for all and the green new deal can be passed”Nothing is free, every thing cost money.The best managers in sport look to other managers and sports to learn, Bernie seems to look to the best of what other countries offer to improve America.Medicare and Social Security are unsustainable and a Ponzi scheme yet this doofus wants to expand it.Hell yeahs Bernie!!!Lotta righties mad in the comments lolI&#39;ve been daydreaming about this moment for monthsBernie &quot;DMT&quot; SandersBernie is lying .most people at gun shows are licensed dealers and they do back ground checks because they fear the <a href="http://atf.you/">atf.you</a> are lying Bernie shame on ypuWhat in the ACTUAL FCUK! 😳I completely disagree with Sanders on almost everything, but I&#39;m totally down for open unscripted conversation like this.The comment section is pretty clean, only because most are deeply brainwashed. So much so that just the sight of Bernie&#39;s face or his name printed is something they just won&#39;t clickAnytime Sanders is in a YT vid, you can really pick out the people who watch the news too much. They all have the same talking points, they all scream &quot;Socialist&quot;, while not being able to define the word. <br /><br /><br /><br />News flash people: Most of Bernie&#39;s policies &amp; ideas are merely getting us up to speed with the rest of the world. They aren&#39;t as crazy or radical as the US media would have you believe. There&#39;s a reason people in other countries are better educated, have higher standards of living &amp; are healthier than we are in the US. We used to set the trends for the rest of the world. Now we&#39;re like a washed-up rock star, stuck in the past, reliving our glory days. Doing the same thing we&#39;ve done for years &amp; decades &amp; then can&#39;t figure out why nothing changes. Why we&#39;re falling behind the rest of the world.Was this a JRE podcast or a softball game?  30 yr old Joe would love the success 50 yr old Joe has,  but I don&#39;t think he&#39;d respect the interviewer he has become. These questions were no more difficult than what you&#39;d expect from the networks.<br /><br /><br />How about you have Bernie explain what makes something valuable?  Guess what, if everybody has a million dollars, a million dollars loses it&#39;s power. If everybody has a college degree, college degrees become worthless.Boo this guys sucksThank you for having this Gem on!!! BERNIE BERNIE BERNIE!This country will never be a socialist country...Donald Trump....Bernie is a catfish on land. Sucking grime and muck out of the lint filled pockets of brainwashed humans.God damn Bernie, your voice makes my throat hurt. Rogan talking about kids on pills. Best podcast there is.Republicans:  Our country can&#39;t afford to give everyone medical coverage!<br /><br /><br />*supports $300+ Billion defense budget, including $4 Bil a year in foreign aid to Israel alone).Thank you Joe for letting Bernie use your platform!! 😀3 min in and Bernie is already proposing government forces, through legislation, news networks to make air time for candidates. So annoying. Not everything needs to be government forced.Bernie, sit up straight, and speak clearly please.I worry about Bernie if he get&#39;s elected.  He&#39;s going to (rightfully) uproot a lot of shitty industries (cartels to oil to wallstreet to pharma)  Secret Service better step it up.Fuck off BernieNice to see Bernie not yellingI agree with Bernie, dare I say it.<br />People need community, a opportunity to move up and enrich their lives so they dont desire drugs or feel traptomg yes!!!!!!Dnc wants to give a fair shot lawl<br /><br />They actively fucked him over last timeThank you Joe.Hey Joe i really have been waiting to see your anti vaccine guest<br />You had the biggest pro vaccine guy in the industry on your show why dont you talk to Del Bigtree i know he would love to come on your show.Joe Rogan Experience : Donald TrumpThat reality TV show answer was amazing I felt that in my bones it hurts my soul to watch the debates especially with the childish bickering that has come of late.When will we be seeing Trump on your show?Okay yeah big business Amazon and McDonald’s can afford the 15$ minimum wage but what about local small businesses? Any Bernie supporters have justification for this?Seems like this problem is always glossed over.2 minutes in and he already wants to legislate for the control of the media. Dang commie.I hate to say it, but I want him to invite Marianne Williamson. She would totally do it.Amen! Trump said our taxes would go down.. ha! What a joke!Thank you joe for making sure bernies radical old ass doesnt become POTUS.What is this shit softball interview joe?? Think you’ve started estrogen replacement therapy cause you are low TThis changed my perspective alot. Truly good person.Listen to this then go listen to Mark Blythe&#39;s lecture &quot;Why People Vote for Those Who Work Against Their Best Interests.&quot; You&#39;ll have deeper understanding into the MAGA phenomenon. You need uncritical thinkers to love a demagogue.Bernie the parasite...he&#39;s been living on taxpayer money for the last 40+ years.<br /><br />He&#39;s never owned or ran a business, but he still feels qualified to tell other people how to run theirs.That was fucking great. Puts the actual &quot;debates&quot; to shame. Joe Rogan. The man. As always.The democrat party is the country&#39;s largest extremist organizationWhere is jimmy Dore atLots of softballs...and I&#39;m a fan of Joe.No one would have done this if Tulsi Gabbard hadn&#39;t done this first.Thank you Joe for interviewing Bernie and reaffirming my decision to NEVER THINK of voting for this clown.Damn. They are gonna kill this man. Opening the eyesCan we just elect Joe to be the next moderator for the debates?Very cool joe. I&#39;m not a Bernie supporter  but... it&#39;s nice hearing from all sidesWhat might have been? The Dems lost my vote when they sabotaged Bernie in 2016.I haven’t watched the whole thing so I hope that Joe passed a joint to BernieAbout time the left got some representation on Joe Rogan. It&#39;s kinda tilted towards right wing guestsOnly an hour....thats 59 minutes too long<a href="https://www.accountingtoday.com/articles/tax-law-didnt-help-amazon-pay-zero-taxes-in-2018-it-was-just-savvy">https://www.accountingtoday.com/articles/tax-law-didnt-help-amazon-pay-zero-taxes-in-2018-it-was-just-savvy</a> Simple economics lesson...Very disappointed you didn&#39;t press him on what he means by &quot;assault weapons&quot;. He kept using that term, and it&#39;s a fairly meaningless one. He can&#39;t be referring to automatic weapons because they&#39;re already illegal for civilians to own. If he&#39;s referring to weapons like the AR-15, well, that&#39;s literally just a semiautomatic rifle that happens to look &quot;scary&quot; (and is also one of the most commonly owned rifles in the US). If I&#39;m going to take his policy proposals seriously, he&#39;s gotta stop using that term and specify what he actually means. Limits on magazine size? Limits on barrel length? What is an &quot;assault weapon&quot;, Bernie?It&#39;s a shame you decided to pander to leftist political correctness, Sanders.The function of our current health system is about profits, but taxing everyone who works with 10-20% tax hike just for this single program isn&#39;t the way to go. Almost 1/4 of your pay to single payer, tens of millions of people lose their jobs in the health industry, doctor shortage which we already have, a new system with many issues for at least 5 years to come, and 50 million leeches who dont have to pay any taxes to pay for this system. Ya, single payer will work great. We just go from one extreme to the other.<br />The key is ending lobbying, end forcing employers to offer health insurance(this and inflation is the biggest reason for low wages), and create laws to bring down prices in all aspects of health care. <br />Single payer would be the beginning of the end. Bernie say we must stand up and fight, yet end goal is a welfare state. Wont be standing tall and strong after a few years of that.<br />Let&#39;s attack pricing! We dont need a socialist answer to a capitalist problem.How much u get paid to do this 😭😭Joe Rogan just made ‘Podcasts’ the new ‘Talk Shows’ with this one.. well done 👏🏾1941 war in the pacific with China ... cool story bro.Fat and/or lazy people need to stop being fat and/or lazy.Bernie is right about the problems we face but socialism is not the right way to fix them. We dont trust politicians as a general rule of thumb. An unwritten rule. Yet you wanna give him the key to your bank account?Only thing left is for him to have Trump on.This podcast made me realise you could easily tax wall street a lot more for quite a cushy windfall. Maybe it will help with the volatility in the market, I could see a higher price tag make them think more carefully.COMMIE! TRUMP 2020Nice campaign ad for Bernie. Joe didn&#39;t really press him on any of the issues, but I understand what Joe is doing. As a conservative myself, I think this was cool to see.Free stuff 2020FREE EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!! YAY!!!!!!!I&quot;m not gay but I would definitely gag till spit is running down my face neck on Bernie&#39;s fat cock.Bernie immediately quotes YangStill not winning in 2020 but pretty good interview...Surprised this isn&#39;t longer! then again quality over quantitySome education he has. What triggers shooters? By God knows what? Lol say healthcare. Psychiatric care is shit. They deal with 0 biology it&#39;s all synthetic corporations money makers. You give under methylated meds (which is all) to over methylated patients you gonna get killers like this. Take notes. Next questionI didn’t know this was an ASMR channelFree healtcare, schooling, welfare, and housing for illegal immigrants... Bernie has fucking millions, why doesnt he house some illegal immigrants in his 3 mansions.Great video, interesting guest !Bernie still has his paper route.Really impressed with Bernie and Tulsi. Both honest public servants who haven&#39;t sold out and want to do the best for everybody.Haven’t even watched it yet <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stoked">#stoked</a>That was a great episode, can&#39;t wait to see Bernie come back and tell us about area 51 :D I hope we keep seeing more candidates on Joe Rogan where we can actually HEAR THEM SPEAK.  Bernie &amp; Yang so far, looking forward to more :D“It made me <b>CAWF</b>i Love how so many people hate on joe, every podcast, yet they still come back and listen to every episode. Keep up the great work joe, lover what you do.Joe talking about how Russia , China its corrupted ......  then Bernie throw numbers whats happenign in US --- LOLI commend sanders for coming on rogan, but I cannot even believe his economic stance. It is terrifying that he is as popular as he is. <br />No shit, who wouldn’t want free health care and college. I don’t want to cripple our economy to do it. <br />There is nothing wrong with rich people being rich. There is a lack of accountability in America. Sanders comes on here and tells several specific, heart breaking stories that pulls on the emotions of the viewer and then he follows that by making a broad statement about how things in America need to change. Then when joe asks him how he intends to do these things he attempts to quickly justify his claims by saying “it is being done in countries all over the world”. <br />In my opinion, bernie is completely un-American and has no sense of economic intelligence. Again, I would love for America to accomplish the things that bernie says, however, it is about how it is done. bernie clearly does not have a solution that will not decimate the economy and completely weaken America.Joe Rogan Wishlist: Debate between Jordan Peterson and Richard Spencer. If Peterson chickens out, Joe should invite Richard for a solo chat.Dude looks 146.OH VEYYYInstead of making it free can we make them not take the classes that don&#39;t matter for your major?   I took only 50crd out of my 130 in my major.  That&#39;s just waisted time and moneyNo fucking way! This happened?!Look at what America puts into r&amp;d. Not one government run healthcare is no where near our r&amp;d. What he is proposing is a general care, there could be a better option,  but we can only treat you by our standards without r&amp;d.Bernie “rules for thee and not for me” Sanders.  I guess it’s important to shine a light on dark places.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Beernie2020">#Beernie2020</a>I work in trading and his proposed tax on trading is ridiculous! There&#39;s already a high capital gain tax as it is already smh. I&#39;m a democrat but Bernie is really a fucking socialist. The tax on every trade will cause markets to slow down which will affect 401k portfolios and all classes of American society.Hi BernieHope joe gets somebody who doesn’t live in fairytale land. Free this free that raise wages blah blah. This idiot will get drumpf re elected.    Good work joe for giving trump 2020.So Bernie&#39;s big plan to get the leaders of Russia and China, practically dictatorships, to tackle climate change... is to appeal to the welfare of their children?  Has he thought this through?  He talks so much about the 1% and wealth inequality, but then thinks this is a viable tactic?  Their families are gonna be living in air-conditioned bunkers when the rest of us burn alive.You all get &quot;muskets&quot; dumb cunts,  USA is a garbage fire<b>7 trillion on Middle East wars</b><br /><br />Republicans: <b>crickets</b><br /><br /><b>10 trillion + bailing out Wall Street</b><br /><br />Republicans: ...<br /><br /><b>Trump gives a $1.4 trillion tax cut to the billionaire class</b><br /><br />Republicans: ...................<br /><br />Bernie proposes canceling student debt<br /><br />Media: WOAH THERE PALUnder a Bernie Sanders presidency there won&#39;t be YouTube anymore, it will be OurTube. LolHe looks down a lot while lying ! Mmmmhahahahahahahaha he is doing this to get his base stronger..fuck this goonI think it should be a requirement for every candidate to come on to this podcast. You really get to know someone when they’re able to speak for more than 30 seconds at a time.UH OH!! gotta hear this out!!!Healthcare is a human right? Rights are freedom from government oppression. Remember &quot;we hold these truths to be self evident.&quot; You aren&#39;t entitled to the expertise and skill of other citizens. Wth is he talking about?&quot;These guys have wealth, they have power and they couldn&#39;t care less for the needs for the working people of this country&quot; - Bernie Sanders.All guns can kill. It doesn&#39;t matter what type of gun, it can kill humans. Bernie is extremely misleading on this. At about the 36 minute mark he talks about how you can buy guns at a gun show and walk out. If the person does not have a license to sell, they must send it to a gun shop with said license in order for the backgrou d check to happen. In fact less than 2% of all gun crimes committed were with guns bought at a gun show. Since you have to buy those guns, they have to be transferred to the buyer and registered with the guns serial number. You cannot just willing sell them without the guns be traced back to you. Fucking misleading.Bernie&#39;s shirt was his Dad&#39;s from 1932.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> from the UK and AustraliaThis podcast changed my mind on Bernie. I&#39;m not a fuck trump guy, at all, but at least Bernie is telling the truth.  Maybe time to try someone new this election.the mainstream medias owners fear Bernie, the DNC screwed Bernie in the last election, Bernie had more votes than crooked Hillary, but crooked Hillary is corporate and bought by the banks, drug companies and more  (just like creepy pervert joe biden, and hillary 2.0 kamala harris) so they screwed Bernie and the people of America. The DNC must be stopped from illegally screwing the American people again.Drug control is like seat belts, protecting people from themselves. To an extent drug control also prevents a public nuisance. The solution is three bands of control for all laws, crime, offences and regulation. Regulation is there to prevent public drug use, licensing etc.Definitely better than the Breakfast Club interviews. Totally ridiculous!!Bernie just blue pilled Joe....<br />Fucking brilliantEvery time you raise the minimum wage, all the rest raise their prices for products.<br />You ain&#39;t going to be making any more money, when you raise the prices to adjust for the raise in pay rate.<br />Everybody makes more money, everybody raises prices.<br />You cant win.Fuck oath !!!!!!!!!Is Bernie willing to believe in the Corporate Climate Change agenda even though he realizes the same corporations are responsible for using deception, bribes and billions to protect their bottom line? I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s full of s*** or deceivedHow many pro trump listeners are on here ( I&#39;m one of them) heard this and dont think as badly about Bernie anymore ( not saying I would vote for him but some of his ideas and talking points are accurate and fair and I love Joe Rogan for giving me the opportunity to actually hear him out with no news headlines no crazy maniacs running around shouting people down just a one to one conversation about things that matter I wish trump would care about some of theese issues on top of all the other ass he is kickingBernie is the type of guy to test the water with his toes before he goes in to the poolSchool is expensive for the same reason medical is expensive. The government started subsidizing it. If it’s government backed you don’t have to compete.Ewwww Bernie&#39;s trash. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>Get trump rogan . Make it happen . Get cam Haynes and Colby tooOh it’s the “I’ll make everything free” guy. Where’s my check beooch?GUN CONTROL PARADOX<br /><br /><br />We&#39;ve fucked ourselves. For the past 10 years or so the narrative of &quot;give the shooter no press so they don&#39;t get famous.&quot; I believed that myself. But we&#39;ve made a monster in our ignorance. It is not easy to research these shooters at all. And so we just sit here trying to pull on threads we cannot observe. Really we&#39;ve fucked ourselves out of the knowledge we could be using to combat the threat of desparation. All these shootings are cries of desparation from a generation that feels powerless against a mechanism that torments them. <br /><br />It&#39;s disgusting that the voice of America is blindly accusing their opposition&#39;s ideologies  (for the most part falsely imposed) instead of analyzing the data and facts. Data and facts we were too scared to acquire because we blatantly wanted to shine no light on those violently crying out in despair.12 years left for the world call him out. AND who the fuck will be going to these rallies..i seen this in Washington State now live in TEXAS making three times the money.. And this is why TRUMP will win 2020. Corrupt leftist and by the way I&#39;m not a Nazi..just stop the lies....he can&#39;t tell you how he plans to do any of this just like osama and the other president because he has no plan to do any of that. He is full of shit! Young people are too offended and lazy but you promise to get them to build houses and shit? Liar.Holy Fucking SHIT. I never thought he’d go on. I was surprised when he had West on the show so I really wasn’t expecting THIS.I feel the Bern. 2020Sanders makes more money then me... He has to give me half his wealth now....Bernie was fair skinned until they spoke on aliens. WTF!? He turned red n damn n near burgundy 🤣berny is a fucken idiot that has been paid by most of the ppl he is talking about. what a crock of shit.I like Bernie but 2 things, 1) he cowered to Hillary Clinton like a bitch in 2016 when he had the entire country behind him 2) SJWs have too much ability to control him.   I like the health care stuff but I’m not confident he could stand up to drug companies if he couldn’t stand up to Hillary.Communist profit killer Bernie (never held a single job) Sandersanyone watching this, just realize they are both full of it.Who should we fear more the top 400 richest familes or the top 400 people in government?To the lottery ad before this, man go get some sand and start packing holes20 min in and all Bernie is doing is giving his stances with no real substance. How do you deal with Medicare for all? Raise minimum wage. Wtf? He keeps saying how glad he is to not have to give 12 second answers, but he has nothing real. So glad this guy isn’t gonna make itAt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=44m15s">44:15</a> old uncle Bernie claims we need above and beyond gun violence. It must be hard remembering your script uncle BernieBen Shapiro&#39;s brain watching this melted into a bigger puddle than Joey&#39;s when he slams 1000mg of Cheeba Chewsnotice how hes calling for a revolution and then saying its not radical, the  socialist policies he wants to implement will place so much restriction on american businesses, that it will force them to outsource jobs and manufacturing to other countries .  it will drive away and destory  buisness, its seen in every socialist country. making a momma and pop resurant or store forcefully pay 17 yearolds 15$ instead of choosing what they think is necessary will drive them out of business!😱This happened!😱Fun fact: Bernie supporters and Trump supporters have more in common than either one thinks. Trump was smart enough to campaign on everything Bernie has actually done and thats why he won. Ending wars, healthcare for all, raising the middle class wages, etc. If we &quot;dropped our buffs&quot; and stop letting the political Clinton/Bush Dem/Repub assholes divide us, we could have a TRUE INDEPENDENT president in Bernie Sanders that its working people and not the 1%. Truth. Fn. Bomb.Your mass shooting stats are retarded on an unbelievable level. All those 200 you stated are quite literally gang related when 4 or more hoodbros are taken out. In which those firearms are more than likely stolen.Holy shit!All I heard was taxes, taxes, taxes. Nah I’m good.Couldnt make ir 2 min into this shit podcastShoulda had Eddie on to ask Bernie about conspiraciesWow Bernie’s not too badSANDERS IS A FUCKIN&#39; TOOL.<br />STAY OUTTA OFFICE YA OLD COOT<br />IF YOU LIKED THIS, YOU&#39;RE NOT AMERICAN.Bernie is the real deal. 🔥Amazing episodeGreat job Joe!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23elpasostrong">#elpasostrong</a>I wonder how many memes will be created from this one episode?i cant watch rn can what are all those dislikes for?Trumptards:  We are not a socialist country!<br /><br /><br />OK,  so you want to end Social Security?  close public schools?  shut down public roads?Good convo, but he’s just wrong thinking banning semi auto “assault” rifles is going to do anythingWhat a fantastic podcast!  Excellent work, y&#39;all!  Bernie is the fucking man!two heebs fooling the world and everyone is wetting their pants lol. america got gay forealThere’s only two reasons I’ll ever use my “assault rifle” to kill and have absolutely no desire to ever use them in any other way than these two reasons:<br />1) You try to harm me or my family <br />2) You try to take them from meBern gang!10 years younger and this guy would be the next president... easy.Joe,<br />He is being waaaaay disingenuous with his numbers. Canada is a nightmare if you need to go to a specialist. I work with a bunch of Canadians and NONE of them brag about the Canadian healthcare system. In fact most come here for their medical care. Also he is not being forthright it how bad the government currently runs medicare and medicaid. Billions for those two and its highly inefficient. So Bernie comes in and says lets EXPAND a government agency that is already broken and wastes billions in taxpayer money.Specialist physicians surveyed report a median waiting time of 19.8 weeks between referral from a general practitioner and receipt of treatment in Canada.   No thank you!!Much love Joe. Biggest respects for having this type of person on your show... So everyone can see how much of FUCKING idiot this bloke that is.. not all ideas are bad, but fuck. This man and his ideas and values are finished people like him need to keep his old ass ideas in the past and the new fresh people and ideas need to move the world forwardHey Bernie, fuck YOU and your gun rights &quot;concessions&quot;.Lots of promises, little plan of actionKilling it, Joe!  Bernie in the house!I&#39;VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONGThe first ad in this video was a drug ad LMFAOsomeone get berni a fucking drink. man clearly needs to wet his whistle.The whole “gun show loop hole” is a myth... you can find videos of people trying to do that and being turned down at gun shows. Most notably Steven crowder has a video of him trying to do so and getting turned Down. But I do love that joe has him onToo short... :(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a>I don&#39;t understand why Politicians aren&#39;t running personal YouTube channels to discuss issues properly in-depth without the media narrative. I don&#39;t agree with Bernie at all really because of economics, but it&#39;s nice to hear the long form conversation without agenda.Ignoring a major component to why drugs companies are allowed to charge so much... ignoring how government has allowed them to by snuffing competition with absurd patenting laws  government centralization doesn’t work anywhereI heard Bernie talked to a woman...If Bernie really thinks his parents didn’t pay a nickel for public schools he obviously never looks at his property tax break down.that was cool as fuck&quot;If i took my clothes off&quot;  AYYY NAKED BERNIE 😉😉😉Bernie, a corporate master shill Frankist 😈Trump nextJoe Rogan and Bernie Sanders, What!?Hillary Clinton would NEVER do this podcast.Time to have Trump on now!  Bernie made good points but i would love to here Trumps opinions as well.  Make it happen JoeWow, Bernie isn&#39;t yelling. He sounds like a smooth jazz DJ.Bernie wants the racist police armed and citizens notBernie tells it as it is. Corporations have hijacked US politics. Ike was right, military industrial complex needs to be disassembled, financial, medical and educational sector strictly regulated.Joe Rogan been out here picking up all the slackDammit. I was expecting to smash a thumbs down within seconds. I hate having to reconsider my thoughts.Kinda confused about where he stands on gun control. Seems like he wants increase on regulations/permissions but also said that he wants to ban assault weapons but, didn&#39;t make it seem like the latter would necessarily be part of his platform.Bernie honeymooned in RussiaBernie &quot;I just talked to a guy/woman&quot; SandersRespect for Bernie for doing this!I’ve never clicked so fast <br />Wowsomeone call the future foundation, theres too much despairCan’t trust a man who never looks you in the eyeAfter years of watching Seinfeld it was nice to finally see Steinbrenner’s face.Hi I’m Bernie and we shall have pudding cups for all!This podcast is offically lame.  Too political.  I&#39;m sticking to Kill Tony and Joey Diaz podcast.  Fuck Bernie BTW.&quot;The game is rigged&quot;<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/x6S1o3D2GiI">https://youtu.be/x6S1o3D2GiI</a>He’s a lot more rational than I expected but how do we pay for it... a tax on trading will lead to lower volume which will lead to lower yields so it won’t cover itNot saying I disagree with his goals but, it’s how we get there that turns me off on Bernie. Props to him for coming and talking. I just feel like he will limit my freedom as an individual. Once freedom is gone, as time goes by, it’s very hard to get it back in the future.Fossil fuels are sustainable. Renovating downtown is short term. I don’t think Bernie realizes how many jobs in America are directly related to the fossil fuel industry.WowI have just two questions for Mr. Sanders in regards to climate change .... 1) If we have to abandon fossil fuels in the next 12yrs or so, why not make a couple of 4th Gen nuclear plants that have zero carbon omissions and have a safety record that is safer than the US Navy&#39;s? and 2) Speaking of US Navy, WHY do you think that any other nation on earth is going to willingly give up the use of fossil fuels when it is required to operate EVERY military vehicle from the basic lawnmower on parade grounds to Jet fighters? I&#39;m just saying, I don&#39;t really see China or Russia willing to forge their tank/jet forces, or their trucks for food or ambulances/helicopters for wounded soldiers.... so, tell me again how to get off of fossil fuels when absolutely NOBODY is going to be willing to go back to riding horses as &quot;cavalry&quot; and birds for &#39;air force&quot; power?Bernie does sound Utopian mainly because as one man he is helpless to transform society &amp; the obvious disparity in wealth distributuon as an American President...the 1% might agree to a $15 per hr wage...but they are not going to deminish their control &amp; power one iotaOur government shouldn&#39;t be allowed to purchase assault style weapons. They&#39;ve killed more people than any government in history.What happened to Joey Diaz? He looks differentSuggestion: what if people could own assault rifles, under the condition that they join the service. The military already vets and trains people to the best of their ability to handle guns.  Obviously, they&#39;re not perfect at it. But i say if you are an active member or retired honorably veteran, you&#39;ve earned the right and respect to own a military weapon. Plus the military already has the infrastructure to handle it. Plus we can put the responsibility on their heads just to ensure they&#39;d do the best job they can... Life&#39;s are counting on it.<br /><br />Just food for thought...COUP FOR JOE, ONE OF A NUMBER OF GREAT INTERVIEWS, KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!!!!Wow this show is really going to shit.Wow. Way to not pitch softball questions. Way to answer. The debates should be on JRESo what happens when the corporation say Oh no we&#39;re based in Ireland I&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t tax usI liked itOld.. Spineless..POS. Why anyone would watch this is beyond me..this guy should kill himselfYes!Definitely disappointed in joes opportunity to ask tuff questions. It makes me want to pull my hair out.  This was wasted moment to really connect with normal productive people.At least 1 semi-serious candidate from 2016, and now 3 Primary Dems from the 2020 cycle (including a Frontrunner!)<br /><br />By 2024 Joe&#39;s gonna be hosting the debates himself on YouTube!Great interviewI don&#39;t like this Commie but ill listen to him if joe is interviewing himKinda disappointed joe didnt mention that way more murders are committed with hand guns. Seems odd that they demonize certain guns even though hand guns are racist and kill more black people than any other gun.My mid level carpenters make $15/hr. you&#39;d put a lot of construction out of businessI have to listen and see if he talks about the over taxed broke middle class leaving his homestate in record numbers.....Alright Joe, you got Bernie here. Bring in the someone from Trump&#39;s side as well. Perhaps Jr. would be interested?Bernie &quot;All that I&#39;m saying&quot; SandersThe problem i see is that if you raise the minimum wage, things will rise around it as wellThe missinformation in this episode is strong. Bernie is genuinely clueless about how effective New Zealand&#39;s gun program has been.don&#39;t dislike this video just because you are a republican. hear the man out and give counter arguments but respect eachothers viewsok can you get Trump and colby at the same time 🙏😂Bernie &quot;bread lines are a good thing&quot; Sanders.wish rogans audience had less right wing douche bagsThe media has taken no responsibility for the inappropriate graphics, elementary sound bites and even big cinematic music cues during a hot news day  which excites young stupid white boys, there needs to be legislation that promotes responsible broadcasting of such news items to avoid creating a mythical image of the dopey bastards doing this ( not a block on free speech, just grown up news approach ) remember when they tried to get us to call the Colorado cinema shooter &quot;The Joker Shooter&quot; It is irresponsible and frightening how the Media push this type of story like a promo for a new action show.This is not simply a mental illness problem it is a Narcissism problem. It&#39;s not some kid suffering from ADD or Bi Polar its entitlement.I wonder how long joe had to rehearse those questions....I think this type of stuff is why he ain’t live any more. Can’t have big time politicians stepping in it.I don’t care what people say about Bernie being a communist. He genuinely cares about the common person and really wants to help.He should have on President Trump I’m seriousJoe, alpha Male,  Bernie, beta Male,  1 hour interview...enough saidWe want kanyeBERN THE SWAMPJoe, please(!) always use your powers for good (No platform is above the rest). As I see it you are . Keep it up.He should stay in CanadaTrump 2020 lets goWhat&#39;s it like spending summers in the USSR Bernstine?Insead of making college free just cancel the option of student loans entirely so only people that can afford college go to college no more people in student loan debt permanently problem fixedWhat? My favorite Alt-Right podcaster is doing a podcast with Bernie Sanders? I suppose Bernie Sanders is Alt-Right now?Broke: Media<br />Woke: Social Media<br />Bespoke: Socialist MediaAmerica, do yourselves a favour and ELECT this man. The people who criticize his political ideas are people who don&#39;t understand the difference between social democracy, and socialism. They are two vastly different things.  I am a Canadian. Yes, our medical system has wait lists and is over burdened, but would you like a system that drains your life savings instead like you have now? Bernie&#39;s ideas are very moderate compared to some of our politicians here. He&#39;d be great for your country. <br /><br />Bernie Sanders isn&#39;t getting sucked into political bullshit. He wants to HELP you.Corruption issues are achievable, regardless of who the POTUS is.<br />Simply holding drug companies accountable, allowing student debt bankruptcy, and removing tax free status on certain businesses would do great things.It’s hard to connect with Sanders as a person, he repeats the same political talking points. <br />I would have liked to see a more authentic side of him.I think politicans are missing the mark on gun control. It&#39;s magazine capacity you should be going after. If the shooters were only limited to 10-15 round mags. The outcome would be vastly different.A lot of problems not many solutions though, I&#39;m afraid.Joe: Have you ever tried DMT?<br />Bernie: No, but I&#39;ll gladly take some of yours.free health care is bull shit! I&#39;m Canadian its bull shit only the sick fucks use it what if you never get sick like me and just pay for it!! ya its fair berny you fucken idiot!Softball questions...👎.wow, i agree with Bernie on something, it is a reality tv show.Thanx for this conversation Joe. Berni Sanders 2020!You&#39;ll never get trump on here on that format.. Too stupid to hold a conversation ffs.. But it would be comedy gold if he did.. 😂AMAZING!Bernie Sanders:  60+ % taxes, gun confiscation, complete gov&#39;t control.I just crapped my pants, seeing this in my feed! <br />Thank you so much for going on Bernie, and also thank you how for finally giving him a chance to actually talk.Please Bernie. What&#39;s your definition of wealth ?Bernie the millionaire with 3 houses criticizing wealthy people. 🤣🤣🤣This guys knowledge on guns is so wrong. He either has no idea or is purposfully and blatantly lying.Joe why is sound going in and out. Bernie Sanders 2020!! Feel the 🔥 burn! Thanks Joe for getting him on.You need trump onThis is going to be painful to listen toI just got my 9mm smith&amp;wesson...Never ever! Trust a fucking jew!I can&#39;t remember the last time i done cocaine and diddnt listen to a Joe Rogan podcastimagine if he had on bernie sanders and joey diazHave Trump on!I like the guy, but he just repeats himself and his stories. I get it, that&#39;s what he kinda has to do, but it didn&#39;t work 4 years ago, it&#39;s not going to work now.. Plus, you can always tell he&#39;s just trying to talk at you, not with you, because he looks down and when he finishes his statement he does a facial tick of &quot;There I&#39;ve said it, next talking point.&quot;Bernie looks like he has cardboard in his shoe.I bet most of the dislikes came from trumpers who didn’t even watch the interview haha trigggggggeredGo figured Joe is Alt Left!!!About to watch. I so hope Joe got him to smoke a blunt 🤞46Bernie doesn&#39;t seem to understand that our healthcare isn&#39;t free, in Canada. We pay for it through taxes all of our lives. I&#39;d have to do the math, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a huge amount. Especially considering that you might not even need it for the major part of your life; you still pay for it.<br /><br />&quot;Coverage is publicly-funded, meaning that the funds come from federal and provincial taxes. Some estimates, such as those of the Fraser Institute, put the average cost at about $5,789 a year per person. Meaning Canadian healthcare is far from free.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="https://www.aimseducation.edu/blog/us-vs-canadian-healthcare-differences/%C2%A0">https://www.aimseducation.edu/blog/us-vs-canadian-healthcare-differences/ </a><br /><br />Is it better or worse? I guess that&#39;s debatable, but you gotta be honest when saying those things, it can put the wrong idea into people&#39;s minds. Not only that, but capitalism is good for innovation. I want my doctors and scientists to earn good money. Where I think the real issue lies, is with big pharma, there&#39;s clearly not enough competition and I know it might sound conspiratorial, but the idea that a company could &quot;hide&quot; a cure or a drug for profit is pure evil.Whoa! Holy fuck did he sidestep the UFO question hmmmmmmmmCan we have Dave chappelle in the showThanks, Joe.  I have always thought that Bernie is genuine and believes in what he talks about.  That was very apparent with your discussion with him.  While I don&#39;t agree with his politics, I appreciate and respect him for having a down to earth discussion with you!How is this not on trending right now D:Whether you support Bernie or not, it is important to listen to both sides of every argument. If you aren’t educated on both sides then your opinion is irrelevantBernie must have asked for a short one. Can’t risk too much chance for being exposed as the commie con man he is. Meanwhile Jones does 5+ hoursCan you all stand together and make America great again? Can you Americans?? CAN YOU?&quot;Drug companies overcharge us and scam us on everything, and the reason why they&#39;re allowed to get away with it is because we don&#39;t negotiate with the drug companies&quot;-Bernie<br /><br /><br />Normal person: So the solution would be to dismantle the stranglehold that drug companies have on medicine and introduce a free market into healthcare so medicine and hospital visits are no longer expensive?<br /><br /><br />Bernie Sanders: C O M M U N I S M  I S  A  H E U M A N E  R I G H T<br /><br /><br />So close, yet so far.Materialists always think despair has to do with a lack of money, affluence, or some kind of wealth. The idea that people just hate and loathe each other because there is no moral, ethical, or cultural foundation in this country never seems to occur to them.Needs to get Trump on.What a waste of a podcast episodeGot to love Joe, He can interview anyone. Bernie although I don&#39;t agree with him on everything. He definitely has some good points, esp on guns and mental health.Wow! I didn&#39;t think this would happen!&quot;3 people have more combined wealth than 164 MILLION people (bottom half of America)  1% of Americans own as much wealth as 92% of Americans!  What Bernie doesn&#39;t talk about, this is a result of socialism for the top 1% who don&#39;t pay taxes and our biggest welfare program is MiSC &quot;Military Incorporated Socialist Complex&quot; .  Instead of creating jobs rebuilding infrastructure and sustainable energy in America, we spend 60% of our federal tax dollars to use our military as free security guards occupations for transnational corporations who outsource our jobs overseas by exploiting other countries and not reinvesting any profits back into the U.S. economy.  This is insanity folks...Wonder how this would have gone if Tim Pool was here as well?I love how Bernie says all the fairy tail points to his plan but none of the actually bad things. I love Rogan but sometimes he does not grill or press people to be honest. He let&#39;s people just say whatever without any pressure... remember how he just let Twitter Jack Dorsey  say whatever without pressing on him? He is doing the same with Bernie. A salesman will always tell you the good stuff but not any of the bad stuff that their products have. As for the economics of Bernie.... yeah sorry man but he is a snake selling snake oil.guns don&#39;t kill people people whacked out on pills do <br /><br />A SOCIALIST WHO WANTS TO BAN GUNS....<br />WHAT A SURPRISE!<br />K.A.G. 2020Anyone who doesn’t say increase medical school admissions is retarded on healthcare.really would like to get ol Bernie highLove Bernie!!2020!!!This is the first comment I’ve ever made. I just wanted to say NOW THIS IS EPICHe had to ask about aliens<b>For 60 years 60 years Bernie fights for humans rights and people still not vote for him!!! Most people are bad and they don&#39;t deserve anything in life</b><br />Republican billionaires pays money to rights wings youtubers to spread hateful messages and what happened is a lot of people following evil thoughts coz evilness in their genetic <br /><b>If Bernie wouldn&#39;t be a president I will lost my belief in humanity</b>Pharmaceutical industries are gangster  as FUCK.. bernie was talkig about big pharma having a commercial during his debate and he was interrupted by a commercial for a new depression drug commercial on youtube😂😂Massive anti Bernie shilling  in the comments.I was not expecting to see this today. Let&#39;s see how this goes.Bernie is a fuck stickAs soon as he said Climate Change I was out. Can&#39;t take anyone serious after that rolls out of their mouth!Socialist moron!!JUST ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTIONS BERNIEIn Canada you get put on a waiting list and you get pushed back while you get worse. Plenty of meds you need also cost, only some are free.  Canada is a dogshit example. The waiting is insane.Joe really knows how to get the guests on, but god damn this guys monetary policies freak me out.You Yanks keep crying about socialism, the man said democratic socialism like every civilized country in the world has - Europe as well as your next door neighbours to the north. U live in the richest country in the world, u pay taxes pretty much on par with what u think are &#39;socialist&#39; countries, yet even the roads in America are shit. No healthcare, shit education, mental patients all over your streets. Where are ur tax dollars going?? Ohhh to subsidizing corporate taxes and paying for fancy weapons to bomb poor people in third world countries with. Ohh it&#39;s so fkn obvious and uncomplicated, yet you lil hoes still gona go cry about waaaaahhhh socialism 🤣🤣🤣Not only do drugs being illegal cause all this criminal behavior,  the EXTREME majority of murders are committed by THESE SAME CRIMINALS.Socialism is FascismI love how broke ass conservatives are against socialist programs that will only benefit them!I sure like the sound of that.<br />&quot;What are you gonna do President Bernie. &quot;Only an HR!YYEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!<br />NICE!Democrats always complain about guns. Guns don&#39;t kill people. Stupid and/or ill people kill people. I&#39;m not giving up my Ak-47, M4A2 or my AP9U suck Burnie !!The way Bernie carefully words his statements and political rhetoric makes me ill. He is SO FUCKING DRAMATIC. Yes close tax loopholes, yes legislate lobbyists out of DC, yes expand on free healthcare but for God&#39;s sake stop saying &quot;WE NEED TO FIGHT&quot;, &quot;WE NEED TO RISE UP&quot;, &quot;WE NEED TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS&quot;, &quot;ITS THE CORPORATE ELITES FAULT&quot;. Has the thought that these &quot;elites&quot; just don&#39;t fucking like him and will move mountains so he doesn&#39;t get shit done ever cross his mind?Joe! I am Canadian and have no dog in this fight (other than living like a homeowner with a babbling, senile old man with a large weapons collection and obvious mental health issues living next door to you!) but you absolutely HAVE to get &quot;Mayor Pete&quot; on the show! He is BY FAR the most articulate and thoughtful candidate in the running this cycle. He fucking GETS IT! Your nation NEEDS a generational shift in policy and direction. He has a plan for that. A good plan. A well thought out plan. A &quot;do-able&quot; plan. Give him a chance America! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CanadiansforMayorPete">#CanadiansforMayorPete</a>The greatest con was convincing the poor to feel bad for the wealthy. Greed controls this country and we are all complicit for allowing it.Hold shitBernie is a crazy old Socialist nut job. Not a chance.My health care was great until Obama care now I have none I have to pay cash and still have to pay that fucking tax the last three yearsWatched the whole thing. All I remember is this droning voice of his.pingtrip is going to have a field day with this oneYESHoly fuck.Good interview, but TRUMP 2020!Bernie “Everything is Free”SandersYOU SHOULDVE ASKED HIM WHAT HE MEANT BY “WHITE PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE POOR” AND ALSO THABKS TO BEENIES BELOVED MINIMUM WAGE NY IS PROJECTED TO LOSE 3MIL JOBS LMAOCan anybody link me to the part where Joe challenged him on anything? Where Joe didn&#39;t just throw up a slow pitch softball so the old man can ramble and not answer questions? He challenged Tulsi a little bit at least. Good job getting a future former candidate again.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m58s">2:58</a> in to the convo and hes already made his first &quot;free to everyone&quot; statementI would vote for him just for the UFO thing..Joe Rogan for host of debates!Haven’t had a chance to check this out yet, does he ask Bernie about the Democratic Socialist Convention?Get Bernie Sanders on with Jorden Peterson/Ben Shapiro!!Did he ask to borrow money while he was there?FREE ! FREE FREE FREE ! Plus a bunch of BSPlease vote for him.Joe . you need to listen better. .stop repeating  yourselfWowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwAs a former Bernie fan... it is so sad to just hear him keep talking in circles. Andrew Yang actually answers the questions and has solutions!Just starting. Hope Joe asks Bernie about when he used to say the Soviet Union was a paragon of virtue.3 minutes in and he says the magic “it should be free” phrase. 😂😂Thanks for the podcast joe. It was intresting to hear this canidates political ideologys. I still dont find myself agreeing with a lot of his views. But I can see where he comes from.I&#39;m an immigrant from the UK. Can someone explain why a ban on &quot;assault rifles&quot; like AR15s is such a bad idea? If protecting yourself is the main concern, what&#39;s wrong with just having handguns or shotguns? Normal every day people don&#39;t need army-style weapons in my opinion. I&#39;d like to hear thoughts from every side of politics.Watch out for those Russian folks trying to interfere, you can see them as the first reply to a comment with a lot of likes to draw people&#39;s attention.What is an assault weapon? You mean a semi automatic weapon? A lot of Pistols are semi automatic..are you gonna ban any weapon that’s not a revolver or bolt action?FUCK OFF. 300 million weapons in America for a good reason cause you  can ban them but you will not take them all!!Bernie “that’s a deep question watch me dodge it” Sandersat 36 minutes when he commends police... what were the police using to subdue the shooter bernie? It wasn&#39;t swordsThere you have it folks. He said it himself. If Bernie is elected president, he will make marijuana legal by executive order......LET&#39;S GET THIS MAN INTO OFFICE ASAP.All Bernie does is speak truth and words of compassionYeah Bernie on Joe Rogan this is huge so he can get the Six Million viewers.. what a joke. All Democrats. Yes in America when you need surgery you get it the next week in Canada you get at 8 months from when you need it. Stop bullshitting and let&#39;s talk about how you want felons to vote!Vote for him to legalize weed!!Left right up down who gives a fuck Bernie is all about US. THE PEOPLE!!From fleshlight ads to this. Wow. Good job Joe.Wow this actually makes me like Bernie Sanders more than I did before, having him explain his ideas in a longer format. I would love if candidates did this format far more.Bernard goes hardJoe u couldve pressed this moron. Instead u let him just rambleHow can you trust someone who can&#39;t even look you in the eyes when he speaks? The guy stares at the table and spews crap.Soooooo, he just went basic bitch democratic talking points, and thinks this is the way to the heart of the people? Fuxk you dudeBernie is a modern day Bolshevik<br /> &quot;those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it&quot; - George SantayanaI don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever listened to someone more full of it than Sanders but his heart is in the right place. At the same time, I can&#39;t stand his greed for unearned achievements and sense of socialist entitlement so I have no use for him or people like him. So nuts to him and everything he says.Im not an american citizen but all these candidates are so damn incompetent. False promises after false promises. Gtfo. <br />Easy win for Trump2020.Respect to Bernie for doing a podcast, but theres no such thing as assault weapons😂Bernie is the 1%So the California universities are ripping people off? No way that I the liberal nirvana .they claim to be the shining state on the hill everyone needs to be<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MoscowMitch">#MoscowMitch</a> not coming on hereHow many votes did this video get? Must be the Russian bots.Good on you Joe for doing this, and good on Bernie also!! I hope that everyone who loves Joes podcast listens closely and puts their preconceptions aside and actually listens to this guy... he’s fighting the same liberals that so many libertarians and conservatives are... he’s on the side of regular people, period! Bernie 2020 Tulsi 2020!! ❤️❤️I AM Canadian and I would vote for Bernie in a heartbeat if I was American. Universal health care is a human right, Americas system is broken and not for the people, the drug companies are corrupt, the politicians are bought and cowards, not Bernie he gives a damnBernie could eat a pineapple through a letterbox.Ho Ho HoooVoted Bernie in 16 but I’m not feelin it this time. This interview didn’t help unfortunately. Bernie is solid and he’s stayed on message pretty much his whole life but he missed his chance in 2016.Candidates like Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, and Bernie Sanders appear on Joe Rogan because they speak the truth and MSM hates candidates who speak the truth.disgusting right wing corporatist trash downvoting this vidThe problem with politicians is that they think they have a solution to everything. I work in education for example. Politicians need to leave education and other fields to people who have worked in the field all their lives and not some career politician with a law degree with no expertise in the field. A smaller government is the solution not a bigger more powerful one Bernie fanaticises over.The Secretary of Energy used to have a Doctorate of Nuclear Physics, the new one has a Bachelor&#39;s of Animal Science.NO FUCKING WAY TWO OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE 🙃🙃🙃🙃😁😁😁👍👍👍👍🙃🙃🙃👋👍👍👍👍This will be good lolYeah, Bernie can go fuck himself. He moved the goalpost every time.Good job Joe!Of course Bernie wants free healthcare for all... his cousin own the fuckin scripts they&#39;ll be handing outBernie is a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing. He is a living contradiction globalist!Do trump next.can you imagine the  contentIf Joe Rogan have Donald Trump on while President, now that’s gonna be good!Thanks Joe! You should get all the candidates on. It will be better than any debate.Paying off student loans is elitist enabling of shitty parenting. Asking a plumber to pay for a lawyers college and fraternity cost is retired. Bernie is retarded.Bernie isnt a socialist. He&#39;s just doesn&#39;t have realistic policies. Raise the minimum wage and the cost of living will raise drastically across the board.  A 4 for $4 at Wendy&#39;s will turn into the 4 for $10Get Trump on.WowThe Joe “Socialism” Rogan Experience.Absolute jokeBernie you had me until you started taking guns. Far more people die from medical accidents, car accidents, and blunt force than guns but nobody wants to ban sugar or surgery.I actually have a bit more respect for Bernie after this. Would love to see Tulsi and Bernie ticketWOOOOOOOOAAAAHHH, I dont even give a damn bout Bernie, just that Joe got him on the podcastso you bought insulin much cheaper in Canada ... i thought it was all free...Great job Joe better than all the establishment media.  YouTube should have a debate, joe rogan can take care of it, he ask better questions.I dare Sanders to go on Ben Shapiro Sunday special...Surprised Joe didn&#39;t start plying Bernie with booze&quot;i&#39;m a dictator, i like the dictatorships and all that stuff, and the truth is Joe that you look at the issues that i campaign on, what i believe, they&#39;re really not terribly radical. they exist in many countries all over the world.&quot;<br /><br />Oh, bernie, bernie. you old warmongering fox. Putin, Gaddafi, Assad, everyone&#39;s a dictator but you. you prefer to pull the strings from the shadows, don&#39;t you. Who&#39;s next on your list. Climate&#39;s acting like a dictator lately to us humans. You wanna bomb it? Maybe you can do it with some enriched uranium, but first you have to accuse it of developing chemical weapons ..The day the government successfully takes away the public&#39;s right to own fire arms as protection against a tyrannical government is the day this country falls and becomes like the rest of the world... I will no longer want to live in this country because it will be open season on the people at that time and they can get away with absolutely anything and everything. As soon as you give something up to government you will never ever get it back. 2 steps forward 1 step back at all times, as soon as you take one step back you can no longer get that step forward again...   look at the history of this country and all other countries. Its proven fucking fact.Cant get specific about stopping the pharmaceutical companies&quot;If you get heart surgury in canada you know what your bill is ... zero&quot; <br /><br />Wrong, you get charged for it every fucking paycheck, even if you are responsible to live a heart healthy lifestyle.  You can pay off debt you incurred, you can&#39;t pay off taxes you didn&#39;t incur. America has enough fat asses as it is, at least they pay for their choices.According to Bernie Joe should not have a gun... drug use😳I&#39;ll admit that I haven&#39;t watched the whole podcast yet, but so far this is rediculous, Joe isn&#39;t calling him out with any hard questions. If I wanted to hear a Bernie speech answering softball questions I could find that other places. Also it&#39;s funny hearing a millionaire who&#39;s richer than I&#39;ll ever be talk about how some people in America are too rich when he&#39;s one of them😂 idiotWoahfuck all yall trump supporters and racist mutha fuckersNO WAY THIS HAPPENEDwatch other countries&#39; farms vote this down!!!!Of course all you California pussies will vote for this Skeletor looking motherfucker.   TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!Congratulations Joe, you’ve got some serious political clout to get Bernie on!The candidate who is willing to stand up against Wall Street, let&#39;s go Bernie!Like he was saying... if we put small taxes on stocks/bonds, big corporations and even marijuana if made federally legal, we would have more than enough money over time to pay for Medicare and free collegeBernie : it.was virtually free<br />Joe: how much is it now<br />Bernie: <b>I dunt fukin know ya cunt</b>Does it bother anyone else that Bernie doesn&#39;t look at Joe when talking?Never forget Joe Rogan with Crowder and JaredThis is how you know This podcast is extremely powerful and it can’t be Joe in control. Someone’s pulling the strings forsure.I agree with something and then he loses me. Healthcare sounds reasonable but then free college? Why make learning useless things free? I might support free for those that can&#39;t afford it and have high scores and go into stem. But not some useless liberal arts degree when the kid will never work in the industryJOE ROGAN DEMOCRATIC DEBATES98% of mass shootings are by schwoogies...People are insane and medicated because of listening to god awful politicians like Bernie... all of them are so terrible, politicians are to BLAME for it all.Gotta sneak in that last question about aliens.Wtf :pGet Trump onBernie should&#39;ve been a Jockey.ONLY ONE HOUR OMG WTFthe desk is so impressive that bernie keeps looking at itFuck it i said it last time he lost but bernie for presidentI am 23 have never signed up to vote and its almost sad to say but Bernie you have my vote. Dont disappoint me man.Gimme your moneyLet&#39;s get Trump to show up on Joe&#39;s show.  That would be epic/awesome.This is so short, I wonder why?This isnt Russia. Get this commie out of here.Commie swineJoe should have every candidate on his show. This format really gives one a chance to voice opinions thoughtfully and in whole. This format should replace the debates. Education. In lieu of federal support for higher education, the government has implemented student loans. It is a way to double dip on the american people. They get the interest on the loan and get your federal tax dollars as well.I&#39;m white i know what it&#39;s like to be poor i know what it&#39;s like to live in a&quot;ghetto&quot; this guy Bernie sanders is a joke.. when he said white people dont know what it&#39;s like to be poor i lost all respect for himBernie, curb your enthusiasm...Joe, i love u but health care is Not A Human Right.  Thats like saying you have the right to someone elses labor.  Basically forced service...ie slavery.  And please if u can, tell me one government program that isnt full of waist fraud and malfeasance.  Name one that does a better job than a private company that does the same thing.  The more government provides the more it controls, the more it can take from u... i could go on and on but i wont bore u..lol.  please have an Austrian economist as a guest to combat this crap Bernie is throwing at u.  Tom Woods or a Robert Murphy would be 2 good choices.    Thanks Joe!!Full shill mode activated.Please get Trump on!!!Play the Bernie Sanders Drinking Game. comrades<br />Take a drink every time Bernie says...<br />- Free<br />- Human right<br />- Percent<br />- Labour <br />- Wage<br />- Wall streetLooked down the entire time he was speaking.The only candidate willing to fight tooth and nail for the ordinary person. Feel the Bern!!About time!Mr sanders, what countries give free airtime to all candidates?<br />The UK just demonstrated jist how un democratice they really are by allowing those in power to apoint a leader! That is NOT democratic!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m15s">5:15</a> Shouldnt food &amp; water be a basic human right?&quot;Président Bernie&quot; I like the sound of that!I love that final question.Bernie is a Ralph Steadman drawing.giving sanders free airtime an offer he would never refuse5k dislikes?   Those 5 thousand people should drown themselfes right now and stop breathing our precious oxygen.Free healthcare and free education are the basics. You can charge for everything else.I’d actually vote for Bernie it wasn’t open borderhow can i downvote this more then onceI can&#39;t believe he&#39;s the dick joke fear factor guy.its funny how most these bernie lovers are not tax payers and probably dont understand the economy atm...Interview trump this guy is boringI can&#39;t believe Joe didn&#39;t try to get Bernie into jiu jitsu... lolOne of the few honest politicians who wants to make America great again.Joe is very inconsistent on climate changeOver the next hour and seven minutes will Joe Rogan ask the tough question?! <br /><br />Bernie the American people want to know: “Have you tried DMT?” <br />🏁🐐😂Before I watch, does Bernie blaze up?!?!I really wish do you push harderHell fucking yes, haven&#39;t even watched it yet, but hell yes!If you think health CARE is a human right, then you have no problem enslaving doctors. Therefore, obviously it’s not a right, but a good or service. You do however have the right to sell your labor to the highest bidder so that you can go out and buy the best care. Additionally, that’s how we get the best advancements in medicine too, by incentivizing the best and brightest to become doctors. If you make health care a right, progress stops. Bernie’s an idiotCan someone give relevant links for climate change? Both sides just push it exists or it doesn&#39;t looking for raw data and how conclusions were reached. Bernie&#39;s reply of, &quot;I just listen to the scientist&quot; isn&#39;t really good enoughWait...<br /> Didn&#39;t Bernie  refuse to pay his campaign staff 15 hour? Where does he get off preaching about people paying 15 an hour when hes not willing to do it himself?<br /><br /> Why would Joe not push back on this?I don’t care what other people say. Get Trump on the podcast.Ask him about DMT JoeCrazy Bernie! Climate change is a hoax you lost me🍄Joe Rogan For President🍄I LOVE YOU GRANDPA BERNIEummm....all these democratic candidates should have at length answers and positions on line. it should be as easy as a couple clicks to find out anything. why they are NOT doing it is the questionDid anyone watch the dsa convention? Fucking cult like goofy ass shit going on.This dude starts right out the gate with the commie shit... Force the networks to give individual candidates air time?? Wtf<br /><br />And no matter how good it feels to say it healthcare is not a right. As long as someone is working for your provider or towards your healthcare in any way whatsoever, you don&#39;t have a right to their service. Why is that so hard for this idiot to understand that????<br /><br />And that annoying af voice...Incoming r/WallStreetBetsWow, a Democrat said something good about a police officer. But really, I agree with a lot that he says. Healthcare is ridiculous and education should be a lot cheaper than it is.Holy smokes!§ Bernie Sanders!!! Great guest to have on! Im gonna enjoy thisWhoa.I agree with very little he said but it was very interesting and valuable to hear his opinions in a longer, unedited format. Great videoGovernment has no right to take a gun that could save a family from a criminal who has one and wouldn’t follow any laws no way burnyWheres Ron Paul at?I think it&#39;s hilarius this guy changed his tune about the 1% after he was a part of that a illustrious group and then started going after the 1/10 of the 1%🤣🤣🤣🤣Less than 3 mins in and hes already started with how other countries do things. If you like it like that so much,go thereI can&#39;t watch anymore I know what socialism is! No thank you.! Control of money and people!  Please people don&#39;t vote for socialism! TRUMP 2020 WWG1WGA  America is great now!  Please don&#39;t fuck it up!I used to think Bernie was a crazy, old man because of how he always shouted in debates, but he seemed alright here.<br /><br /><br />Let&#39;s just fuck around and put Trump on here too. Let him speak his piece with a rational, mostly unbiased guy instead of MSM and see what occurs. We may be surprised!<br /><br />... Then again, we may not lol“Actually, I remember when...” insert relatable info. LmaoI love how Rogan brought up the UFO stuff at the last second, Bernie more or less said he would and Joe doubled down for a definitive answer.. xDWhether you like it or not.. You tax corporations more they will leave the country. That’s how this globalist age works. <br />Just like..Bernie’s $15 dollars an hour raise is getting people’s hours cut or fired.. wish it wasn’t true but most Bernie’s ideas we will feel the burn!If 99.99% of legal gun owners which make up at least half of the countries population wouldn&#39;t commit a mass murder, how is it the reality of our country that mass murder is a problem and guns are the issue? lmao I maintain taking guns away from democrats and you&#39;d prevent at least 90% of gun crime in the country...ALL gun crime...Hey Bernie, would you legalize DMT? That thing would rip your arms off!Joe didn’t ask this Commie about one of his “Bernie Bro’s” killing people in Ohio. This is just more bullshit Joe Rogan posts.To hear Bernie not shouting was refreshing. It probably was for him too.3 minutes and 20 seconds to the first mention of utilization of government force. Woo.I hate millionaire sorry burnHold the debates on CSPANTRUMP 2020The gun conversation is absolutely pathetic. Bernie has been a Politician for how long? And still doesn’t know the first thing about guns. Rifles of all types amount to 3% of total gun homicide in the us, AR 15s (not assault weapons because that’s a made up term) are a subset of that stat probably around 1%. THEY ARENT A PROBLEM ITS A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. Also the majority of mass shooting are with handguns anywaysas soon as he said legalize marijuana  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23votebernie2020">#votebernie2020</a>Joe R needs Tim Cast to ask them hard ???? All Joe R did was agree on almost everything Smh 🤦🏽‍♂️Tbh never listened to Bernie at all before but I&#39;ve always heard people talk bad about him but honestly he seems pretty fair and reasonable to meThis guy is unbearableSorry Rogan I will always think your a beast but I can’t stand Bernie and it pisses me off that you wanted to even do a podcast with himThis is how politics should be done. no yelling, no hashtags, no saying its the dems or repubs fault. just candidates explaining their viewsWow, Joe finally has an interdimensional alien on.BERNIE2020&quot;people think you&#39;re going to take their money&quot; &quot;that&#39;s unfair but... these people aren&#39;t giving me their money we need to take it!!!&quot;Thank you Joe. If you watch this &amp; still <b>hate</b> Bernie Sanders then look in the mirror &amp; ask yourself what kind of person you are 🤷‍♂️ these ideas work all over the world. He is running for all the right reasons unlike Republicans &amp; many Democrats. Bernie 2020 🔥Joe rogan..........andrew shultz...brilliant idiots cornell west....now bernie....boy do you have some pull.....best everDoes he even have the energy to be PresidentWhy are americans so dead set on owning so many guns? <br />Why are you all so afraid of attacks? what attacks... aliens or terrorists ? <br />The attacks you should be afraid of are the ones done right now in your country, the ones by your own people.<br />Attacks that are able to be done by just about anyone that can pose as -non insane-, <br />It saddens me as a belgian guy that victims of these attacks have to endure the retardness of american laws that make 0 sense.<br /><br />oh but we like weapons, its our right to own weapons.<br />Then you obviously don&#39;t mind walking the street knowing someone mentally ill will and can shoot you in the back, there goes your happy life owning guns.<br /><br />If you love hunting, buy a fucking bow.<br />or do it like other countries all around the world, make it so you need to have a license and a VERY INTENSE screening<br /><br />Not like this bernie sanders said; Did you beat your wife ? like what the fuck.<br />*ofc not sir.. why would i do that,<br />Walks out buys a gun and shoots himself, or someone else.<br /><br />You are living in a country that&#39;s insane, and run by mad men and still you don&#39;t voice yourselves.<br /><br />If this was something in europe people would protest untill guns are forbidden. it&#39;s a simple fact.<br /><br />/rant overFuck you Bernie!! By the way, your democratic socialists of America meeting was fucking awesome.break the internetAnyone who says he cares for the working man, and then says that the working man has no right to self preservation, or the right keep his wealth, is not one who cares for the working man.burntard more gov will fix everythingThis guy is president in an alternate universe.I can’t take no more of Trumps negativity and divisiveness, it’s exhausting. Time for a Change!Joe is really changing America. The fear factor comedian is the guy who will be remembered most from this era. He&#39;s the new tonight show only real life conversations.Sorry, but not one more inch. Gun owners rights have been getting trampled over for years now. Crazy is going to do crazy no matter what tool they use. Anyone out there can do harm with what ever they choose, and to The Bern, Assault Weapons are already extremely restricted.Bernie &quot;I&#39;ll nevuhh fuhhget&quot; SandersThere are a lot of fake right wing Russian trolls on here trying to sow conflict. DON&#39;T FEED THE TROLLS. That&#39;s exactly what the Kremlin wants you to do. Joe&#39;s audience is NOT 50% idiot mega-conservatives who are dumb enough to think Bernie is a communist. The ratio of anti-Bernie comments on here is way overblown, and it&#39;s pretty obvious why ^^^comrade Bernie.... &quot;ill tell you what to do with your money but ill drive an Audi A-8 and pocket shit tons of it for myself&quot;  lol  FUCK OFFThe first good guest this centrist has ever had.<b>Bernie deeply inhales</b><br /><br /><b>Me</b> grabs popcorn 😏GO BERNIE GO! I believe we need complete transparency of who is voting against this movement, I want to know who disagrees and their rationale behind it. 4K downvotes? Why? Are you for the corporate empire, or are you going to stand with the people?Bernie is so full of shit.   What a Pathetic LoserTalk to Tony Heller about climate change. He may change your mind.Bernie 2020<b>Voted for Trump in 2016, now i&#39;m all in for Bernie 2020. Trump is the swamp. Look at his cabinet. His policies disproportionately benefited the billionaire class, wall street, the military industrial complex, big pharma, and Zionists. He literally brought us to the brink of war with Iran. Trump was never a fighter for the working class. There is no 5-D chess. Trump is the establishment. Bernie and Yang are true progressives. I only like Bernie more because of his consistent track record and his positive systemic policies wouldn&#39;t be over turned by the billionaire class decades after his term is over.</b>Joe Rogan for President Eddie bravo for vice President and Alex Jones for Secretary.They admit there&#39;s a mental health problem, but wants to hurt the pharmaceutical companies that help these people?<br />Then than these people go on  mass-shooting sprees they blame the guns and the pharmaceutical drugs they where on?  And the only answer they can come up with is restricting human rights?<br /><br />Who TF wants to vote for this guy? He&#39;s a total contadiction.<br /><br />He&#39;s even wrong about Canada&#39;s healthcare system. Its the third worst medical system in the developed world.I think socialism in any form will ultimately cripple a country like America. But I have an increased respect for any candidate that agrees to sit across from Joe.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=11m55s">11:55</a> Bernie just broke the whole Elites and their scheme down right in front of your face👑OH FUCKING SHIT DAWG. For real though, the systematic failures of free-market capitalism can only be remedied through the expansion of socialist policies, and a political revolution that challenges mass inequality of wealth and power.Wow, Joe didn&#39;t push back on any of his nonsense. Lost whatever respect I had left for him after his first sit down with Jack.Socialism is great until you run out of others people moneyI love Bernie. He’s cool.Bernie I&#39;ll be waiting for that alien announcement, when you become president!👽Joe Rogan is Winning in 2019!! Lol<br />Very Dope having Bernie Sanders on<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieSanders2020">#BernieSanders2020</a>Does anything in America work? 😂<br /><br />It&#39;s the most backwards country in the world.Hey it&#39;s the guy I would have voted for.Instead of raising the wages just lower the taxes and make it so everyone keeps 75% of what they earn from income and tax the remaining 25%, if you make 30k you keep 75% of 30k if you make 1million you keep 75% of 1million seems like the most reasonable tax plan everyone is paying 25% and everyone keeps 75% of what they earn every year 😗👌This guy needs to go on the podcast againI love joe but he doesn’t know enough to challenge this demagogue. It’s child’s logic, all this sounds good but it doesn’t work and it’s completely Un american.Joe for president 👏🏻👏🏻I propose that Joe have a pod with Trump and the Dem candidate next year.Alright, it&#39;s official. He&#39;s male Oprah.Bernie Sanders is a communist.<br /><br />Joe Rohan needs to do his homework.<br /><br />I would have to pay more taxes, lose my employer based health insurance, pay for idiots who went to college because they were stupid and made a bad choice..... basically my qualities of life gets fucked, I make less money and it’s harder for me to crawl out of the poor life that I live.<br /><br />No thanks Bernie. <br /><br />Cut my fucking taxes, end regulations, get the fuck out of my way you stupid fucking commie. Let me get rich and after that, I don’t want your commie hands around my wealth. <br /><br />I hate this guy.who ever will tell us if aliens are real has my vote.Never give up your samurai swords! They want to disarm you! I&#39;m a responsible samurai sword owner. There&#39;s no way Bernie is taking my samurai sword.Whoa!OH MY GOOOOOD!!!! HE GOT BERNIE ON THE PODCAST HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!He&#39;s wrong, but I appreciate Joe giving him the time to fully explain what he&#39;s talking about.Did not expect this this morningWhy do dying Canadians flock to the U.S. if there system is so great Bernie???? We will all end up dying waiting in lines with his B.S.!!!Damn it, Bernie... At around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=33m45s">33:45</a> Bernie starts talking about five to ten million assault weapons that are military style and designed to kill human beings kind of rapidly. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The kind of rifles sold in America are not assault rifles, they are essentially extra large pistols that fire semi-automatically (one bullet per trigger pull, not one trigger pull and multiple bullets... for those of you that don&#39;t understand fully automatic vs semi-automatic) and you&#39;d be stupid to suggest that we should ban rifles that are far less concealable than hand guns. To further elaborate, the AR in AR-15 does NOT stand for assault rifle. It stands for the manufacture Armalite and Rifle... AR = Armalite Rifle. Military weapons are not sold to the public. Spreading this type of misinformation by either ignorance or deliberate intention is how you lose my vote. Know your topic!<br /><br /><br />You know what kills more innocent people per year than &quot;mass&quot; shootings ever had? Diarrhea! ...LOL. Drunk drivers kill more innocent people per year than mass shooters ever have and we still have cars and alcohol. The list of things that kill more people than these shootings is long. More people drown per year, but I don&#39;t hear anyone suggest we ban swimming pools and going in the ocean, either.<br /><br /><br />Guns aren&#39;t going away, so move on to the root cause of the outbursts. Even if you could eliminate guns or restrict the purchases, people will just move on to the next thing... because the root of the problem will still exist. Let&#39;s pretend guns are out of the equation... now people are blowing themselves up. Then what..? Ban everything that could be combined to create explosives? Ban fireworks? Ban cars &amp; trucks when people plow through a crowds? Ban 3D printers because people could print their own guns (remember the Liberator)? Is this really the direction we should be headed?<br /><br /><br />Work on the debt problems with high interest loans, barely living wages, crazy dividing politics, increasingly high cost of living and quality food then we&#39;ll see these outbursts fall. We also need more integrity in news organizations and less feeding off bullshit hyperbole &amp; click-bait that just get people worked up and turned against each other so they generate more ad revenue.Fuck you Bernie, we are a great nation. We have problems but we are still a great nation. You just spit in the face of my grandfather, father and myself all of whom made great sacrifice to ensure this is a great nation. I will not vote for someone who doesn&#39;t think America is great.Get Trump next!Trump is The GReATEST president whom ever lived ... peep dat!&quot;The DNC wants to give everyone a fair shot...&quot;   Yeah sure....             :)Trump should do that executive order on marijuana classification to spite Bernie.He says the government is corrupt  but talks about taking people’s guns away 🤔🤔🤔🤔Thanks Joe, for giving Bernie the opportunity to be heard by a community he might not have otherwise had the opportunity to. I hope they are listening and giving some consideration to what he has had to say.It would only be fare to have Donald trump nextBernie Sanders is my BartletJust because you spend money on something does not make it good. That seems to be his answer to better education.Bernie reasons his policies on what are seen as left-wing problems, but i would argue they are in truth something that even the hardest conservative would agree  on being at least an inconvenience; healthcare in US sucks, needlessly many people are dying because of deranged psychopaths with guns, etc, and we can also include the crappy education system which enslaves thousands of students in needless debt while at the same time spending billions on what are insignificant overseas threats for the US. Something needs to change, but this is where Bernie fails. No government policy is gonna fix our problems. We need to fix those problems, which are essentially our problems.<br />   People rely entirely on their &quot;elected&quot; politicians to take care of them, and yet ironically assert that freedom lies in their own hands. Bullshit! The current system cannot support us (and that goes also for the rest of the world). Status quo is as far from &quot;founding father America&quot; as North Korea is from democracy.<br /><br /><br />No Trump, No Bernie, No nobody apart from us ,as individuals first and society second, can get out of this mess by changing the way we think, feel and act.Bernie took a fat rip of that spliffPOLITICAL ADVERTISING ARE PROHIBITED ON TV OR RADIO!! In the run up to General Election (election campaign&#39;s last about 4 weeks between end of parliament and the new elected parliament) all political parties are instead given allocated broadcast slots on there policies and manifesto&#39;s, for free on National TV (BBC, ITV/STV/UTV, Channel 4, Five and S4C/TG4),  News Channels (BBC News/Sky News) &amp; National Radio (All BBC Radio Station) which are called &#39;Party Political Broadcasts&#39;!.<br />Here&#39;s the deal in the UK Political parties may be funded through membership fees, individual donations (a max of £7500 only either on a annual basis or to a campaign ) or state funding which used for admin costs.🧙‍♂️Bernie to joe- think back to 1965<br /><br />👴Joe thinking to himself- how old does this A-hole think I am  😂😂I really don’t like Bernie’s politics at all but before even watching this, I think everyone should respect the fact he’s willing to come onto joes podcast, can’t think of many other politicians that would do the sameMake this guy presidentJust a couple of corrections.<br />1. You will not be denied healthcare. If you walk into an ER with with a serious injury you will be treated. If you walk into the hospital with an illness you will be treated. <br />2. You do not need socialized healthcare to lower drug and health insurance prices. Congress has the power to that anytime. <br />3. America is not the only major country in the world without socialized healthcare and the fact of the matter is the reason we lead the world in medical research and quality of care is because our hospitals and medical schools generate revenue. <br /><br />I like Bernie in the sense that he is anti corporate corruption but socialism cannot and will not work in the US periodFirst thing out of his mouth what Yang&#39;s tagline at the end of the debate. SMHBernie/Tulsi 2020&quot;It is legal because they write the laws&quot; ...<br /><br />Did a guy who spent his life in Congress just say that? He has to be an Andy Kauffman type comedian, and this is a 40 year joke. <br /><br />Why do people still take this dunce serious? He did nothing about it. Got his book deals and summer homes tho. <br /><br />Bernie &quot;Socialism for thee, Capitalism for me&quot; Sanders.Smartest move from a Dem - has anyone else been on?profit is good, Bernie.I&#39;ve always said, all candidates should have a 60 Minutes like interview with a series of questions.Bernie&#39;s just a talking head.Great Interview Joe.   I may not agree with everything that Bernie says, but I respect his candor and he is honest about what he says.  He also isn&#39;t afraid to admit that  he doesn&#39;t know the answer, so respect to him.JESUS ROGAN! Do you not question anything he says???? Unsubbed.&quot;uuuuggghhhh I&#39;m gonna make it rain, America&quot;Whaaaaaat!!!!! Please right wingers, if you don&#39;t consider yourself a racist, listen with no bias and tell me you still hate him.Bernie is my guy... But he&#39;s not answering these &quot;how do we do it&quot; questions directly enough... And Joe feels off to me... It feels like his questions were vetted... or maybe he&#39;s just not comfortable... But I&#39;m only 20 mins in, so... We&#39;ll seeIf Bernie Sanders did take money from corporations, I would think it would be great for his campaign to take money from erection pill companies... With his age and all. 💊💊💊🌶This man is amazing. Was so excited to see him come on!  Only an hour though? C’mon Bernie campaign team!I&#39;m in for medicare for all through speculation tax.  He didn&#39;t sell me on the $15 minimum wage or free college.  Wish they talked about <br />immigration.I&#39;m in for medicare for all through speculation tax.  He didn&#39;t sell me on the $15 minimum wage or free college.  Wish they talked about <br />immigration.I&#39;m in for medicare for all through speculation tax.  He didn&#39;t sell me on the $15 minimum wage or free college.  Wish they talked about <br />immigration.I&#39;m in for medicare for all through speculation tax.  He didn&#39;t sell me on the $15 minimum wage or free college.  Wish they talked about <br />immigration.Love Bernie!Joe you leftists shillWe need these type of discussions.  Thank you.The thing about drug companies here in the US is that all the cutting edge drugs are developed here because it’s the most profitable to do it here. <br /><br />The governments that offer “free” medical care are benefiting off of American ingenuity and capitalism.Dude why is it so hard to say corporations that are X big or make X much money have the raise their min. wage, dont put a boot on the throats of a guy just starting a small service business. Wrong answer. They are radical ideas because theres no happy medium Bernie...Alot of small business owners starting out dont make anything or next to nothing it&#39;s hard enough as it is . . Starting a small business is true freedom and you&#39;re going to make that more difficult than it already is? You talk about Amazon but what about the small business owners? I&#39;m with Trump or YangWe in Britain all pay a TV licencing fee so the BBC can run, the BBC is basically a government run television channel but not really, it&#39;s meant to be owned by the people as they pay for it as a tax basically. So that&#39;s why party MPs and leaders can advertise themselves during an election as the house of commons/ the people own the BBC. Therefore that&#39;s why all main party&#39;s labour, conservatives, lib Dems etc have time to state their case. Just a brief summary and does not go over all the detailsBernie, you might have legit good intentions. But your math doesn&#39;t check.Burn some sage with Marianne WilliamsonHEY BERNIE <br /><br /><br /><br />How you paying for this? you really hate discussing money because that&#39;d require talking about doubling taxesFINALLY!!!Great talk.  But I&#39;m still waiting for someone to say PLUTOCRACY.Awesome&quot;You shouldn&#39;t even call them a debate. What they are is a... you know, reality TV show in which you have to come up with a soundbite and all that stuff.&quot;<br /><br />True words... first spoken by Andrew Yang. Longshot or not, Andrew Yang has influence. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>I love Bernie&#39;s morals/beliefs and think he truely is for the middle class. But someone needs to explain how economics work. It&#39;s no wonder everyone in the financial industry tends to be right leaning. Our system is definitely full of corruption but the raise minimum wage arguement is retarded. You&#39;re just going to add to inflation. It takes half of an economic lecture to know Bernie&#39;s ideas will not work... no matter how much enthusiasm there is. The US is the top 1% of the world. Think about that when you make these claims about how great other country&#39;s policies are.Ew his voice sounds so bad in the beginning... oh my godNot a chance <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MAGA">#MAGA</a> 2020!!Yeah,<br /><br /> we have 12 years until there&#39;s irreparable damage to the world from climate change.<br /><br />Why do these people talk as if nobody can go back and look at claims made in the past?<br /><br />In the seventies it was an ice age, then in the nineties it changed to the ozone layer and global warming, then in the early 2,000&#39;s Al Gore said in 10 years the sea levels will rise and there will be famines and it was going to be a major disaster.<br /><br />10 years came and went. No famines...no melted ice, theres more ice. Theres more polar bears, they are fine. <br /><br /> every major apocalyptic claim made by these people never came close to happening.<br /><br />Now they&#39;re saying 12 years or we&#39;re all going to die.<br /><br />How would you treat somebody if they stood on the corner with a sign and kept saying in 2 years we&#39;re all going to die if we don&#39;t do something, then the time comes and goes and nothing happens, and the person constantly crosses out the past statement and then writes a new date on the sign constantly pushing the date out over and over and over.<br /><br />Meanwhile, people are putting money in his jar the entire time while he keeps pushing the date out.<br /><br />Am I really the only one sitting here saying how absolute ridiculous and such bullshit it is with the constant doomsday claims with the global warming narrative, constantly getting grants and asking for money and constantly making outrageous claims about the world ending that never comes close to happening in any way shape or form?<br /><br />If you can&#39;t go back and look at the scam that this has been for the last 4 decades, then you are absolutely willfully naive and ignorant.Better watch out when someone says you know the truth is your going to get BS capitalism is greatI can&#39;t watch him, Joe.<br /><br />Thank God you triedGet trump on!<b>Sanders/Rogan2o2o</b> 🌎🕊Tulsi gabbard was here first just sayingThe debates aren’t the issue- the number of candidates are.Bernie’s a far right white supremacist fascist now that he’s been on Joe RoganStraight dope. Sanders doesn&#39;t lie. Answered every question on point. RESPECT.Please have a conservative on such as Andrew wilckow to respond to thisGreat of Rogan to do this, and for Bernie to be on.<br />And this is nothing against Joe, BUT, seeing how many dislikes are on this video, he shouldn&#39;t be surprised when some people call him a Right-winger, because he doesn&#39;t have a massive Right-wing audience for nothing.HO-LE-CHITJoe interview all the candidates!Oh you crazy old coot. 😭 Sad.Is Bernie in the yang gang??People don’t like Bernie Sanders because they’re afraid of having genuine control over their livesOur next President! Bernie/Yang 2020!!!Bernie 2020!!!!Having great ideas with absolutely no known way to implement them is classic Bernie.I&#39;d like to physically harm every commie here.God bless Bernie from the UKCan i buy a weapon capable of burst fire? Of going full auto? No. We have RIFLES. not assault rifles. Jesus, this infuriates me to no end.Well this was unexpectedFuck this old commie motherfuckerWow very impressive that Joe got Bernie Sanders on the podcast!&quot;Healthcare as a human right&quot;<br />Your rights are what you have left when you are not interfered with or unjustly interfering with others.<br /><br />If you are on a desert island alone, you have the right to free speech, you have the right to self defense, you have the right to be secure in your possessions. You don&#39;t have the right to healthcare. If another person landed on that island, you forcing him to provide &quot;healthcare&quot; for &quot;free&quot; would be violating his rights.<br /><br /><br />The state, government, cannot provide rights, it can only violate them.Bernie Sanders, I told my family you had a conversation with Joe Rogan. 402 days until you are President of the United States.What a radical. DislikeEven Wapo fact checked his lies on health care... If you support this guy you are a hipster retard, plain and simple.Worst guest ever. Free shit Sanders is a lying turd.Fuck this small hatKinda wanted to see bernie hit a fat bluntThank you for this.ask him why the housing crisis happened. ask him why he supported attacking libya and syria (he blamed the syrian conflict on climate change) amazon pays like a hundred billion dollars in taxes, they also provide a ton of services to the government directly. this guy is just stupid talking points in rotting costume.Now TrumpI am very disappointed about you Joe, I don’t know if you are biased but you did not put him on the spot. Nothing is free go to every single country even Danmark and Sweden, it is not free and of course welfare is a privilege. Canada has a population of ca 38 million people, Danmark has 5,7. Joe don’t be so trusting he is a politician, they cannot be trusted, after all your conversations you haven’t learned to check what people say. I know you are a smart and empathetic person but it saddens me to see that you do not put a Socialist on the spot.Im not American. I think because you guys have state level laws the top states with most drug problem could legalize all drugs and then see what happens. It should take the money away from drug lords and cartels and the state could reuse that money to try to rehblelite people Who get mostly affectedHe has zero real ways to do what he says he&#39;s gonna do... joe it&#39;s not that we dont like using the term assault weapons, it&#39;s that it is a vague term that tricks uneducated citizens. That term gives the idea that it&#39;s a full auto weapon, but it isnt. The gun discussion was pure uneducated propaganda. The amount of mass shootings quoted is not corroborated by anyone. This point alone is enough for me to say no to this, for God&#39;s sake you&#39;re a gun owner joeBernie  Sander for US president and US will be one the greatest country. Don&#39;t trust those one who sale you health care for investors huge profit!If Bernie gets elected and the senate goes democrat, we will still have a zionist warmonger for senate leader.Why are you promoting this communist?Joe, brother w/jiujitsu, just ponder the thought of reaching out to POTUS Trump and give home your amazing platform.WTFYour Top number one historical interview Mr. Joe Rogan   { Bernie is the real deal with the movement will be reality }Bernie is impending doom.That pinko commie can eat my whole ass. Take my guns and I&#39;ll give you the bullets first.Bernie isn’t the answer. The dudes running the same party that literally screwed him in 2016. Fool me once?Behold, the only candidate that actually cares about everyone.🔥🔥🔥Gun owners have already made a fuck ton of &quot;concessions&quot;.  We barely have a second amendment anymore compared to its original vision.   Depriving law abiding citizens of their rights is a slippery fuckin slope that DOES. NOT. END.  Case in point Britain seriously considering making pointed knives illegal.I thought I was a Bernie supporter but I&#39;m 3 minutes in and it sounds like he&#39;s advocating network slavery.Ol crazy uncle bernie.. btw assualt weapons defined by the federal law its an action of the weapon not the style.. do more damage with a 12ga. Pump With 000buckshotI swear Bernie is a hologramThank you Joe!Absolute bull crap on the quality of medical care being better in Canada than in the United States.  Unchallenged statements sometimes sound great until they are met with facts.  That didn&#39;t happen in this case.joe had to ask about aliens lmaoBernie, ever try DMT?Please get Mayor Pete!All civilian bought guns should be forcibly manufactured to be SOLID HOT PINK. Every single gun, no exceptions. If you are caught painting them black, you will have them confiscated.Holy shit, Bernie realized he could address millions of people thanks to Joe, smart moveIm not a Bernie fan. After watching this i can see why people like him and after hearing his ideas expanded upon i think hes far worse than i originally thought.Sorry Joe, this makes me sick that you would bring a hypocritical socialist maggot on to your show.  Fucking eh!  AND THIS IS NOT A KNEE JERK REACTION POST....IT&#39;S FUCKING TRUE.  This piece of shit that has never produced or worked for a fucking thing in his life and has no problem redistributing the income of hard working people.  He is a multi millionaire on taxpayer money - let that sink in.  PATHETIC!This video lasted only 1 hour hahahaha Bernie Bernie Bernie. You old fart.Raise wages ? Everything else gets raised...back to square 1Bernie&#39;s a dustbowl.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=46m00s">46:00</a> the most important question!Nice!Is this really BernieBernie, straw man purchases are a crime, Joe, you got to call these people out. especially when in comes to guns. There is already an assault weapon ban. Come on Joe!An hour of serious social and political questions..... ALIENS. <br /><br />GIVING THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!Now how many politicians are willing to sit down and be this open with questions. You just gained a lot more respect from me. 👍🏼Where was the discussion about the corruption of the primaries in 2016? What about the new car and vacaction home acquired after the primaries all of a sudden, <br /><br />Semi-automatic rifles are sold to civilians not assault weapons that the same thing the military uses to any capacity and fully automatic weapons have not been legal for civilian ownership since 1934.  So just because the outside of a gun looks different than a hunting rifle that makes it somehow worse?<br /><br />Since when were factory working jobs good paying jobs? Those factories screwed over the workers and had them working in substandard conditions with terrible wages.  Some factories would pay in “Company Scripts” that you could only use at factory stores, and were worth less than the value of the dollar, furthering poverty for these people.  On top of that if the production worker costs rose for these companies, what are we going to pay $500 for a Mr Coffee now just because it was made here?  Lower corporation taxes and incentive starting businesses so people start to build businesses again.  <br /><br />I like Bernie’s stance on marijuana, prison, and investing in our young people, but there was a whole lot of pandering and emotion striking language used here to say what people want to hear.  Not to mention, for someone concerned about time restraints in debates, I think this was the shortest JRE I’ve seen.  We can also add the fact that Bernie has had a pretty bad track record in passing legislation as a senator, plus he openly ran on a socialist platform in previous elections.  <br /><br />Some good stuff here, but a lot of unanswered questions.Wow this is Yuuge!Listen to &quot;The Strangest Secret&quot; by Earl Nightingale, then listen to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. I bet you won&#39;t last more than 5 minutes before you start to pull your hair out. They don&#39;t believe in personal responsibility, or plan to exploit the people who don&#39;t want to be held responsible for their choices.Why Joe? Bernie is a total loser.Hell yeah Americas dad on JRE!Joe should host long form debates with small panels of candidatesBernie is fucking garbage. If he were president he would financially ruin us the way his WIFE financially ruined the college she was president of....after she obtained a loan via Bernie&#39;s threats to the bank. Grade A piece of shit.I love Bernie! but my vote is going to Andrew Yang this go-round.OH SHIT!He is disconnected from reality. I want him to be President so all these ridiculous ideas can be mocked and buried.Bernie Sanders is America’s DadI love the way Bernie’s head is hanging&lt;3More jobs for African Americans, Mexican Americans , then ever before. The country is doing the best ever.I’m sure free medical care, college, etc... will benefit all the dead people where communism/socialism has been tried before<br /><br />USSR<br />China<br />Cuba<br />Venezuela <br /><br />You see in all these places it starts out with free stuff but ends with gulags and death.  100,000,000+ people died with a promise but that’s all they ever received.<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/1lTGu35BpZs">https://youtu.be/1lTGu35BpZs</a>Mass shootings I tell you what the problem is back in the day my grandpa used to carry Dynamite the school to clear stumps out of the field he was brought up right not to blow up the f*<b>***</b> school it&#39;s all about your upcoming your upbringing<br />You got all these scallywag snowflake parents having children they have no idea how to raise a child<br />You f*** a child up logically in their head they&#39;re going to mess up the world they&#39;re going to find a gun and they&#39;re going to destroy some stuff<br />Is the parents fault for f*<b>***</b> him up in the head<br />I bet if they put every parent Behind Bars and every parent&#39;s parent Behind Bars they did some crazy s*** they would make damn sure they raise their child right or put them in an insta tution is there a born that way crazyOnly one hour? This has gotta be one of the shortest episodes of this show.I’d never vote for this old socialist. However, thanks to Joe for having him on and having an unfiltered convo with yet another presidential candidate 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻all of these antics hes proposing will drive all american companies out of the US and there will be less and less jobsStarts interview with complaining about the short time fragments for debating and discussing serious issues. Only spends 1 hour at Joe.As a Canadian it is not true that you can go to whatever doctor you want.... You can go to emergency rooms yes, You cannot however go to any family, specialist etc of your choice... You need to be approved and allowed into one which is a very rare accommodation at the moment and many people cannot get into a family doctor because they are all full in my town, a year plus waiting list.He is either a pathological dishonest person or he has a lack of knowledge about the real world, which I doubt ...Hopefully they smoked weed togetherThe Grapes of Bernie.(((Telivision))) rules the nation..<br />Around the world 🌎Yes he&#39;s a good talker but TRUMP is the man for 2020!!I got to say if Bernie makes to the end against Trump is gonna be thunderdome in DC. Lol.<br />Really really smart for Bernie to come and speak in Joes show, I think this might get him a presidential seat.oh nooooooHey Bernie take a hit offa this jointA reasoned and logical thinker, what a rare and refreshing thing (not just because i agree with some things he says). Here in the UK our National Health Service is the pride of the nation, it’s the one thing the people will unite to defend.You really want to fix the health care issues?? Get the fucking lobbyist out of OUR government! And now you want government to foot the bill to companies that would love nothing more then to have a big government paycheck for a fucking Tylenol! The government spends stupid amounts of money on giving hampsters boners, you really don&#39;t think they&#39;d spend stupid amounts of money, especially when the companies are setting the price??Soooooo Bernie... you ever try DMT?Three down let&#39;s see who else has the stones to talk to joe and actually begin to have real conversation than just soundbites<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=37m36s">37:36</a> laughs in rice farmerBernie. 0 understanding on economics. Thts the main reason why he doesnt have my vote.What will Bernie do when Hillary anounces she&#39;s running in 2020??Honestly I usually cant get threw the full 2 hours I&#39;ll skip around and end early but i love hear political agenda not only do the politicians have to back up their claims but you could fact check them even debate them in ways TV never will I bet If you can get the majority of Democrat candidates you could get trump XDBernie going to fix:<br />1. Education<br />2. Energy<br />3. Healthcare <br />4. Housing<br />5. Student loans<br />6. And everyone gets a unicornHow much influence did Cornel West have on Joe in booking Bernie?Grand Solar Minimum has nothin to do with coal and fuckin cow farts you Librards!!!!! Get a real job!At least he got his word out. But, not one question about his workers walking out on him. No words about how cnn is definitely censoring his supporters and propping up Pocahontas Warren. Short episode I get it. But I can’t vote for someone based on only positive vibes of what they’d do. Tulsi has my vote cause she’s let it all out.What the fuck joe1 hour of 12 second  soundbytesJoe constantly goes easy on guest&#39;s who are left leaning and allways drilling the right.&quot;Get Mitch on the show.&quot; That turtle mfer wouldn&#39;t go on any show where they don&#39;t blow him and the corporations he represents.Joe, I&#39;m going to have to call you a pussy for not calling him out for calling an assault rifle a military style rifle...we all know that&#39;s not true and thanks to you, these dumb cunts are going to keep lying to the American people because they got away with it on your show where you&#39;re supposed to be a voice of freedom per your words (unless of course you&#39;ve been lying to us all as well).Joe should moderate the presidential debates.I was waiting the whole time during that gun debate for him to mention this from his previous podcast and he didn’t. Colin Noir brought up the point the statistics show in areas that allow open carry that gun violence is LESS. Allowing the average normal citizen to concealed carry can be a deterrent to the crazy assholes who would do a thing like that. New gun control laws??? Come one lunatics don’t care about the law <br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/T8eea1pgrBM">https://youtu.be/T8eea1pgrBM</a>Bernie is a hoax if he believes the IPCC crap.Bernie is a hoax if he believes the IPCC crap.15 minutes in and joe sounds like an undercover right wing reporter.<br />Typical Yankee fox bollocksBernie always gestures with his hands like he&#39;s trying to stop an argument at a dinner tableCool, but how the hell hasnt Dave Chapelle been on yet?I believe in Bernie, but he needs to realise the system he&#39;s going up against. How can he possibly just slap a tax on wall street, or make any of the other changes he suggested? He&#39;ll be taking down entire industries. The same rich and powerful people he talks about won&#39;t let it happen. You can&#39;t fix a greedy system when everyone is greedy, because the system is only the sum of it&#39;s parts. People need to change, there needs to be some sort of public revolution against mega-capitalism, or at least some sort of incentivisation for the rich and powerful to cease pillaging society. On top of that, the government needs to be become completely altruistic and not subject to the same greed that corporate lobbyists currently satisfy. Any less support than that and Sanders is likely to be JFK&#39;d. It really is more than just a matter of electing Bernie.Who is going to pay for all the free shit you are talking about ???<br />The working peoples money.I was naive and  suppoerted Bernie in 2016 -- I&#39;ve been Red Pilled and now I&#39;m voting Trump 2020None of these Democratic socialists have ever implemented any socialist paradise in any of their jurisdictions that they have had power in for over 30 years.  California and New York are total disasters.  California has the worst economic and racial inequality and stratification in the United States.Bernie essentially wants everyone on the same financial playing field... This will halt innovation and desire to rise higher because you will be paying more in taxes the harder you work.NO SHIT.  BERNIE ON JOEThe guy is just trying to sound good obviously. Canada HAS better healthcare.Combating poverty and general decriminalization would have huge tertiary effects towards reducing gun violence and mental health issues. Too many people are killed, incarcerated, losing their families and livelihoods over nonviolent and petty offenses. This is especially true for black men but they aren&#39;t the ones committing the mass shootings, it&#39;s almost always a white, Christian, male, conservative (see GAO-17-300). When people see a future for themselves, they will be more resilient to self destructive behaviors. When two jobs still will not pay the bills and the hole just keeps getting deeper, people stop trying to survive and start trying to escape their doomed reality.Me: <b>sees thumbnail</b><br /><br /><b>drops baby on floor and watches video</b>Bernie likes to throw the word &quot;free&quot; around quite a bit.  Interesting idea that so many things in life can be free.  If only that were the caseHe doesnt have any fuckin answers. Full of shit politician with no answers.Joe Rogan won&#39;t have Milo, Gavin Mcinnes or Stefan Molyneux back on because they&#39;re too extreme. But he will have on a multimillionaire that didn&#39;t work a day til his mid 40s and has the same economic policy that crippled countries like Venezuela and has never worked once. Rogan is a shillAutomatic thumbs down for giving a full blown communist a platform.With the exception of Bernie, Tulsi, and a few others, our system of representative government is clearly working for the corporate interests of our nation and not for our, or our nation’s well being. When the hell are people going to notice that? Is it the pills? Media propaganda? When?!!<br />Bernie 2020!I give Joe credit because it seem slike he is honestly trying to learn.  By judging these comments we can see many of his viewers are very different.  They can not break away from their corporate indoctrination.  <br /><br /><br />They literally think Big Government is the root of all evil, while missing the fact that corporate power has run our government unchecked for decades.  Private power needs to be held as accountable as government power.  By definition corporations are organized with a tyrannical power structure.  Representational government is a necessary check to that power.Not a Bernie supporter but I’m happy and excited to be able to hear him speak on JRE, I feel Joe tends to be more honest and ask the right questions (most times). The media tends to bash Bernie almost as much as Trump, so this is refreshing!It&#39;s a good thing that the huge majority of young people who support Bernie Sanders don&#39;t vote..I&#39;m actually not going to bother with this s***. Carry-on Joe but carry on without me.I like his policiesSo this just happenedBernie doesn’t say that without the profit incentive of U.S. big Pharma new drugs wouldn’t be developedCrazy B in the houseTomorrow he’ll have Kim jong unhell yeah, what a surpriseAnyone who actually pays attention in America supports BernieAll the money the companies aren’t paying in taxes are going into these politicians’ pockets. Don’t believe a word he says.This is what i love about this podcast. I don&#39;t follow politics a lot but with this kind of format I get a rough idea of what Bernie&#39;s stances are on all these different subjects (if he&#39;s being honest and direct about it). Instead of stupid debates on tv or clickbait articles online.Joe: &quot;Bernie, if you were in a fight with a chimpanzee would you use strikes or use your ground game?&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=6m00s">6:00</a> BULL SHIT!!!!!! I was a Canadian citizen  and he is full of shit with this statement,,boring......The country will be a much better place when this MFer is dead and gone. This guy is almost totally full of shit or oblivious. Yeah. Nothing revolutionary here. Hahahahaha. This reminds me of a little girl (Joe Rogan) mesmerized by her old cuddly uncle tell a fairytale story about fairyland. Bernie World and Fairyland have the same amount of validity. Complete nonsense.Y’all, my life is complete. Theo has Coach Brown on, now Joe has Bernie. I was a republican until Trump got elected now I’ve changed parties. Go Bernie!Joe snuck in the UFO question at the end😂😂😂Communist scum!  Go jump off a bridgeMy uncles social security is being garnished right now over medical bills.  He&#39;s a veteran but the VA sucks.I never clicked on something so fast<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m37s">1:04:37</a> According to Bernie we fought WWII against the Chinese.EVERYTHINGS FREE!!!It still amazes me being from the Uk that the US still don’t have free health careDamnit! 8 minutes in a bernie has spewed nothing but lies about healthcare and Joe just gobbles it up. This is the Jack Dorsey interview all over again. <br /><br />Bernie &quot; I want to completely socialize healthcare in 4 years&quot;<br /><br />Joe &quot;that doesn&#39;t seem radical at all&quot;....Fuck Joe I wanna punch you in the face with my dick mr waste high midget mother fuckerJoe. <br /><br />Sincerely, thank you for doing what you do. You deserve recognition for hosting these conversations because what you are doing is bringing the brains of these titans of industry to the table and letting the world pick them to fully understand them. Your work is enormously more important than most people probably realize.<br /><br />Please never stop doing this. I’m not joking.Knee jerk conservative?  Plenty of Dems aren&#39;t fans of ol rich Bernie. Canadian healthcare sucks.  Waiting periods of months for important surgery etc.  Bernie never talks serious math about insuring 330,000,000 people.ya wait 30 days for heart surgery my ass. fuck off Bernie. if i have heart surgery you bet your fucking ass im going to america to get it done in 4 days.heart surgery is fucking major and most people cant wait 30 fucking days...&quot;Okay but does your free healthcare for all also provide free DMT for all?&quot;   <br /><br />&quot;Does your healthcare plan cover orangutans who hurt themselves while spear fishing?   Also, did you know orangutans have taught themselves how to spear fish?   Do you think that an orangutan on DMT would catch more fish or less fish?&quot;I love that Bernie is on this podcast of all podcastsYes joe! 42.50😎🍺👍🏼👍🏼Yet the radical left will STILL claim Joe Rogan is a prOMotInG RiGht WiNGerSTyranny marches on! Left! Right! Left! Right! Thanks for exposing everyone&#39;s agenda Joe! Hopefully people are listening!We gotta take the power back! Yeah we gotta take the power back! -RATMDonald Trump is next, I bet.Joe &quot;yea man&quot; RoganJoe and Bernie agreeing to announce alien existence on air if confirmed may have just won him the race haha!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=3m14s">3:14</a> Wants legislation to give the government control of allocation of news time.<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=6m05s">6:05</a> canadian healthcare waits are hundreds of times longer than America. And our quality of care is drastically better. <br /><br /><br />Foreign governments spend about as much to get democrat candidates elected.<br /><br /><br />And the path to power for EVERY socialist dictator began by vilifying private industries.Dang, This should of been 2 hoursWheres trumpY&#39;all are so stupid,  move out the country if u like dumb shit. But your still here huh? Capitalism!!! Is y ur LA  can think like a fool and get away with itif you really dont agree with at least some of bernie&#39;s ideas, you&#39;re retarded<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TermLimits">#TermLimits</a>Put him and Alex jones on the same podcastCan you get Trump on the show??????THE SECOND AMMENDMENT IS NOT FOR HUNTINGWow..... America is one fucked up place... from Australia, thank god I don’t live there.. Australia is rooting for you Bernie. Cmon!!Get Tulsi, she&#39;s pretty hotUncle Joe got Bernie! Hot damn!Bernie said we won the war against the Chinese and the Nazi&#39;s I thought he was alive back then he sure it wasn&#39;t the Japanese?Have Ron Paul on so you can see and hear a more intellectual thinker not a victimologistYeah Will Bernie kind of Dodge the question about the cartel and the drug flow that&#39;s coming into the southern border. He just said that well we need to make people happier to make them not want to do drugs. Well the addiction seed has been planted already and now you got to deal with that so cold turkey the country cut off the supply of drugs coming in here.I see you Joe. Don&#39;t like Bernie, but I see youJoe should have Thomas Sowell on tomorrow so he can debunk this commie&#39;s nonsense.The FDA prevents any kind of competition in the pharmaceutical industry.Muthapuckin Berni Sanders on jreJesus Joe could you suck a smaller dick here? Hes not even looking at you 95% of the time hes reciting points and your not even asking for correlationIs it just me or is Bernie eye stalking that note pad to the right of him?Bernie..... 10 seconds in and he’s calling the BS of the debates. Good man Bernie. Still think you’re a dumb ass. But good shit.Bernie is still wrongSorry Joe, you just said an outright lie. There aren&#39;t &quot;hundreds of mass shootings a year&quot;. There have been 113 mass shootings in the US since the 1980s. 95% of them have been committed with pistols or shotguns. Check mother Jones, a super left wing publication which confirms all of them. Btw, the majority of mass shooters aren&#39;t white, again by mother Jones which is an anti-white organization. Stop spewing lies.I feel like Bernie could’ve did betterJoe may be doing the most work to educate and inform the public than ANY other outlet we currently have....Joe Rogan, you are doing great work here. I love that you are working through the candidates and giving them all the opportunity to really say what they want to say while asking them the important questions. Your 2 Tulsi episodes are so fucking good. Glad your show exists Joe. This is great and important stuff.How come Joe didn&#39;t whip a joint out on Bernie???I don&#39;t really agree with his policies or his stance and a lot of issues but I really do appreciate hearing everything he actually has to say about these issues that we are facing today I appreciate Joe going about it in a very civil manner even though he wasn&#39;t really the biggest fan of Sanders. I love to see some type of debate with some of the candidates or at least three of them on this show  for 5-hour hour debate just with three people. Preferably Tulsi and yang and possibly Biden. As Yang said not left not right but forward let&#39;s see if we can make that happen!Shhhhhhhhhhhh.. Trying to watch the guys under me on the screen above.he sounds like he knows what hes talking about but so did Castro, Maduro, Chavez,hitler and we know what happened there.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=6m23s">6:23</a> Canadians don&#39;t have this. We don&#39;t get dental, hearing or optical for free. We also still have to pay for all our drugsHow did Joe Rogan managed to pull this off??Get Trump on this showBernie is a socialist fuck.. we don’t need your rhetoric or you to waste time your time in 2020Chew on this, if other people didn’t have military style guns then you wouldn’t need military style guns to protect your self from them, I have 3 guns myself, they are for hunting, not hunting people, if you think it’s cool to have a badass ar 15, your neighbor might think it’s cool to beat your door down and take his anger out with his ar15 on your parents, wife, and kids, if you didn’t have one, he wouldn’t either and he just might kill u before you get the chance to grab itI&#39;ve of course always heard of Bernie, but I could never &quot;get to know him&quot; in the way I did watching this one hour.  Joe&#39;s bang on: these long-form political discussions are simply integral to the process.  No wonder why Yang and Tulsi have been rewarded for their courage to participate in such discourse.One hour show?  Joe typically gives everyone 3 hours on average. So I assume they talked for 2 hours before going live about what they can and cannot talk about.Tulsi Gabbard for PresidentBernie can’t handle the Drug questions. He tries to reform the question to a easily answered question. I get it, he has to be PC because their is a lot of people still brainwashed to think that arrest stop drugs. You can not stop this violence and opiate epidemic without legalizing all substances. I do think fixing the health care system will relieve a lot. Though it won’t fix the black market and murder. The black market exists only because it’s illegal. Also the big pharma profits more than anyone. They have the big monopoly on peddling heroin.Careful joe, don’t break the internet just yet.I hate that joe doesn&#39;t press him on any of this stuff. It would have been a good opportunity for him to talk to him like he talks to his peers. Challenging them on ideas he thinks wont work.He thinks post-secondary education is more expensive because subsidies were cut?<br /><br />Sweet Jesus does this guy care about the price of post-secondary?  Even a little?  How in the <b>**</b> does a guy talk about this for years without getting curious about where the higher costs are coming from and where the money is going?Remember when one salary was enough to support the whole family? Will that ever happen again and who is raising the kids when the adults have at least 2 jobs.I love you Bernie!Literally got an ad for antidepressants right in the middle of their talk about big pharmaYooo Bernie 2020!!!I will never understand how people decide to dislike JRE vids. Whats the thought process? was it joe? you dislike the guest? I end up checking the comments and just seeing memes then watching the entire thing.Joe has Larry David on and doesn&#39;t ask him how much he hates jerry Seinfeld! Smh come on joe ask the serious questions!Joe Reading off the Question sheet, to put to the Old Fart, Given to him by Donna Brazile before the mics went hot! And Jamie couldn&#39;t pull anything up, as a CIA agent had a loaded handgun jammed up to his temple!!!Vermont is NOT like the rest of the USA.  Vermonter here, Bernie used to come to my kindergarden class &amp; read the spooky old tree.  Vermont is culturally bland...FACT: health care is a human rightTypical liberal, full of ideas with no idea how to implementHow about we fix the k threw 12 education first we all know it&#39;s bullshitI still like Yang and Gabbard more than Burnie, but I&#39;d still vote for him.  Joe should host a debate in the studio, it would be a lot better than that CNN and MSNBC bullshitThank you Joe for bringing on this deranged old man who clearly hasnt a clue. He loves skirting questions. Never answered the 15 min wage will make businesses close the door. I&#39;m no longer a bernie bro. He should have stuck to 45 second sound bites...makes him sound betterGod damn Joe you outdid yourself. Good job mate!Vote for me and I’ll use the govt to give you free shit and higher wages! <br /><br />Just don’t look under the hood and take a close look at the actual economic impact these proposals would have. <br /><br />The demonization of private companies will literally be the downfall of this country because it would justify the confiscation of any and all private wealth on the basis of “unfair.” How about decrease the amount politics can impact businesses or the free market and they will stop lobbying! Crony capitalism is just as dangerous as socialismwell ..... in a little more than an hour Bernie has spent more than 100 trillion dollarsI farted probablyIf you got Trump on here that&#39;d be incredible.. but kudos for getting so many candidates on as it is<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m20s">23:20</a> 😎I&#39;m not a Sanders fan, but you gotta give it to Joe. It&#39;s good to see people hold a normal conversation.&quot;If it don&#39;t make money, it don&#39;t make sense.&quot; - American Government&quot;Never trust a socialist with a summer house &quot; - Colin Quinn&quot;Ordanary people who are getting a masters degree..&quot; love you Bernie..... but those aren&#39;t your average Joe 😉Love joe he ask about the aliens at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂 lolHe’s not even from Vermont! This guy n his wife are a fraud!Haha the fossilized far-left bulldog visits Joe Rogan&#39;s den. Nice one mate 👌🏽This is one of the best moments in history this is what I live for. For the first time I’ll vote because I believe we should all come together!Let&#39;s save 3 trillion dollars by dissolving the federal government..We won&#39;t ever give up our guns, sorry Bernie.nice of you to have him on the showJoe talks to a communist racist.Ive been waiting for thisAgenderSo Bernie is quite as crazy as he seems. Now you need to have Trump on to tell the other sideForcing media companies  to give candidates  airtime is theft. First mention of theft happens within 4 minsTrump 2020I really want to &quot;democratic socialism&quot; win in America, so they realize how &quot;great&quot; is and how &quot;fair&quot; is... I really hopeThat nigga BernieBernie &quot;Let&#39;s give away free things and tax people who know how to evade paying taxes&quot; Sanders. <br /><br />The wealthy have evaded paying taxes in every society. In all the major European nations which provide &quot;free&quot; services, the majority of it is paid for by the middle class who use it. <br /><br />All of Bernie&#39;s ideas will ensure a tiny middle class, a small wealthy class, and a massive amount of people in the lower classes.If he has Trump on here it will break the internet.10.22 : is He saying a private company can´t charge you any price they want and that you have to sit down with this companies and tell them what the price should be by looking at their costs ? I don´t think economy work that way, except in socialism....putting a limit to the influence of private companies on politics by lobbying can be reasonable, creating public hospitals financed with taxes, can also be reasonable, but telling companies how much the price of their product should be, I don´t think soThis was epic, Bernie was awesome!!BERNIE!!The future is fucking weird, fear factor dude interviews a serious presidential candidate on youtube. Whatever, I&#39;m down.Bernie Sanders on Joe Rogan? Today is my lucky day. Finally we get this champion for the working-class on the podcast.Can’t stand this voice&quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.&quot;<br /><br />-The Last American PresidentLove this !!! The problem with Bernie is he makes waaaayyyyy too much sense. America is a profoundly dumb country. Anything that makes too much sense is immediately rejected. All by design. Starts with piss poor eduction system. Keep the masses ignorant and control them.Ross Perot was a smart Mother Fucker.<br />It was the Liberal media that made him out to be a crazy person.<br />Like they are still doing today.Joe sold his soul and is a shillPlease get Marianne Williamson on the podcast Joe!wow bernie hunchbag is making sleepy man , why are communists so boring ?Bernie is so senile he can&#39;t even look Joe in the eyes and has to read from some script on the table...Even then he says uhh and is extremely vague and can&#39;t bring up examples but just references things about &quot;cuz this reputable guy says so!&quot; What a joke, huge mistake coming on here LOL. Get John McAfee on here.!I cant wait to see all the dislikes from the reactionary morons who probably wont even listen to the podcastNo pushback from joe on any topics so far and Bernie is incorrect on his gun “facts”. This is pretty painful to listen to at most parts. Joe didn’t even offer him weed when it came up, wtf Joe?Joe Rogan you&#39;re killing meBernie Sanders doesn’t have all the answers. <br /><br />But from what I’ve seen he’s the only leader that is willing to tell you the truth. The truth is we don’t run this country, Billionaires do. They make all the laws, they make the slave wages, you are nothing to them but a future corpse.I&#39;m just hoping they smoke up!&quot;You really want violent extortion for X&quot;<br />-Bernie<br /><br />&quot;If I really wanted X I would be willing to pay for it&quot;<br />-meThis interview was the biggest waste of time. Cannot bring myself to finish it. He responds to every single question in the same manner. The top 1% and the bottom 90 something %, Medicare for all none sense and a livable wage. Who is this guy kidding?Poor Bernie.  Spent all that time saying what was wrong with America, and couldn&#39;t give Joe a single solution for any of them.   Platitudes, nothing but platitudes.  And no, raising the minimum wage is NOT a solution for anything.This guy talking bout real problems not like Trump talking bout a Wall. The rich get richer and the poor stay poor.Don’t really alight with his political stance, but really enjoyed hearing him articulate his viewpoints. Seems like a stand up guy.Bernie Sanders. The ClownAppreciate you bringing up the issues long form but I feel you went a little easy on him. Maybe have him and Shapiro on at the same time 😂I would of liked to hear him on immigration..Joe is such a right winger, he let the likes of Bernie Sanders on his podcast! EXPOSED!!!He sounds like a politician, dodging questions. You Dems are screwed!!!Evil corporations somehow kidnaped our iPhones and won’t give them to us instead of making our iPhones. socialists lolI would like to see Mayor Pete as a guest.He&#39;s got access to the alien files.... anybody who says &quot;honestly&quot; before answering, easy tell...Do the Bernie leanLook how many right wingers joe hasI feel like Bernie is a good guy, but we have nothing in common and id never vote for him. I don’t think it’s possible for liberals to have that mindset about conservativesGet trump on.What a great surprise! Very much appreciatedBernie 2020 💙Hope he lets some republicans on, he should host some debates!!!  Oh, and Bernie should educate himself on firearmsSo I&#39;m just starting this now,but I&#39;m going to go out on a limb here, and assume Joe didn&#39;t ask about why he has three homes and the situation with his wife and that school?<br /><br />Inb4 that has nothing do with him running for office.<br />One rule for thee another for meVOTE BERNIE 2020You wanna make “the worst parts of the country better”? VOTE OUT DEMOCRATS!!! They are all run by democrats.I hope he will endorse Andrew yang soon 😬😬 😂 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang2020">#yanggang2020</a>Came here to say two things:<br /><br />1. It’s good to have all kinds of viewpoints on so good job joe. <br /><br />2. Fuck Bernie Sanders to hell.Thanks papa Bernie, but Yang’s got it from here. We need somebody with 21st century solutions for 21st century problems.Love ya Joe but this guy is a sham :./FUCKING COMMIECan we have Donald Trump next?Oooooooh shitNow you get Ted Cruz, Trey gowdy and Rand Paul on<br />Make it happen <br />Joe &quot;RoboJoRo&quot; RoganChina still controls TibetJoe Rogan! Asking Presidential candidates the hard hitting questions you won&#39;t hear on the mainstream media: Would you let us know if you found out about them aliens? xDGood on you, Joe. It&#39;s refreshing to see an outlet with influence provide a space for a candidate to discuss policy in-depth.The insurance companies and Pharmaceutical companies had a chance to help American through the ACA they chose Greed they chose to crush the American people I say that<br /> was their last chance. Fuck them go Bernie Go medicare for all!Bernie Sanders is LITERALLY part of the 1%I want to see Bernie light up a fat doobie with Toe Rogan.Canada ftwDoes anyone else wish Joe had an extra 2 min after the interview to say what he thought of the conversation?Joe Rogan is really moving up, lol. Maybe he&#39;ll get Trump, Obama, or Bush on his podcast. Can you imagine that? If Joe Rogan became much more refined, official, and the bridge between the mainstream and the neo-internet section. We need to push this further. Someone needs to try to get Rogan to get people higher up. Maybe more Congressmen first. Then maybe an ex Vice President. Then snag a big fish like Bush.If Yang wasn&#39;t in the race, I would support Bernie. Such a good, intelligent, and interesting man.Bernie never had an honest job and it shows.Thanks Joe.125 trillion dollars in unfunded &quot;Democratic Socialist&quot; liabilities <a href="http://usdebtclock.org/">usdebtclock.org</a> And Bolshevik Bernie Sanders doesn&#39;t think the united states is socialist enough! Fuck you Joe Rogan you worthless leftist piece of shit.There&#39;s no way to sugarcoat this, Bernie&#39;s way too old to run for office. Just as how there&#39;s a minimum age requirement to run for president, there should also be a maximum age limit to it.Joe &quot;how is that even legal&quot; Rogan.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=3m50s">3:50</a> Not gonna lie, what if we just put that shit on PBS? Would that not work?As a proud Vermonter... Skip!He says some stuff that makes sense...and then out comes the socialist nonsense...socialism CANNOT be forced upon the masses. Especially America. Shortest JRE episode ever...Bernie had to go take a nap. $15 an hour in NY for the past 6 months and people are already getting their hours cut or losing their jobs, people are hiring less. Also, what about the people that were getting paid $15 an hour? do they deserve a 40% raise? what about smaller communities and towns that can hardly afford their local minimum wage? questions a socialist wont answer. I can&#39;t afford to hire anybody at $15.Ross Perot actually had the right ideas, Bernie does not. You cant tax to death the working and middle classes in order to have a welfare state.Healthcare is as much of a human right as refusing healthcare is. BOOM. Argument over.NiceOh my God it finally happened!!!Wow. Bernie mentioned the whole &quot;The democratic debates are reality TV&quot; line that Andrew Yang said.<br /><br />I wonder... If Bernie is eyeing Yang as a potential running mate? <br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang2020">#YangGang2020</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MATH">#MATH</a>Those weird sound bites arnt debates, it&#39;s just sad.Hr hour in and not one fucking decent hard question? What about open borders or guns things that he doesn&#39;t agree with him on I&#39;m 35 Min in and hearing shit about the shootings and I guarantee he thinks taking guns away from citizens would be great!This is a historic podcast. Thank you Joe!Joe had some great questions at the 50 minute mark. Real questions that no one is addressing.  Bullshit answer from Bernie. I think it&#39;s just never been asked before. It&#39;s not a talking point to get to the root of the problem.Although he has zero remedies for anything he says. Its great he opened himself.up to actually speaking in a calm setting and no one to shout over or be interruptedBernie Sanders loves to talk about how other countries do this and do that so we should do it too! If you love other countries sooo much by all means PLEASE GO!! Damn i can&#39;t stand him &amp; his terrible lies about how great socialized healthcare is in other countries! It&#39;s really NOT so great Bernie!Bernie Scamders. DNC puppet.Joe’s bottom lip looks like he’s either dipping or it got busted up rolling around. Aside from that, great questions and clear responses. This podcast just keeps getting better and better. When will Joe announce he’s running for president? I want to think he knows he has a decent shot.Alright, Trump next time???He really broke down his policies that cannot be broken down in 40 seconds. Thanks Joe Rogan for having him on here. You should aim to get other candidates on here so we can hear them out and get real unfiltered answers.Yang gangPlease do not give a socialist more air time. Go to UK to get more air time! I live in common wealth of Va.,  commwealth is founded on socialism!  I don&#39;t want to depend on government! Please don&#39;t believe this is a good thing! Socialism is all about controlling people and there money!Joe Rogan gives everyone a fair shake. This show is awesome man, that is what I like about him.College tuition exploded as a result of government college loans.  Prove me wrongget bernie and tulsi on the same episode joeholy shit!!! BERNIE!!!Joe Rogan Experience #1330 - Bernie Sanders<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Woah.One of the questions Joe should&#39;ve asked was &quot;Why won&#39;t you look at me?&quot;YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!!The 2nd amendment is not about hunting or tradition it’s about the people being able to protect them selves from monolithic governmentsNeither Joe Rogan nor Bernie Sanders has ever lived one day of their lives as if climate change exists.4.7k MAGA CHUDS / SHILLARY LOVERS ARE SAD.I like Bernie, but his politics are trash. Socialism? No thanks. He&#39;s spent his entire career as a politician. That&#39;s kind of gross. Not something to be proud of.  He&#39;s never really contributed anything or had any adult responsibility. Maybe that&#39;s why milenials love him?  He is like your favorite high school history teacher who sleeps in his car in the teachers parking lot. He&#39;s interesting, but not someone you take seriously.  I do like him, but would never vote for him or anyone who actually wants to make the government bigger. Bernie wants to supersize it ...and your tax bill.Did somebody clip joes nuts b4 this episode. He knows the stats on these false gun stats and “gun show loophole” is absolute bs. the biggest of softball questions haven’t been thrown since his last cnn interview, I’m less proud to be a Rogan fan from this aloneBRING RON PAUL ON!!!Great podcast. Amazing how an hour can really open a person&#39;s mind to a presidential candidate. We need to do this more with all presidential candidate and really let them voice their opinions and concerns about the problems our great country and world are facing!SHUT UP YOU OLD CUNT 😎I hate it when politicians talk about “free healthcare” bitch it ain’t free. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23orangemanbad">#orangemanbad</a>Bernie is a MOSSAD agent dont vote for him!!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m00s">24:00</a> Please get Mitch on the show. I don&#39;t like the guy but I dislike Bernie more.Love how some people hate when Joe gives a person of one Party a platform then love when he gives the other one. No matter what party you’re all hypocrites.NHS in UK isn&#39;t great people in America, 4 week wait to see a GP, then when you see one you get least skill full one. I&#39;ve been waiting to see a neurologist for 1 year now, 17 years of illness and these quacks don&#39;t give a shit. Thinking of coming to America to see a Proper Doctor. And a i was told i had cancer, they got it wrong. Don&#39;t go down the socialist route 👍 🇺🇸🇺🇸This is awesome!I&#39;m from Germany and I really can&#39;t understand why anyone wouldn&#39;t want to vote for Bernie. He seems like a genuinely nice and concerned guy and his points really make sense. If you don&#39;t take him I&#39;d gladly ship him to Germany to run for Chancellor here.&quot;do they (Canada) have problems (with their healthcare system)&quot;. Yeah like year-long waitlists for major surgeries“dOeSnT mATtEr WhO YoU VoTeD fOr..” shut the Fuuuuuck upHe’s an idiotget TrumpOh my God he went the AOC 12-year thing Jesus Christ can it get any worse!!??Fucking lost me once he started talking guns .. ALLLLL weapons are ASSAULT weapons ..<br />Assault planes<br />Assault knives<br />Assault trucks full of fertilizer <br /><br />GtohYea hes not gonna winBernie is right. Now I might just vote for him.I&#39;m voting for Bernie this was a great interview Joe 👍 thanks youI was a fan of Bernie until those BLM chicks stormed his stage on 2016 and took his mic away. That right there made me vow to never vote for him. We cant have a straight of pussy for president. He’s a damn limp noodle with no spine. It sucks cause I like a lot of what he says.Bernie sure loves Canada a lot. Why doesn&#39;t he just move there with his ridiculous solutions?this guys been in government longer than I&#39;ve been alive and he&#39;s done nothing but make people dumber and schill for the DNC while he pretends to be an independent. oh he sure loves his wars when democrats wage them.So glad Joe is seems like hes starting to get it. I love Bernie Sanders but I was starting to give up on Joe Rogan.On assumption to drugs...MARIJUANANobody:<br /><br />Bernie: <b>JAMIE WOULD YA PULL UP THA STATISTICS ON THE TAHP WUN PUHCENT</b>Love him or hate him. He has balls to be on the right wing platform.Saw this in my feed and just shook my head in disbelief... alright I’m strapped in and ready...What happened to Tibet ?   IdiotOh God. It’s Bernie “SUPER CUCK” Sanders. Yayyyyy ....🙄I happen to believe Bernie can go fuck himself when it comes to his second amendment point of view. The second amendment wasn’t designed for hunting, it was designed to fight and protect yourself from a tyrant governmentHaven’t finished, but does joe ask why he pulled out in 2016?Lets get Trump on the show, Art of the Deal up in here.<b>WE DONT WANT STUDENT DEPT</b><br />* Ok epic, how we paying it off? * <br />* CHARGE THE FILTHY 1% RICH MORE! * <br />                      Big brain time.<br />* Ok? But the rich allready pay more *<br />* WE WANT A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE! *<br />* Ok but what happens when your supermarket goes out of business and you can&#39;t eat? *<br />* WE WANT FREE FOOD! SAVE US ALL! *<br />* Ok but what happens when we take more of your paycheck in taxes to do this? *<br />* WE WANT A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE! *<br /><br /><br />... Seeing a trend here?  <br /><br />Seeking better quality life for all simply makes the overall quality of life worse for all. It&#39;s time America stops complaining and making exuses and gets off our asses and works for what we want and need together. Life is not free. Frankly if it was, I would be bored.American people: “fuck amazon and Jeff Bezos, making billions not paying taxes. We need to hold them accountable for this bullshit. Eat the rich”<br /><br />Also the American people: <b>buy enough shit on amazon, because they need instant gratification, to generate $142 billion in sales</b>And putting all those things in the column controlled by the federal government reduces your choice to exactly 1. And nobody holds the US government accountable. No thanks, Bernie! I was homeless as a child. Now, my family of 5 has multiple homes and a comfortable life. it was the power of capitalism that made it possible. Socialism restricts opportunity, reduces choice, and often kills those who depend on it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CAPITALISM">#CAPITALISM</a>.<br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TRUMP2020">#TRUMP2020</a>!Trump 2020Gotta love how serious he is about these issues, he’s not playing around and he’s not playing the American people. Bernie 2020Man, I disagree with all of his politics but cannot wait to listen to to this on the way to work. Hope Joe asks about him being a career politician and literally never working! Oh man, I listened to the 1st 20. Ask Bernie if oxygen is a human right.Bernie&#39;s a bus in a grand prix.Lets not forget about the death panels in Canada there BernieIs Joe the second coming?Andrew Yang&gt;Sanders&gt; othersThis has been very disappointing. Joe throwing softballs and Bernie dodging them instead of hitting home runs like he should have. <br /><br />Question: Well you wanna fix (A), how will you do it?<br /><br />Answer: Well we have to tell them this isn&#39;t acceptable, (A) isn&#39;t acceptable. In other countries (A) doesn&#39;t exist.Fucking joe rogan!!!! Amazing interviewCool story bro...Some problems with socialized medical: 1. It becomes a monopoly(you don&#39;t like it? tough you are already their bitch!). 2. The rationing 3. Wait times dramatically increased for everything! 4. Competition? Options? second opinion? (refer to 1). 5, the government doesn&#39;t do anything &quot;cheaper&quot; or more economical. 6. Good doctors won&#39;t put up with being paid and treated same as shitty doctors.I bet joe couldn&#39;t wait to give Bernie some tips that would help his posture. Joe is a fitness enthusiast after all. Lol<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=44m00s">44:00</a> A politician admitting to having a layman&#39;s view on a subject is so refreshingBernie Sanders on Joe Rogan <br />This is huge.Yasssss queen!If you make guns illegal people will find a way to get them. i.e. drugs, prohibition, etc. When there’s a demand, there’s a supply. Just the way it is- now they are talkin about itThe true utopia is that things can go on as they are without exploding antagonismsMan I&#39;m not a fan of Bernie at all but I&#39;ll give him props on coming on a show where the majority of viewers don&#39;t like him.my brain is in recovery mode from all the high level important ideasI am excited to see the energy sources we have in 12 yearsI think the charge that most of these people are mentally Ill should be grounded in facts.  Most of these people know exactly what they are doing.  They plan it out and execute their plan.  I would guess that these are broken people.  Not sick deranged people.I love Joe Rogan but he is a fucking moron.  He is a stoner Oprah.  He doesn&#39;t even know the basic workings of our healthcare, education, and lobbying.  Bernie is a dictator because he wants to impose federal control over every state and local community in the United States.  Bernie is claiming federal powers that the federal government doesn&#39;t have.  He is shamelessly lying. And Joe Rogan is too stupid to know the difference.Nobody&#39;s going to go to school for 12 years to be a doctor and only make $80,000<br />When they can graduate high school make the same money with no degree supply and demandThe idea of people taking care of themselves when a psycho walks into a place intending to do harm didn&#39;t even play into his thought process. He was real thankful for the police to intervene, but police can&#39;t be everywhere,and we don&#39;t want them everywhere. People need to be ready and willing to protect themselves, at the very least.  It is nobody else&#39;s responsibility.From gavin mclnnes to bernie sanders. No matter where you stand... it&#39;s great to see a platform on the web talking to bothThis was a really great interviewFeel like Bernie on this platform is going to convert many people, It blows my mind how someone could hear him out for a long period of time on important issues and still disagree with everything he has to say. Bernie is the antidote to Trump and he HAS to be the nominee if we not only want to garuntee Trump is a one term president, but transform the democratic party and this country, there&#39;s no other option.Socialism kills.  Look up Mao Tse Tung.Bernie seems a lot less crazy in this discussion than he did during his 2 debate performances, when he isn&#39;t competing with the rest of the radical left he isn&#39;t as bad. 2016 Bernie was also less into identity politics than his 2020 run. I think Rogan should have asked him more questions conservatives care about: illegal immigration, border security, jobs/economy, foreign policy, the massive debt and deficit problems, his thoughts on some elements of the radical left such as Antifa, etc...I bet Bernie had to know every question that joe was going to ask before agreeing to thisa tax on buying and selling stocks???  what??Let&#39;s make a joe rogan debate. 1 candidate per episodeLike George soros. Bernie ??????Bernie, I love you bro.. but you got to stop the explaining how it used to be. Just speak to the programs moving forward. No more history lessons.  Somebody close to him help..Fuck all politicians!  Joe Rogan 2020!Climate change is a nazi??AS SOON AS BERNIE BUYS INTO THE LAS VEGAS FAKE SHOOTING HE NO LONGER SOUNDS INTELLIGENTThanks Joe<br />Can you help me out with a down payment on a house?<br />PleaseToday Bernie Sanders interviews Mr. Clean! 🚀Have Mike Gravel on and roll a joint with his campaign merchYeah pops. This ain’t 40-50 years ago. Things change and both the American government and the American people have not been able to adapt successfully, and it seems at this rate, the inevitable end (and beginning) is quite ruinous.Google is manipulating the likes!When a leftist talks about community, he always talks about giving money to all ethnics but the whites.<br />F****you WandersBernie is wrong. Vote trump.God damn, This will be 2nd after God Elon Musk .I agree with the problem of expensive education ...but the answer should be making it easy for Alternative forms of Education to come into existence that can drastically undercut their competition. Rather than using violence to coarsely Force others to pay for another person kid to be educated and at grotesquely overrated ..and aging education system.Go fuck yourself you commie bastardI&#39;m not a Bernie fan, but you gotta respect a politician who&#39;s willing to have a conversation in this sort of format.If presidential candidates can debate on this podcast that would be EPIC.Bernie is still a joke 😂Legalize prostitution!, that’ll calm the incels down<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BERNIE2020">#BERNIE2020</a>One of my Facebook friends hates Joe because he brings a lot of right wing people on his show. Well hey mother fucker. Guess what?Joe sold out ages ago!United States of Corporate America.Wow can&#39;t believe Bernie Sanders has joined the alt-right by being on this podcast.<br /><br />/si hope that bernie wins and then comes back in RoganBernie 2020I can explain health care in 10 secs. If we don&#39;t controlour immigration policy prior to socialist healthcare. Or American health Care whichever you&#39;d like to call it. If we can&#39;t stop the influx of new immigrants what&#39;s to stop everyone who wants from coming here and getting free healthcare. So if we control our borders then we can actually figure out the cost of the health care for Americans who live here. can you tell me how we can offer free healthcare for all Americans without being able to assess the cost?Where&#39;s the Kanye podcast?Hmm... Hearing a lot of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AndrewYang">#AndrewYang</a> words, basically verbatim, with either no solution offered or parroting Yang&#39;s solutions.  There was little, in my estimation, that has been said here that wasn&#39;t explained better, in clearer terms and with better solutions offered by Yang.  Bernie supporters, I have listened to this entire conversation to hear out your candidate.  I challenge you to do the same.  Just search for &quot;Joe Rogan Experience #1245 - Andrew Yang&quot;.Great podcast.<br /><br />Although - here&#39;s a trend I&#39;ve noticed: The more important/well-known the guest, the shorter the podcast.Ha ha ha that ufo question was  awesome,  that&#39;s why I love joeO shiiiiiiitWe should definitely implement a tiered system for minimum wage. Raising minimum wage for everyone will hurt small businesses.Get wes watson on hereJoe Rogan you are the man!!! Thanks for providing the people with what they really want!This tired old fart 😂😂This will be the least watched JRE ever.<br /><br />I literally started the video in the middle of the upload and the first thing I heard is &quot;the top 1 percent!&quot;<br /><br />Bernie literally has no other pitch in politics.Joe, Bernie lost any respect I had for him when he folded to Hillary. He had it won, all he had to do was fight. He’s just as corrupt as all the rest of them. Bad move JoeRogan&#39;s a beastBernie Sanders for Prez.  Tulsi Gabbard for VP.   Andrew Young for secretary.  JRE press secretary!!!Finally a jre episode with no nBernie&#39;s a political gramophone.Hella haters, means they are feeling the burnOMG 😮Bernie Sanders!!! You made it Joe! You made it! I saw this pop up and and became so excited.Holy shit!!!! Nice guest!Please have Peter Schiff on immediatelyI&#39;m just here to say fuck Bernie, and anyone who supports Socialism.Every candidate needs to be on this showSocialist gets in office country goes broke companies leave , Democrats tax the middle class stop giving out government refunds at the end of the year. Politicans living good life .  They proudly destroyed the country because it&#39;s a imperialist and colonized country . ( which the people who ran Bernie campaign believe )<br /><br />Citizens who supported them: well they lied guess capitalist where right. Cant do nothing now we don&#39;t have the guns to fight tyrannical government.I understand that he was probably restricted on how much he could push back in order to have Bernie be on, but man I wish Joe would have actually made the arguments that we&#39;ve all heard him make on a million other JREs.oh yeah. the cats already out of the bag.thank you joe roganThis is superb fucking content!!! hell yeahhthe solution is simple. have joe rogan moderate at least one debate on his show. I&#39;m sure the candidates would agree to it and the american people would realize just how drastically different a debate can be when you actually let the candidates speak. plus it would drive the msm crazyLol YoooooooJoe You&#39;re a multi millionare who has worked hard for everything you have. You do realize that socialists like Bernie would have no problem taxing you @ 90% and confiscating you and other wealthy peoples property through violent force if necessary?Joe &quot;I have a herpe healing on the right side of my lip&quot; Roganbernie sanders supporters are fucking SHEEPhe opened up with Yang...love this interviewJoe: so how would you do X?<br />Bernie: Because we&#39;re going to do it!<br />Joe: okay so how would you go about doing it if you were president tomorrow? <br /><br />Bernie: I&#39;m gonna say that we&#39;re gonna do it!Drinking game:<br />Every time Joe or Bernie say “It’s not a radical idea” take a shot. <br />You’ll be as trashed as this country isJesus, i could see Bernie in the white house now.<br /><br /><br />&quot;I made some cawfee, anybody want cawfee? CAWFEE HERE!&quot;Bernie Sanders is a thot. He&#39;s a freaking nasty hoe. He looks GOOD. I&#39;d love Bernie to bust my pussy open and tell me about Medicare for All. Ifa guy shows up with a Brooklyn accent and a copy of Our Revolution he can hit my back walls any fucking time of day dude. If a guy&#39;s like &quot;Just three men own as much wealth as the lowest 50% of Americans&quot; I&#39;m like &quot;take a rifle to the back of my head like Rosa Luxemburg&quot;Sounds good Bernie but listening to someone that has been in this government for decades b*tching about it, sadly u have done SH*T about any of it. Thinking ur the white knight that will save the day now....just not buying it. Trump said he wants to make America great again, none of u have worked with him to fix anything...all of u have just stood in his way and make wild claims u could do it better, but haven&#39;t made a shred of effort to show it.petition for joe to hold his own debate lol. no commercials, no interruptions, just answersWhat happens if Bernie announces Tulsi as his running mate and Andrew Yang will be in his cabinet?It&#39;s disappointing  how soft Joe can be in challenging the person he interviews. Even if you agree with someone, playing devil&#39;s advocate allows the conversation to expand and requires deeper explanation of a subject.Bernie romanticizing Canadian health careGreat interview. Loving the crying chuds in the comments 😆Get Bernie on hot ones, get him elected through clout!!what a fraudMore taxes... greatJo, you are now officially the King.Bernie should be specific about amazon they don&#39;t pay corporate tax, however they pay billions in payroll taxes and other local taxes.Jimmy, Kyle, Cornel, and now Bernie? Sub earned.Bernie want&#39;s 15 dollar minimum wages, but his own Staff are starving.<br />50 year old guy who still have student loans??? Didn&#39;t Bernie say that college was almost free back then? so how can that 50 year old guy still have student loans?<br /><br /><br />Loads of other things that he made up.GO BERNIE!!!I like Bernie Sanders and I think he has some good ideas, but I have two problems with him. One, he&#39;s just too nice. Nothing wrong with being nice, but he just gives me a feeling that he&#39;d be a pushover (maybe I&#39;m wrong). Two, he doesn&#39;t do a great job explaining himself and his policies all the time. In my opinion he doesn&#39;t really break it down like he should, sometimes he doesn&#39;t answer questions directly.All this coming from a man that had  to cut his staff ours in half in order to pay for the $15 an hour minimum wage. He&#39;s a fiscally ignorant moron.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dySZbIoGygY&amp;app=desktop">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dySZbIoGygY&amp;app=desktop</a> Our future communist tyrants...Hey Bernie, it’s 2019, NOT 1919 you sick BolshevikReality TV show? Hmm wonder where I heard it before. Oh <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AndrewYang">#AndrewYang</a>! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>Where is TrumpYang gangHere would be a good question: &quot;if you were presented with things you said against Hillary in 2016, would you backtrack or double down?&quot;Fuck this Socialist piece of shit, liar. How do you not provide things for other people without forcefully taking it from others?   BULLSHITWow he actually got Bernie on.<br />Can&#39;t wait to see if he will bring up DMT, elk hunting, Area 51 etc.Watch next he will be on Hot Ones with Sean EvansHere before trendingIt’s not criminal people want guns to protect them from its our monolithic government the same reason it’s in our constitutionJust tell the truth you have to raise taxes to do it all the billionaires combined still won&#39;t be enough to pay for it such b&#39;s trying to buy a vote by promising free stuff don&#39;t have to open your wallet ha then how do you pay the taxes socialist will destroy this country and your freedomsoh lord... so many triggered trump fans here.... relax boys if you do not agree, you do not have to be that triggeredBernie should get into ASMRI love this man! Wish him luckJoe, your dedication to your podcast is unprecedented.  The questions you asked and the retorts you had were on point.  This was such a great interview as was the Tulsi Gabbard podcast.  All candidates should be doing this so we can actually hear what the fuck they have to say rather than these 10 second sound bites that the debates are designed to get.  Thank you for these fantastic interviews. I hope to see more presidential candidates on here.I bet the journos are now confused about Joe. Is He still an alt right figure? Is Sander now enabling Joe&#39;&#39;the gateway to the right &#39;&#39; Rogan?Love your show brother but you slow pitched and walked the old man!This is why this is the BEST podcast!I don&#39;t think Bernie&#39;s right on the UK air time thing, never seen a 30 minute ad for politicians (maybe 30 mins per day?) and don&#39;t think they get it free.I would honestly listen to an hour of each candidate in this format...The antidote to despair is facing adversity and realizing that you&#39;re not made of glass. <br />Coddling people the way Bernie is talking about is the reason people feel desperate and have given up. We are becoming weak, while reality stays the same.I wish Joe was more informed on small businesses and economics...I would like someone like Bernie to talk to someone from the private sector that runs a small business...he always talks about these large corporations...but how does his policies effect the average person out there?   He never addresses that.Why does Joe constantly have lefties on?Wish Joe would have asked Bernie’s thoughts on the DNC screwing him last election and why he supported Hillary even though he was directly screwed over by her, Debbie wasserman schultz and the DNCdoes his healthcare plan cover his chin joining his nipples?It’s like not if you remember what this guy let happen last election.the only way to stop these mass shootings is to not put it on tv or the internet. you dont see high speed chases as much anymore. the disturbed mind just wants attention wether good or bad. try to control anything and it will get worse. it is a tool and EVERYONE should be educated as so. EVERYONE.Bernie&#39;s political accordian music.Came here hoping to see bernie light one up.The problem with Bernie Sanders and other democratic candidates promoting universal health is that they completely disregard the aspect of culture.<br /><br />Americans live more unhealthy lives.  I refuse to pay for the healthcare for people who are too sorry to stop drinking soda and go for a run.<br /><br />If we had a nation of people who were truly being healthy then we would save trillions without adjusting our system at all.<br /><br />The American people is America’s biggest problem.  Search your feelings, you know it to be true...If we are taxed for college, healthcare, foodstamps, housing, daycare, climate change and more for not just us but for millions coming here  ... how are we not slaves to the state?I&#39;m from the UK and the common consensus from my experience when discussing gun ownership is generally: why own a piece of hardware that can cause so much devastation and horror. <br />I understand there are law abiding citizens who have their right to own arms but I just can&#39;t wrap my head around why owning a gun that can instantly kill someone as we have seen time and time again is a good idea? It&#39;s true the man not the gun commits the crime but is it not in everyone&#39;s best interest to take away such a deadly object?Socialist scum.only an hour with papa bernie? not sure what that means for the social democrats but i’m pretty sure every time Alex jones is on the pod runs 2hrs+Is the bubonic plague a disease of despair?Lets feel the bern 2020He&#39;s the best candidate by far. I hope people can see that.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>I&#39;m a Trump supporter, but Bernie seems like one of the more understanding politicians these days.What if, instead of a policy of mutually assured destruction, we endorse a policy of mutual construction? We could have a rail belt under the Bering Sea so you could take a train from New York City to London, or from Cape Town to Copenhagen or from Tierra Del Fuego to Montreal.All these companies that are complaining about 15$ an hour aren&#39;t gonna be complaining when consumer spending increases with all that extra money in peoples pockets....Fuck that guyWhoa, Larry, shut the fuck up right at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=15m30s">15:30</a>. Women DIDN&#39;T WANT TO VOTE. Men fought for them to vote. Women didn&#39;t want to have the same rights men had for 100 years prior like going to war, and water bucket duty for fires. WOMP WOMP.anyone who wants socialism shoud gtfo of america and move to venezuela or something we dont want your fuckin socialismWHAAAAAAAAAT!!!! &lt;3Crazy Bernie aka Gloomy Bernie aka Depressing Bernie.There are NOT &quot;hundreds oif mass shootings&quot;  a year in the country.  Joe is a liarDamn it&#39;s 4 A.M and i was going to sleep :/ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>We have to rebuild American independence and stop focusing on the damn economy that only enriches the elite!Notice no mention of making school cheaper. Just pay them. What a moron. You take on the debt, you pay it. Pick a Cheaper school. Tax tax tax tax. Literally all he has said.<br /><br />Assault weapons?? I&#39;m really tired of these lies with these lying catch phrases. Essentially all guns are semi-automatic. No one is selling assault weapons. For fucks sake he is lying... Then again he doesn&#39;t even know the countries in WW2... CHINA, huh???I&#39;m not sure if Bernie is the answer but it&#39;s nice to here him call out drug companies and billionaires for their greed but I think he is right no one person can fix the problem has to be the people.This is going to win Bernie so many votes.I will NEVER vote for Sanders.Great episode. Bernie 2020!Bernie you don&#39;t talk about healthcare you are talking about paying the bill. You can go into any hospital and get care thats a factAmerica&#39;s dad o7what a SLAM DUNK....Bernie on here..JOE...YOU ARE MY HERO!!Let it Bern! Can you feel the heat? 🔥🔥🔥Andrew Yang is Bernie 2.0, Bernie you would have been perfect from 1990-2016 but now its too late, your ideas dont take 100% automatisation and AI into account, your proposals should have been implemented in the 90s sadly they havent but fortunately there are Bernie 2.0 options that take that into account like yang. copy his UBI proposal in a bernie way and you get my vote rather than asian guy, but on UBI he is right, not so right on climate change and foreign policy so i beg you bernie, adopt Ubi in some form, i dont want to be forced to clean streets when there are robots available for that. So bernie can you make a UBI that excludes millionaires and billionaes but is for everyone else? then im gonna vote for you, i like you more than yang but job guarantee is trash compared to some form of &quot;ubi&quot; it doesnt have to be yangs ubi, you can make a democratic socialist ubi with different rates and other laws but some form of ubi and be it only 500 a month for non millionaires+ 15/h min wage is a superior move, i dont want to vote for yang i want you, but please consider any form of ubi then you are also ready for the future, if not maybe yang but i dont like him besides ubi or it will make trump! if people need to learn the hard way go trump! lol kidding i never would go trump but i could see going yang for ubi alone of bernie doesnt want to adapt, you can totally exclude rich people form ubi and make it 500 instead of 1k but any form has to be included, thanksI can&#39;t believe I&#39;m watching thisJoe adjusted Bernie&#39;s mic for him. Bernie #1 alpha confirmed.Get this clown off your show. He had his chance last run and knowing the dnc was cheating him he still stepped aside. He is not president materialI don’t like Bernie, I think his ideas would help us. But, HE IS RIGHT when he says the corporations and money run this country and they are doing fuck all for the American people.This is going to get Bernie electedHaha Bernie &quot;in 1941 in 1963 in 1996 damm Bernie... what next.The part about in Canada you go to any doctor you want, and you don’t have to take out your wallet is a blatant lie Bernie. Are you lying because you are trying to pull the wool over our eyes or do you just not know these things?<br /><br />And quality of care is awful.He&#39;s a white rich male. His opinion is worthless. Sorry, just using his logic agains him.I turned it off at &quot;you&#39;d have to pass legislation&quot;. Fuck offOh. This happened, huh?This is super radical, come on!!! He wants everyone&#39;s money! The conservative trope is accurate. I&#39;m glad that money blocks your crazy bull.You think raising min wage will help you  will be sadly  disappointed! That only raises the cost of living and inflation of all products so you dont make any more money at the end of the day. People working these jobs are just to dumb to understand that. Min wag is for kids not adults , unless you have down or straight up retarded so min wage min effort.According to Bernie Sanders 99.9% of gun owners are good people that would never hurt anyone.  According to this same person 0.1% of the population is a reason to destroy the constitution.  Sad&quot;Free Hyundai Sonatas For Everybody&quot; Bernie SandersBernie seems sad10 billion tonnes of ice melted in greenland in one day last week if thats not climate change i dont know im glad i dont live near the sea i guess 😑Alex Jones and Joe Rogan need to head up the next debatesThe amount of us good citizens who own firearms who would stand up to these cowards who try an kill innocent people is more then you think... I wish they would outlaw heroine that’s killing a lot of people..... oh waitYou constantly hear people say women didn&#39;t have the right to vote, that&#39;s false.<br /><br />In order to vote when this nation was founded you had to be a landowner, because they felt you needed to have skin in the game.<br /><br />If you didn&#39;t have skin in the game, then you could frivolously vote anyway you wanted without having any major impact on yourself.<br /><br />They were absolutely right on that aspect, women who  owned property and land were able to vote, so that is not true.Never thought you would invite Bernie.Genuine question. What issues if any do you have with what Bernie has said?1950s one family member could work and provide for his whole family. They could could pay for their cars in all cash, send their kids to college, and still make it back in time to BBQ. What happened?The people having pts over these shootings probably need to be exposed to guns. I know it sounds counter intuitive and maybe even cruel, but seriously, cognitive behavioral therapy - expose them to the stimulus, in a controlled environment, and over time they will heal.Ok. If you’re going to do this, at least give the trump train a chance to explain everything he’s done to those less ignorant and uneducated than me. <br /><br />We want it. The American People want it. I want it.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=54m15s">54:15</a><br />Bernie nailed it. 👏🏼&quot;&#39;I&#39;m gonna make a comment trashing Bernie before even watching the podcast&quot; - typical JRE viewerJoe dressed up for this interview..Start the choppers.Bernie &quot;you know how much the California state college cost years ago?&quot; rogan, how much? I dunno....<br />That&#39;s Bernie in a nutshell that one conversation he&#39;s an idiotReally? its not much to pay 15 dollar minimum wage in the rural American Diner when average income in those area is $31,000. Might not be too crazy to ask that money to cooperation,  but to small stores?  Federal minimum is built upon this fantasy that every America operates like San Francisco. Leave this to States.He’s got my 🗳Here comes mass inflation with a 15-20 dollar living wageKids from the “hood” need opportunities to earn money and not be given money.  Bernie wants to take away purpose from people and when people have no purpose, they are easier to control.If you want the elimination of corruption, Bernie Sanders is the man for the job.This man is for the everyday people who are struggling in America yet y’all voted for trumpThank you for bringing Bernie on! I think he made a pretty solid point about &quot;Diseases of Despair&quot;, My father&#39;s drinking habits increased because of his depression, drug usage is a form of escapism, we need to transition our country in a direction that addresses humanity and mental health, that includes Medicare for All, better wages, unionization and community building.  <br /><br />Thanks Joe!i want to fart in Bernie&#39;s mouthChina huh? I thought we fought the Japan in WW2...  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Libtard">#Libtard</a>GUN SHOW LOOP HOLES IS NOT A THING!!!!Yea yea bla bla bla... same old political jargon... bunch of promises and ideas and no plausible way of delivering.  I wouldn&#39;t buy a lawnmower from this skeleton in a bag.he doesn&#39;t even have the energy to sit up straight in his chair. How can he possibly be worth a shit as president... wtf gtfoC&#39;mon Joe , you are not having a conversation with one of your friends,  this guy will shape your life and the life of your kids. Some push back and make him explain some of this crazy ideas would be great. He basically did not say  nothing new by have over an hour conversation,  he minus well be on the debate stage.And   HERE  WE  GO!Holly shit Joe. You made it happen.  Bravo, amazing work. Brother Cornel Wested started this conversation and now we get to hear it from Bernie himself.This guy hasn’t explained who is going to pay for these ridiculous ideas.  If single payer or Medicare for all was so great, we would have already done it.  Healthcare needs some regulation, but the government couldn’t run a lemonade stand efficiently, and politicians don’t need to control only one sixth of the US economy.  Healthcare isn’t a right, nobody has the right to the fruits of another’s labor.  Guns, there is no doubt that politicians unequivocally want to disarm law abiding citizens.  They want a  monopoly on violence.  They want absolute control, the second amendment was not penned to preserve hunting rights, it was written to maintain the status quo between the people and the ruling class.  The federal government was not originally granted power to control every facet of American life.    Global cooling...warming...no, climate change.  “I believe in science” was the depth of his knowledge of the subject. That, and we have 12 years, then we’re all gonna die if we don’t give the government more power and cash, because only they can fix it.  Sounds an awful lot like communism when you back up and look at Bern from a distance.  He wants government to dictate everything.  Resources and means of production belong to the state.  He is a unique candidate, I’ll give him that.Fantastic!!!So many right wing Joe Rogan fans can&#39;t stand anyone left of Joe Biden. (who is a conservative by definition) Or they don&#39;t like that ideas other than (-----) are being discussed.Bernie on Rogan versus Trump on infowars............Joe doesn’t know enough about politics to ask any meaningful questions or question any of Bernie’s stances. It’s a real shameI&#39;m not voting in the next election. Trump lost me the other day when he proposed Red flag gun laws. Bernie is a socialist. Yang is a gun grabber who wants to put more restrictions on firearms. <br /><br />All the candidates can go fuck themselves...Damn Joe did it. Rose above the podcast to review political. Not a lot of people get this chance.The mortality rates are also higher in other countries, you might get free treatment but doesn&#39;t mean its the best. There has to be a middle ground with healthcare costs but socialism isn&#39;t the answer. I am a healthcare worker,  in a small town  paying premium and we still have a shortage of nurses, doctors, his plan would leave us high and dry. Yeah come on in free treatment, but nobody to care for you.Senator Sanders, I&#39;m still waiting for this post on your social media:<br />President Trump, thank you for killing the TPP. Ending it was the cornerstone of my last presidential campaign. Thank you for accomplishing what I failed to do.Joe should seriously host the presidential debates.FUCK YES!!!!!!!!Bernie only talks about the problem ad nauseum and offers solutions without taking into consideration the resistance. Does he seriously think having a rally in Kentucky will make Mitch McConnell vote the way he wants too. LMAO!! He&#39;s a bigger fool than I thought.I wanna know who reached out to who to make this happen. If Bernie reached out to Joe, then I gotta say it was a damn smart move.Alex Jones one day. Bernie Sanders the next. Joe Rogan is the GOATI don&#39;t agree with everything he said but all in all he seems like a genuine guy. Also good luck taking peoples  guns.Dam the wall street tax is a great ideaJoe Rogan for president 2020Not a Bernie fan but hats off to him for coming on the podcast.  Happy to see any conversation.The wacky Toadman with his mystical words and magic sounds.Let’s not forget about Andrew Yang. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yang2020">#yang2020</a>Sometime in the future they are going to give Joe a lot more credit than what he is getting now.<br />I hope he gets trump in and he tells him to shave off the wig. Imagine Trump with Joey diaz in the room.<br />&quot;I know what you did in the 80&#39;s dog, nobody was putting a brick on top of another without paying the mod their share, cocksucker&quot;Bernie &quot;I wrote the dam bill!&quot; Sanders.Listen openly. Do your Homework. Your democracy is worth itI know all of us Americans disagree on the Candidates for Presidency, but I&#39;m sure we could all agree that it is huge that Bernie came on to the J.R.E.🇺🇲 Joe Rogan for President  🇺🇲IN B4 demonization happens because Dems Mad about stuff.YOOOOOOOOThank you, Joe!HIPPA laws prevent the proper background checks.I hope joe asks him about his twitch stream playing the USSR national anthem lmaoThey dont spend half per capita. They spend half. They only have 10 percent of the population. Look it up. It&#39;s not per capitaYang or Sanders? I&#39;m leaning towards Yang because he seems like he has the answers.TRUMP 2020....2024....2028...2032! Nothing is free BERNIE!!!!This is the last guy trump wants to run against.  Bernie would embarrass him. Same polls that showed 2016 results dead on had Bernie beatig Trump by 10.8%.  The team MAGA comments down here just ooze ignorance.CALLS TRUMP A RACIST AND BLAMES MASS SHOOTINGS ON OUR PRESIDENT     FUCK YOU BERNIEWho knew that ten years later after the podcast began that Rogan would have Presidential candidates on the show. I think that is a testament to him &amp; us the audience.Fantastic closing question hahaOkokokNow have on Sam Seder, Michael Brooks, or Richard Wolff !Get Donald Trump on here Joe I honestly believe you might be able to pull it off lmaoDidnt even watch this trash. Bernie Sanders is a con. Trump 2020. Free Alex Jones.Saying health care is a basic human right is like saying 2+ 2 = 5.We need trade schools not collegeTo be among the top 1 percent of U.S. earners, a family needs an income of $421,926Bernie: I am a democratic socialist.<br /><br />Joe: Ever try DMT?My issue with student loan forgiveness is that I&#39;m aggressively paying off my big student loan, which is the last of our non-mortgage debt. I work all day everyday and don&#39;t have a life, so I can become debt free. I should have it paid off within the next 12 months. I also went to a school that shut down for fraud and I&#39;ve been in limbo with the dept of Ed for the last 3 years with my application for cancellation. I&#39;d be damned if a president would forgive everyone&#39;s student loans RIGHT AFTER I finished paying mine off because the government won&#39;t finalize my application for loan cancellation.The quality of care in Canada is not even close to the quality in the states. This is coming from a Canadian who has experienced both. Not even the same ball park.Lets ban drugs! Then no one can get a hold of them and no one will EVER overdose.You would think this would be longer but B.S. has things to do maybe. I do wish Joe would have challenged him a little but I think he just wanted B.S. to say what he wanted and that&#39;s cool too.Bernie/Tulsi2020! It&#39;s the best chance we have at beating Trump. But get ready for the DNC to screw this up again.Still for yang.  Facts and reality over anecdotal evidence and story telling.With a shrinking middle class comes an increase in crime. So the the poorer families tend to send their child to public school. Why not making sure every public school has a student counselor. Not to mention it should be mandatory that if you send your child to public school there needs to be mandatory attendance.Just saying I live in canada and trust me when I say the quality of healthcare is not better you&#39;ll wait 12hrs before seeing a doctor and than you&#39;ll see that doctor again in 4 months.. You want a heart transplant you&#39;re gonna be waiting over a year. You cant choose any doctor you want if you want to do that you&#39;ll pay! Some clinic cant even afford having doctors. Imagine 380million people plus all the illegals it would be imlossibleI would vote for this man but he&#39;s Democrat and I can&#39;t do that not what I saw after 2016 election anti-white rhetoric hate and nonsense... and before anyone says it&#39;s Trump&#39;s fault where has the biased opinion has been with the media the whole time Russia collusion Time After Time live after lies... and all this evil left-wing rhetoric is making people go crazy and scaring them too... just because they were lost one election99% of you would have passed this test but because 1%will fail we&#39;re going to give you all C&#39;s so those who failed feel better about not being responsible....Remember about 15 years ago when al gore said we had 10 years before the climate cant be fixedHi.<br />I’m from the UK! <br /><br />IMO ( In my opinion ) <br /><br />Bernie seems like man is going a beneficial direction and if may not be heard might be seen as an old push over.<br /><br />Bernie up against TRUMP I feel as if the man Bernie can legitimately speak quietly and calming engaging in knowledgable conversation. However. I feel as if the state is too corrupt to see a man of Bernie’s caliber enter as president and clenching presidential victory. Good luck America!Some good stuff was said.<br /><br /><br />THINK...<br />beGood<br />DOgood<br />peAce.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />and since SOMEbody wants to keep deleting and not showing my replies in my own comment:<br />idk who the fu&lt;K keeps holding my comments back, (cia, google, youtube, whoever you a$$holes are) what I said was: Evil and ignorance go hand in hand. What I&#39;m saying is THINK...cause it&#39;s kinda helpful in discerning right from wrong. But to me the idea of GOOD is what deserves the status of what it is to be &quot;God LIKE&quot;. Not saying I or anyone is &quot;God&quot;, or perfect for that matter. But simply to be and do Good is to be doing what someone who would deserve the title of God (and/or A god) would be doing, unlike the BULLsh¡t $atanic sh¡t a lot of people are following these days. And I think if we all, more the merrier, can manage to be Good and DO good, then where that will lead us equates to a place of being that could resemble what many like to doubt, and that&#39;s peAce. But, to go back to the top, none of us are infallible, so THINK...cause you can be bad but become good, but you can be &quot;good&quot; and always have a chance to fu&lt;k up. I&#39;m not a &quot;bible thumper&quot;, but I do see the good concepts and ideas in it, and to me it only makes since that the &quot;kingdom of heaven lies within us all&quot; is very true...meaning, we all are the individual pieces to the greater whole. So for us all to be working towards actual better for all, together, would make this place entirely better than it has been lately. Cause I nor anyone that I&#39;m aware of can do it alone, Heaven, like Hell, is a team effort, your choice...Joe, <br />Get Yang, Tulsi, and Bernie on all at once.<br /><br /><br /> Circumvent the debates!Why do so many people have an issue with investing in our people? We have a society that is angry, depressed, and a lot of that has to do with income inequality, poor healthcare among other things.  We bailed out the banks, we spend trillions on wars across the world, but when someone says hey, why not pay our people more so they can afford to go out once in a while, give them free education so we can compete in jobs of the future, make healthcare more affordable etc   people flip out.. why??? It&#39;s an investment in ourselves, I guess people must feel we are not worth it.Best last question everWhat happens when a modern day Gestapo comes marching through our neighborhoods kidnapping and killing whoever &quot;their&quot; enemies may be after we&#39;ve given up our high capacity weapons. That&#39;s why people want their &quot;assault style rifles&quot;. We have a better chance of fending off a tyrannical government with them than without.And joe let him get away with the &quot;assault weapon&quot; bullshit.Bernie spooks me when he won&#39;t make eye contact with joe🤔The DNC will never, ever let Bernie in to get the nomination.I love Bernie... just wish someone could point out to him on video that if he really quote listens to the scientists then he should be acknowledging nuclear energy as an integral component of our necessary efforts to combat climate change. I’m a nuclear scientist and I always feel like he is missing out on this fact. We need a nuclear engineer on JRE!Joe.. I’ve been a fan for years. But you need to push back on Bernie. Enough with the softball Q&amp;A. <br />You need to get him ready to debate Trump. Just pretend he walks into your gym and you have to get him ready for the fight of his life!Yyyyyyeeeeeesssssss!!!!!!!!!Bernie really isn&#39;t that bad. The only sad thing is that he caved in and supported Clinton and the establishment. Still have some respect for him, but lost some with that capitulation to Clinton after they cheated him out of winning.this fucking retard  doesent even pay his campaign staffers 15 bucks an hour until it became public and he got called out for it . he sucks socialism sucks this old bastard will never be president and his accent sucks too ps Donald Trump is still your president and will get re elected not cause he is awesome but because democrats have a big pile of shit for canidatesFight ww2 with China? And Joe didn&#39;t call him out? Wow. Bernie you should be old enough to remember that.Joe you&#39;ve talked to Peterson multiple times about how humans naturally create hierarchies when allowed to be free.  Why is it any different with wealth?what about the 13+ Trillion dollars of debt?I can&#39;t speak for the rest of the country, but as a kid fresh out of high school, I&#39;ve gotta say, I&#39;ve never met anyone genuinely stressed about shootings. As dark as this sounds, it really is just a reality that most people have accepted. We&#39;re all pretty numb about it, all the teachers freak out and get all depressed and preachy when it happens, but us kids don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass. People die all the time, and it&#39;s really difficult for a lot of us to relate to the older generation&#39;s who all expect us to be irreparably traumatized.joe needs to have every candidate on his show.geez... finally got through it all, that was hard, BS is just that... is badly informed and making assumptions, i was seriously shouting at times back at my TV with how dumb/misinformed he was... not comfortable at all...@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=48m20s">48:20</a> - offer him a blunt! :PGet trumpBernie is the only candidate that wants to stop corruption in gov caused by money from oil, media, drug companies. IDGAF about any other bullshit issue stopping corruption is #1 priorityDo you know how much the University of California cost fifty years ago?    Virtual Free..  (that&#39;s not a number Bernie..)  How much does it cost today?  I don&#39;t know.  - Bernie Sanders  2019Trump just signed the bill that lets Americans go get there scripts in Canada come on why don’t you mention that.Why so short?He so obviously genuinely cares about America and its people. Bernie rules.Please have on Ann Coulter. Thank you.Wow he got BernieThank you for hosting Bernie! If you haven’t watched the vid of Bernie accompanying people with diabetes to Canada to get affordable insulin, then you should. Very powerful; like the Bernie2020 campaign!Idk why everyone freaks out about long wait times at doctors offices. I go to the doctor twice a year MAYBE. Why you guys so goddamn sick? Get your shit together. The only people who should go often are extremely sick people and the elderly. And all those people have are time. That’s a stupid argument.Bernie should just throw in the towel. I&#39;m falling asleep. Also, Joe&#39;s is just letting him ramble non-stop without any sort of challenge. Joe KNOWS about Silicon Valley stashing billions while not paying taxes. He just had Jack Dorsey on his show. What a jib. RidiculousHOW DID I MISS THIS !! New age fucking media is here. Joe Rogan has more outreach than most of these idiot mainstream news shows that are extremely censored and morally corrupt by their corporate owners.&quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot; (2016)<br />&quot;John Howard Hermann, Head Communist Writer : We aren&#39;t even talking about money! We&#39;re talking about economics.&quot;&quot;Interview trump next please you can do it! You can do it all night longif it comes down to trump and bernie ill go w bernie but ideally i would want Andrew Yang to be presidentLove both of these guys.<br />Bernie 2020Bernie&#39;s a old suit:dated, out of place, useless, left behind.Why should Bernie Sanders have 3 houses, when some people have no houses?As a Bernie supporter, I thank you for this interview, Joe. 👍THE ONE PERCENT, OF THE TEN PERCENT, OF THE 45 PERCENT!Following my company raising it&#39;s minimum wage to $15 we saw price increases, hourly cuts, and full time positions eliminated. Just as I predicted. Bernie doesn&#39;t understand economics. He&#39;s a socialist so it&#39;s no surprise.Holy shit I can’t believe this really happened. Feel the bern babyyyyyy 🗳WHY ARE TOP COMMENTS GETTING REMOVE AND REPLACED WITH BULLSHIT ONES .... HMMM SEEMS LEGITYou need tougher and more well thought out questions Joe ! Fix ItWaiting for Joe to pass him the bluntwhat a total pos this corrupt , career politician is . a communist leach that has fed off the tax payer for almost his entire life, and look at  sellout rogan cum in his own pants just seeing him, lol. earth to Bernie....what the fuck have you actually done in your life, you commie bastard, that you think you can run ours? you&#39;re a career politician , the lowest form of life on earth.  TERM LIMITS MR TRUMP , TERM LIMITS!Best Joe Rogan show I&#39;ve seen. Bernie or bust.BERNIE!Shut up Sanders.This is just leftist asmr bedtime stylesThis guy say we were at war with China after Pearl Harbor ?????DUDE!  😍🤸Communist!Bernie 2020!!!!!U fucking sellout.<br />You sold out to the Clinton&#39;s.  They killed Seth Rich.  You could&#39;ve beat Trump, but you sold out.<br />Now you will never become president.He is insane.Joe, I think we should now see a conservative politician, like Ted Cruz, on the podcast as well to talk about the same issues and their approach.Listening to this man talk....like why not give it a try...could it really get any worse??? His head seems in the right placeThe top 1% own the private Federal Reserve.....Bernie doesn&#39;t have the stamina to hold his head up. On that basis alone I prefer Trump. Commander in Chief not ninny nannie in charge.Less than 1/2 of 1/2 of 1/2 of 1/2 of 1/2 of 1/2 of 1% of the population are killed with the use of a RIFLE of any sort in the US every year.   We do not have an &quot;assault weapon&quot; problem in this country we have an inner city gang problem where the vast majority of murders happen every year.  Bernie does not want to deal with that issue though.As a UK citizen,  America is so lucky to have people like Bernie who have spent their whole life fighting for human rights. Wanna swap him for a zip lining chicken clutching  buffoon with bad hair?Damn this is fire long long time cominghow can people in &quot;poverty&quot; afford morbid obesity?69 😂😂I did not expect Bernie to be on here holy shitReality TV show. Great point, I&#39;m glad someday said it?I wish we could get to know every candidate this way.  I love JRE so much for this.  It&#39;s a shame mainstream news doesn&#39;t do this.Free free free already talking about commies UK labor party gives you free time haha go back to Russia and live sell your four mansions go tax rich RussiansA podcast with Joe should be a requirement to be president!!Gets an entire hour and still gives the same 45 second answers just way stretched out.Venezuela“The DNC wants to give everyone a fair chance”. Just like in 2016 Bernie. When Clinton literally stole the dem nomination in lock step with the DNC and Bernie took it up the rear.Get the Trump Train on!Someone get this man a Ricola, damn💯LEGENDARY!!!Debates with pre-planned questions and careful crafted speeches are dead politics.  Long live the Podcast.Joe “Long Forum” RoganWhat&#39;s with the dislike bar?Wow, 4 Presidential candidates if I can remember correctly. Gary John, Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, and now Bernie Sanders.This. This is good shit.Comparing the United States to <i>any</i> other country is completely nonsensical. The US is entirely unique, and stands alone on the global stage. Why would the most free and prosperous country in the history of the world take notes from the countries that people fled from to create the US in the first place?Yeah but......you ever try to change the healthcare system on DMT?Fucking socialist pig,rot in hell  douche bagWe went to war with Japan, Bernie. At least you didn&#39;t say Toledo.Bernie only allotting one hour for THE JOE ROGAN SHOW really shows how much he misunderstands America today... This is a monumental moment in modern history and he failed to treat it as such...Banning assault rifles is undermining the constitution. How can you protect yourself from government tyranny when you can not equip yourself with the guns used by the military. Communists always take away the guns.bernie is literally the realest-ass dude in politics in a long, long timeSocialism Marxism Communism, responsible for 100 million deaths in the 20th century alone.HEALTHCARE MONOPOLIES UP HERE IN CANADA.  YEAR LONG WAITS.  DON&#39;T DO IT!Canada&#39;s medical systems a joke. Socialism doesn&#39;t work folks.Hey free health care is fucking stupid and so is socialism but having Bernie on is pretty coolThis is the most depressing JRE I&#39;ve ever seen. This guy will not be voted for.This is the real Democratic debate.I have zero respect for Bernie. If he lived by his words then I would maybe have one iota of respect for him. He clearly doesn&#39;t know economics nor does he live by his word. He wants to tax you to death while he pays little to no taxes. He also wasn&#39;t paying his workers 15 a hour. He pays them salary and cut their hours when it got out he was paying them under $15 a hour. He&#39;s a fuckin jokeThis commie hates America.Sounds great who’s going to pay for all the free stuff we wants to give out? Oh wait the tax payers which means taxes will get raised. Also not to mention that the wait time to see a doctor in countries with free healthcare is significantly longer then in America. I do respect him for coming on Joe’s podcast glad he did more candidates should do so!Conservatives in the comment section don&#39;t know the difference between democratic socialism and socialism. soaking up too much fox news puppets for profit.The ONLY time joe challenged was when Bernie said he wasn’t a fan of pot.You have great ideas Bernie. When you call Trump racist, no one believes you. You have good ideas but youre blaming others.bernie wouldnt&#39;t legalize weed, he wouldnt have health care for all get that through your thick skulls. huge corporations run the shit not the presidentI really enjoyed this.  I hadn’t taken Bernie seriously until I really listened to everything he said.  I believe he has this down pat.  I would vote for him.  I hope he gets his message out and more people take him seriously.  Good job Joe.Canadians come to the US in droves for health care because the waiting times are so long for life-saving treatments and surgical procedures in Canada.When career college students can’t find work. They become Senator Sanders.Jesus, I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s only 4 years older than Trump and one year older than biden. He almost looks like he could be their father.<br />I don&#39;t mean to sound cruel but he looks horrible for his age. To the point where I&#39;m not confident he&#39;d live out a term.DNC lobbyist are pissed joe did this for freeThe argument about the top 1% and the 90% is an absolute bull ship tired out argument.<br /><br />It&#39;s nothing but empty rhetoric.<br /><br />The people in the vast majority of the so called 1%, the workaholics and they bust their ass providing jobs to millions so they can provide food on the table for their families.<br /><br />This is not a question of equal outcome, it&#39;s equal opportunity.<br /><br />Everybody is going to have a situation where therye on the winning side at times and the losing side at times.<br /><br /> there will always be people that have more than others.<br /><br /> As far as the so called poor in this country Khama the average poor person has way more money and their standring living is way better than it has ever been in history. As the wealthy get wealthier, the poor also get wealthier even if it&#39;s not as wealthy in contrast to the you eat rich they&#39;re comparing to.<br /><br />An average poor home today has multiple TV&#39;s, a refrigerator, plumbing, supercomputer smartphones in their pocket, access to the Internet and so on.<br /><br />What we call poor country...poor people have never had it so well in the history of the world.<br /><br /> Poor people today live many times better than the richest aristocrat was capable of living 2 centuries ago.<br /><br />Is he really going to sit there and say there wasn&#39;t haves and have nots in Communist Russia or any socialistic nations? Those that control the system are always at the top.<br /><br />If you live in the United States, guess what? You&#39;re in the top 1% of the entire world.<br /><br />What passes off for poor in the United States is luxury living by the standards of almost anywhere else in the entire planet.<br /><br />It is such a bullshit narrative to try to push the divisive politics of the so called 1% and the 90%, it is nothing but pushing and breeding hatred, contempt and jealousy.<br /><br />It&#39;s not telling people what can they do to be productive and to join among the ranks of those that were able to create a well producing life for themself, no...instead it&#39;s about breeding jealousy and telling people that they absolutely without question must have been screwed because they&#39;re not as wealthy as others, even though those people didn&#39;t make the same life decisions of these others, so they must figure out a way to screw over these people and take what they had rather than rightfully earning it as they should.<br /><br />It is absolutely low hanging fruit, and people who don&#39;t want to put the work in will always love to hear from so called leaders that are willing to tell them they haven&#39;t made any poor life decisions and they are nothing but a victim abd should be able to take from those who have worked hard.<br /><br /> It&#39;s a tactic that&#39;s been going on for centuries.<br />The victim industry is huge.<br /><br />I wonder how Joe would respond if Sanders started pointing out how large his Podcast building was, and then proclaiming that Joe doesn&#39;t need it all and those on the street outside and  should be able to rightfully come in and start taking what they need from Joe, because after all ...no man needs all of these possessions...<br />Right joe?<br /> People have a right to bear and keep the fruits of their labor, and I am so sick of people capitalizing and exploiting the hard work of other people for cheap votes and doing nothing but breeding contempt and hatred by those who refuse or not willing to work, against those who do.&quot;we need a government that controls companies and prices. you don&#39;t need the ability to lobby your government, you need education and healthcare we provide and control&quot;  - This guy works for the queen of england.Bernie is obviously inoculated by Marxist doctrine. The reason the USA is the richest and most powerful Nation is because we haven’t done what he wants to do. He wants to make America poor.In Australia there are different minimum wages for teenaged compared to adults. A 15 year olds min wage is different to a 18 year old and again a 21 year olds is higher.Bernie sanders 😂😂😂 wtf is thisThis dude is lying thru his teeth.Health care can’t be a human right. A right cannot be dependent on someone else serving you. No one has the right to a doctors care; or someone else’s money so they can get a doctors care. Canada’s public health care is garbageWho went bigtimeYes! Finally!!! Thank you, Joe and Bernie!And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CNN">#CNN</a>/Google calling the shots,  look at Jimmy dore been posting.Doesnt matter what your political opinion is, Joe deserves respect for having such important conversations. Thank you JoeSocialismGive him a joint Joe maybe he&#39;ll tell where the aliens are🍻He is bought by big pharmaCome on Joe ask him about his f*<b>***</b> over his staff and about being a part of the 1%1) All American soldiers should be recalled and stationed at our borders (no wall necessary).<br />2) No oil should ever be imported. <br />3) Fracking should be immediately banned. <br />4) Marijuana should be taxed and regulated like alcohol. <br />5) Income tax should be eliminated.<br />6) The tax code should be reduced to one paragraph or less.<br />7) Religious institutions should be immediately stripped of tax exemptions. <br />8) Art, gym and music should be after school activities, not mandatory curriculum. <br />9) Summer break should be reduced to one month.<br />10) All teachers tenures should be immediately revoked. <br />11) The New York Giants/Jets should get the fuck out of New Jersey. <br />12) Big Pharma should be held accountable for it&#39;s deception. <br />13) America should not provide any aid to foreign countries. <br />14) America should dump Puerto Rico and cut off all aid to the island.  <br />15) Google should stop censoring American Citizens.<br />16) Bert Kreischer should stop being fat.<br />17) Michael Jackson should stop pretending to be Michelle Pfeiffer.<br />18) People who demand reparations should get them in the form of a free boat ride home.I’m still a little confused. What a yuhman right?We have been blowing up other countries and rebuilding them since Vietnam. It is time for a revolution of thought, and it&#39;s time to rebuild the United States. <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/smr/federal-budget/2019/03/12/heres-the-breakdown-of-the-pentagons-budget-request/">https://www.defensenews.com/smr/federal-budget/2019/03/12/heres-the-breakdown-of-the-pentagons-budget-request/</a>Bern, look at the SUN. It not only affects our climate, it affects our weather, in ways that make human causes insignificant. That said, pollution is bad and that does affect us.<br /><br />Just stop with the settled science bit. That is a contradiction in terms.Get in, Rogan finally got a lefty on.Was waiting for this episodeTelevised &quot;debates&quot; are nonsense. They encourage identity politics and style over substance.You are paid according to your contribution.  Period🔥🔥🔥Too many ads. <br /><br />Contradicts sentiments (of both Joe and Bernie) exprrssed in this video.Someone remind comrade Bernie that most mass shootings are committed in gun-free zones in the cities with strict gun laws. Most killings with firing arms are suicide related and gang related.Australia has a $18.93 minimum wage and there unemployment rates is 5%, ours is 3.8% (which is admittedly slightly better). Is a 1.2% difference in unemployment worth it?if you pay someone to flip burgers $15/hour instead of 9$/hour, first of all, the burger will not get flipped AND your burger will cost 15$ instead of 9$ AND the business will go under AND all the jobs will be lost. The ONLY companies that could afford to pay &quot;living&quot; wages are the ones that are already hyper-efficient, E.G. AMAZON... incentivizing people to stay in minimum paying jobs for life is truly pure slavery and will ruin the country.Well let’s see if he has Ron Paul on now.......You can’t buy a gun without a background check in any state at a gun showHis head&#39;s sinking into his damn chest cavityWow. Crazy. Bernie in JRE! Hi mom!If they canceled student debt, I better see a check in the mail for the 10 years of monthly payments I made in order to pay off my student loans.I was interested in what he had to say till it got to about gun control and banning guns<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m32s">47:32</a> when you get drunk and remember you have that 1/2 pound in the trunk.lmao already 4k dislikes, trump&#39;s rabid cultist fanbase is shitting bricks to brigade the comments and manipulate the votecount here, as usualMedicare for everyone<br />Free college for everyone<br />Free stuff for endless illegals<br />Just a few days ago Bernie said himself that they will have to increase taxes on the middle class<br />No kidding<br />Why is he surprised that conservatives think of him as coming for their money?The burn huh? Let’s see this shitHEALTHCARE IS NOT A RIGHT! You cant FORCE someone to spend their time and labor.So basically are military is run the same way as are healthcare <br />Lobbyists.This is honestly the first time I ever sat and really listened to Mr.Sanders.Ol crazy BernieCapitalism, socialism, putting it all aside...<br /><br />The rich who own all the world’s major industries wield an obscene amount of influence, and unless people organize in a way that gives them some similar influence, the mega rich will have the power to mostly do what they want without input from society at large. If that’s what Bernie is prescribing, I think he’s absolutely correct. It isn’t about free college or healthcare or any kind of policy. It’s about the cold politics of power and our democracy is undeniably disempowered.I dont understand why so many people hate on Bernie...Bernie this is how you win.I&#39;m not a supporter of Bernie&#39;s plans but I like to listen to people and this is the only reason I&#39;m listening to a man who&#39;s lived a long and interesting life I do not hate Bernie Sanders I do not think he is a stupid person I just believe our types of politics don&#39;t match but this will be interestingYou&#39;d have to pass legislation to force the network&#39;s to air what you told them to air and for how long. Hmmmmm didn&#39;t the Soviet union do that and China still does.Who is Bernie Sanders?  The racist guy that called Baltimore a third world country a few years ago?  I heard it&#39;s beautiful now.I still feel the bern!What these guys dont seem to mention is that to be the number one economy with the best innovation you have to let people make money. It works for canada becuase they dont have to innovate we do the innovatingWished he was was challenged more, sounded a lot like a bunch of sound bitesPersonal antidote I live in a despaired area.

To blame the gun is to be accepting of a deranged society.Joe Rogan for president! Regardless of what your political stance is, Joe Rogan is The G.O.A.T. for this interview!Each candidate could just upload a youtube video explaining their policies. Tv is useless.Joe, please have a few guys on to have a debate. Buttigeg, yang and bernie would be amazingThis guy is so full of shit his eyes are dark brownWho is Bernie Sanders?  The racist guy that called Baltimore a third world country a few years ago?  I heard it&#39;s beautiful now.Gigantic waste of my hour. Love it. A true political figure. Didn&#39;t answer a single question.Bernie Sanders scrapping for votes doing podcast lmao. If Trump had to stoop this low he’d get ripped apart. Oh Bernie you are pathetic buddy. Just say free everythingBernie you&#39;re dismissing the backbone of the American economy: small local businesses. How is the mom and pop shop supposed to afford a couple helpers at $15 an hour? I&#39;m all for a better wage, but I&#39;m pretty certain $10-$12 would be fair. Does it make life easy? No but at $12 an hour I&#39;m not entirely worried about food in my belly.The US has a disgraceful healthcare system. Crazy that a first World country operates this way. The US citizen needs to understand that healthcare is a right. In the UK the NHS is an important part of the country. Can&#39;t imagine living without it.Sanders for President!Oh shit.I wish he&#39;d asked about election fraud and/or Seth Rich. Other than that great interview. Maybe there were certain topics Joe was told to stay away from in order to get Bernie to agree to come on. I don&#39;t know. A bit disappointed, though.Its amazing how fast people forgot that he not only stood by and did nothing when scammed by Hillary.  He told you to support her. Now you praise him.  Fuck these puppets.So bernie is gonna go full DNC and rip off Yang?Look, crazy socialist who doesn&#39;t understand nearly all his talking points will destroy the Americsn economy.<br /><br />Bernie sounds no more cogent in long form than in 4 second sounds bytes.<br /><br />But good job getting him on your show, Joe.Portugal. <br />they fixed it.<br />legal but you need to talk to a counselor first.I literally!! just talked to <i>_________</i> last night.Fox CNN. Joe you should moderate the damn debates. Three hours at dive deep policy discussion between Sanders Gabbard YangWhy is health care a basic human right.Bernie &quot;I&#39;m a Dictator I love Dictators&quot; SandersThis only reinforced my negative opinion of Bernie. But props to Joe for having him on.so who pays for medical bill in Canada 🇨🇦Joe, don’t break when politicians cone to you and offer you tons of money to have this amount of exposure for “ free “ .The Corrupt are in complete control.<br />And we...WE...the people gave it to them through our apathy, we sold ourselves out.Sad only 1 hour.Windsor Ontario in the building! 519 Lego!Good for having him on Joe, I&#39;d like to see a lot more candidates talk on your show even if I disagree with 110% of what they have to say.Lol he&#39;s going through every democratic candidate and doing an hour talk show with themstop saying white terrorists are mentally ill. they are almost all, NOT. bernie needs to point out, if we ban assault rifles, YES, hundreds of millions of assault rifles will indeed still be out there, but possession will be illegal. SO, if found, they are taken, and arrests are made. right now without the law, it is not a chargeable offense. with the pump shut off for these guns, they will slowly go down, and not UP. stings will be made. people will be tempted to make a lot of cash trying to sell them black market style. collections will get impounded. some people will hide them, to the point of being relatively useless.What in the actual fuck!I can&#39;t wait to come back in a few days and read the comments! Thank you Joe!&quot;guy who soaks blows to the head for a living interviews guy who deals them out&quot;AmazingA dumpster pumper and a jew with strange sexual habitsYour health care you want to put in law will take away employee provided healthcare why have the government take over healthcare there terrible at everything already. I like my healthcareJust want everyone to know Bernie is openly a Communist. Just sayin&#39;.too shortAs a avid hunter all I need is a bow the only thing is I don’t trust the fu##### government   <br />No one does and shouldn’t !!!!!!I’m only half way through and have two big complaints. If you forgive student loan debt, you should also pay back people who where able to pay for college through there parents or their own finances. That is only fair, as the people who did pay and not go into debt, also did not get great jobs. Second compliant is that Bernie is using semantics for the gun control argument using “assault style weapons”. That was a made up, ignorant term used by people who do not understand what a semi-automatic gun with a pistol grip looks like. I’m all for magazine size regulation and outlawing bump stocks and beta mags, but get your facts straight. I respected and trusted Bernie, but his use of hyperbole in this podcast was too much.The government is extremely inefficient at everything it has control over. Perhaps LESS government is the answer?Have I just entered a bizarre lucid dream... or did this really happen? 😂awesome!!!!! can&#39;t wait to watch this!!! gotta getto workTax on stock transaction and tax on the gain.... ok fuck uHis opinion on minimum wage increase is entirely one-sided. He missed few points:<br />1) A lot of businesses will become not cost effective after you raise it and it doesn&#39;t matter if everyone has the same condition, it will not make it cost effective to hire people. It will incentivize replacing workers with machines.<br />2) It almost wouldn&#39;t affect places  like big cities  where cost of living is high enough that everyone earns more then minimum wage, while it will affect places like small cities where cost of living is low enough that minimum wage can be considered viable( example from US is Puerto Rico where after implementation of minimum wage unemployment rose very high, this is source - <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/puerto-rico-hurt-most-by-the-federal-minimum-wage)">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/puerto-rico-hurt-most-by-the-federal-minimum-wage)</a><br />3) It wouldn&#39;t affect big businesses who can afford to pay they employees more and sustain themselves as much as it will affect startups and small businesses who can&#39;t do that, so from one angle minimum wage increase can be considered profitable for big established businesses who will have less competition to worry aboutJoe Rogan is a tool, he’s changed positions more than Deon Sanders. Any man who can’t stand for himself will bow to anyone who signs his check.If you ban &quot;assault&quot; rifles do the millions of unregistered ones just disappear?The 2nd amendment was about slave owners making sure their slaves didn&#39;t over power them. Had nothing to do with the British. Didnt work during the war of 1812 anyways.Joe Rogan I love you brother but you should be asking hard questions you lettuce fuckboy come on your show employee the Airways<br />Get realTrump 2020 USA 🇺🇸  🦅Bernie is really trying now isn&#39;t he?  He knows that he&#39;s full of crap but he&#39;s trying to look cool and hip.  If there&#39;s anybody that seems to have a bit of sensibility, it&#39;s Tulsi Gabbard.Bernie had no good answers about what raising the minimum wage would do to our economy. How to stop drug cartels and how in the hell would a gun ban work when there are so many in circulation already not to mention gangs will make huge money off of black market gun salesBernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard are the most genuine presidential candidatesGo ahead Bernie... ban the &quot;assault weapons&quot;... I wish you would...Did anyone address WikiLeak?The issue is deeper then just people lacking jobs.. its also a lack off values, strong families and kids playing videogames all day. Its to easy to blame it all on the government and wealth gappOnly took 46 minutes to ask about pot 🤙So refreshing to listen to an honest politicianThis would have been worth watching if you had brought on Molyneux too.Why does bernies security walk around with automatic machines guns? He obviously doesn&#39;t practice what he preaches. Same as paying his help 15 bucks an hr.He paid Joe to come on and spill his garbage to the centerist. Fuck off, commie.All emotional antidotal evidence to support his views and no real facts.  Propaganda pusher!Bernie spoke to a lot of fucken people last night....He&#39;s had Yang and Tulsi on and  both were interesting conversations that gave me much better perspective. It would be great to have Trump on...but I&#39;m sorry Bernie has not got a chance<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=20m47s">20:47</a> “just talked to a young college woman <b>clears throat</b> last night” ;)))))This episode should be named Bernie wanders.<br />Man, the boredom ... I´m doneRemember when Bernie was a radical?Yeah joe <br />Get Mitch on the show and have him answer some critical questionsComplete lies about gun shows.....  what an asshole... same background check for each sale at everyone of the gun shows...FAKE NEWS!!!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m16s">27:16</a> is when Bernie exposes he doesn’t have any answers at all.Only stupid people believes that this old-ass vulture cares about the poors.How is a small business, just starting up going to afford $30000 per person on labor? If you raise the minimum wage your just going to make it better for large corporations because small businesses won&#39;t be able to compete400 million guns yet they aren&#39;t jumping up and shooting our 346+ million citizens. Seems like guns are not the problem..<br /><br />Also, background checks already exists, they already check for domestic violence ECT. You would need access to a person&#39;s medical record, which is a violation of the HIPPA act.The guy is senile. But at least you’re giving everyone a shot to speak, and at the very least I believe everyone should have that chance.Wtf Joe? You work for Bernie now? This is worse than the interview with Jack Dorsey. Can we get some fact checking in here, Jamie?The amount of people who think Bernie is anti establishment is unbelievable. Bernie is no different than any other puppet politician <br />While you&#39;re at it, look up the &quot;audit the fed&quot; bill and how Bernie voted against it 👍🏻😀<br />Btw<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YANG2020">#YANG2020</a>It&#39;s nice to hear someone actually explain their policies in a somewhat comprehensive manner. He cleared up his actual healthcare policy. Not even remotely like the propaganda I&#39;ve heard.Bernie really didn’t want to talk about the minimum wage for people under 18 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=21m15s">21:15</a>Joe has now interviewed the only Democrats worth voting for: Bernie, Tulsi, and YangI wonder if Joe blazed bowl with good ole Bern around? I wouldJoe &quot; plotting to become Bernie&#39;s V.C. to assassinate him gaining ultimate primal power to appease D.M.T spirits&quot; Rogan.Get Phil Anselmo to your podcast, he has the greatest storys!Can&#39;t wait for JRE toons of this interview!That’s crazy, man. Have you ever tried Metamucil before?Bernie vague as fuck on the gun issue<br />I heard no solutions there AT ALLJoe for president!no matter the topic, socialism big government and the erosion of personal rights are not the answer.Bernie is a fraudthis man bowed down and kissed the ring of HRC...smhYou know I hope you fucks do get medicare for all, just so I can fucking cackle at all the people surprised at things not improving, or even decline, despite all the &quot;rich&quot; people making 6 figures get taxed to an early fucking grave. Trump&#39;ll get blamed even if he&#39;s not in office.I would have liked to see more opposition and critical discussion about some of Bernie&#39;s opinions and plans. Is it just me or did it seem like Bernie just used this as a platform and it wasn&#39;t an actual conversation.Joe, the &quot;strategy of unlimited growth&quot; is directly correlated with the REQUIREMENT of exponential DEBT MONEY GROWTH that the current system needs in order to sustain itself!!!There’s mass shootings nearly every week in Chicago. And you say it’s gang members killing other gang members so it’s not as bad?? I thought black lives mattered!&quot;the only major country that doesn&#39;t guarantee health care&quot; Bernie should check out China sometime.Hot damn the variety of comments on this video is insane. So funny to see some reasonable discussion, both for and against. All mixed in 50/50 with crazy ramblings of people that seem to know how exactly to fix this country, again both for and against. Biggest dumpster fire of comment section jre has had in a while I think<b>WARNING</b> LOTS OF TRIGGERED PEOPLE IN COMMENTS <b>WARNING</b>this is the president america needsWhat is so hard to understand the culture of America is and will always be capitalism which is libertarian competition as opposed to socialism which is authoritarian cooperation.<br /><br />our purpose as American is to compete is to fight we didn&#39;t like the taxes the British gave us so we fought them we didn&#39;t like racism so we thought ourselves we didn&#39;t like the Nazis so we fought them we&#39;ve competed for years.<br /><br />competition is what we are it&#39;s why we have the most advanced in medicine  to cure diseases not possible without competition.<br /><br /> it is our inalienable right life liberty property and to pursue happiness not to be given happiness by the government by stealing from other citizens.<br /><br />in nature there are winners and losers some animals die some animal survive we cannot force everyone to live without taking from others and forcing cooperation stealing wealth from successful citizens there are not enough resources to save everyone in the world to heal everyone in the world to feed everyone in the world your communist Utopia doesn&#39;t make poor people Rich it makes everyone poor<br /> there is no government in all of human history that did not have poorThe worst of these are you reading talking points. Instead of being you, it turns into a promotion. You talking to guests is the format I like and this wasn&#39;t it.Holy. Shit.What.The entire healthcare industry is corrupt.  Bernie is not going to fix it.<br />Only the strong pursuit of justice against the criminals will solve it.<br />Notice what he said in just the first 5 to 10 minutes of this interview. <br />Bernie will fold under the same pressure he is talking about.<br />Bad people are involved, and they need to be dealt with, period.Very weak interview. Didnt press him on anything or question him on raising everyones taxes. Gave him a free ad, that&#39;s aboit it.fantastic last question Joe!But I like corporations, the media and a few multi-billionaires conditioning me to be a worker antBernie &quot;What I&#39;m sayin&#39; about&quot; SandersBernie needs to run as Tulsis VPIt will be fun to see all of trump&#39;s insane cultists shit their pants over thisLmao what was up with Joe’s last questionBernie is a peoples&#39; man. Can see him becoming POTUS soon. Hopefully Corbyn can come to power here in the UK as well.These professionals politicians don’t even live in reality anymore all of their ideas are fed to them from lunatic advisors who crave only power.  Listening to this man say we aren’t great and we need to redefine what makes us great makes me sick.  I’m not a billionaire and I love this country it is by far the greatest on the planet.  The impoverished will never rise shitty parents raise shitty kids the cycle can only be broken through morals and virtue long gone from the liberal victim hood that is pushed by the democrats.  They are the ones keeping minority’s and poor people down.  Which serves to keep them in office.  They scream to the poor it’s not your fault vote for me and we can change.  8 years of Clinton 8 years of Obama 8 years of Bush not one step forward.  A politician can’t make lazy people motivated, stupid people smart or poor people rich.  It is a lie and always has been.  At least Trump is making a America first economy were if you want to improve your life there is a chance.  Unless you live in a sanctuary city then there is no hope.Joe: conservative misconception &quot;you are gonna take their money&quot;<br />Bernie: side step.<br />Truth: TAXDid anyone notice at 38 minutes in Bernie talks about the nz shooting... He says THEY moved pretty quickly and aggressively!!!! They? We were told there was one shooter 🤔!!!?Rules for Thee, But not for BernieBut doctors make at least 150, 000 a yr...Top comments are being buried and censored - colour me shocked...Not gonna watch. I just hope Joe had the balls to ask him how much he made from endorsing Hilary at the end of his run.Ross gave 100 million to trump 2020? Who’s Who?The military doesn&#39;t use an AR15... it&#39;s a fucking toy compared to military grade weapons. Claiming an AR15 is an assault rifle only shows you have no knowledge on the subject.What the fuck?! Bernie fucking Sanders! On Rogan?! I&#39;m definitely high but this is real lolYou think socializing health care will lower the price?The fist rule is no match for Bernie&#39;s voice.How will schools handle the influx of applicants and student attendance? Won&#39;t that create a situation of a shortage of schools and quality teachersSmoke that weed Bernie!Wow just clicked on and auto like by YouTube had to change it my self.assault weapon ban starting in &#39;94 actually showed an increase in crime according to the FBI. But lets just ignore that.I like how Bernie didn&#39;t address pesticides on marijuana... Good showI&#39;m from the UK and know little about US politics, but this chap seems sound enoughWhat is Bernie looking at the whole time?I share many of his sentiments, but few of his solutions.Respect the hell outta you Joe - BUT- This is worse than Jack Dorsey pt 1.  <br /><br />Exactly what is an assault weapon Bernie?<br />Where’s Tim Pool when you need him...sheesh.Not a Bernie fan but good to watchI&#39;m on the side of Bernie but the people who just &#39;got a degree&#39; did so without a lick of thought about what they wanted to do in life.oh boy Joe actually did it! this comment section is going to be a warzone lmaoBernie, introduce a modern homestead actThank fuck this asshole isn&#39;t presidentYou know the microphone comes to you Bernie you don&#39;t have to stoop,I tried, just can&#39;t watch ol Bernie. Good to have him on though. Now you gotta get Trump on 😀👍young people don&#39;t need to work, college &amp; healthcare are going to be freeA high school degree is not good enough now. I call BS. I have never taken any college classes ever. I make over 100k a year by working hard and doing what needs to be done. People need to learn to work. College isn&#39;t the answer for everyone.scientists do not agree on the cause of climate change. They all agree that the climate changes. They do not agree that it is co2 emissions from humans that cause it. This is easy information to find for yourself.A lot of Bernie’s plans aren’t going to pass... But he’s definitely a better option than any other Dem, Or trump. I’ve yet to really consider the Republican nominees. Gotta wait and see what they’re about. Chances are I see it being more like Beto, lobbiest as fuck.Bernie Sanders is an interesting candidate, however he is just not the best candidate in the race.Oh boy I can’t wait for the memes!!So I just listened to the entire podcast and I can agree with Bernie about the problems facing this country.  I will say however he offers very little in how to fix it besides saying we will implement this and that.  Where does all this money come from?  A country that is already trillions in debt.Bernie, get fucked.If Bernie can&#39;t handle a 3 hour show with Joe Rogan then he&#39;s not ready to become president.It&#39;s too late for Bernie to win but god bless him. This podcast reignited my flameAre these videos still streamed live???Not radical ideas at allThat&#39;s how the wage works in australia your wage goes up every year until you turn 21 and each state has different minimum wages all around $15I remember when Joe had a green screen and doing this in his home. Now look where he’s at. Has people from all walks of life and with different job and views. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23powerful">#powerful</a>Am I the only one slightly irritated that Bernie doesn&#39;t look at the person hes talking to?<br />On the side note <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a>Thank you for having Bernie on. And thank you for having had Dr. Cornel West on, not so long ago. We need more channels uplifting voices that speak the truth, and who care about the working class and the poor.Joe is such a hoe though300,000 dollar debt. Great incentive for medical students... and they want you to mortgage and they want you to pay for private healthcare... Jesus America, I thought U.K. was broken.All them decades Bernie has been in government and somehow he allowed all of this to happen, and now he wants to fix it? Hmmm, sounds rather status quoWhy do we blame guns in mass shootings but blame cops when they&#39;re involved in a shooting?<br /><br />This is a mental problem and a drug problem.And how much money do you have Bernie? You&#39;re part of the 1% you&#39;re a liar and a fraudBernie you ideals are so unrealistic. You’re a fucking clown! If minimum wage goes up the price of everything else goes up so basically crossing each other out. Trump 2020So, everyone Bernie talks too was just last night.I want to thank you Joe for bringing Bernie Sanders to your show.🤣i can&#39;t wait to see this!In the UK we have a single payer healthcare system (called the NHS) - don’t listen to the politicians that tell you Medicare for All isn’t possible coz it is - like Bernie says, look at all other major countries. Look at your neighbour Canada, you can have it too. Please do yourselves a favour and take care of your health. ❤️Listening to him... so many raised flags... anyway, good thing Joe got him to talk.if they stop selling fuel what do i do with my car? do i get some kind of refund? or do i have a 30 000 dollar paper weight nowBurnie 2020Bernie talking to Joe about how corrupt wealthy people are. Oh the irony. Hahaha.TULSI GABBARD next!!! Lets do it Joe Hogan!FOH<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AndrewYang2020">#AndrewYang2020</a> is Still top contender for those that have a modicum of intelligence.A Bernie/Yang ticket would be a dream come true. It would be like winning the lottery on common sense.Why don&#39;t instead of becoming socialist the government go after the drug and insurance companies?<a href="http://www.yang2020.com/">www.yang2020.com</a><br /><br />Andrew Yang is running for president with a common message of Humanity First. His centrepiece is the Freedom Dividend, a $1000 a month dividend given to every citizen starting at age 18. Imagine what it would mean for yourself and for your community if all the sudden millions were pumped into it. It would start reviving these dying stores that companies like Amazon are putting out of business. It would take the financial boot of the throat of millions of Americans and truly alive them to live rather than just survive.The American people arent interested in democratic socialism. I&#39;m not interested in shredding the edges of the Constitution to make 1% of the population happy. Bernie is another millionaire shill mascarading as a change agent. He&#39;s just as crooked as the rest of the politicians. Absolute garbage.Bernie is so stupid he sees no consequence of forcing 15 dollar an hour minimum wages and yet he doesn&#39;t even pay his own staff thatI served in the USN for the ability to earn my G.I. Bill, which pays for my school.  I dedicated half a decade of my life for this cause.  If Student debt is wiped, if school becomes free, which is a boon to all in the long run, what worth does my G.I. Bill still have?Minimum wage in my country is 1$ a dayBernie said we promised kids good paying jobs when they get out of college, and now they are in debt and theres no jobs... the solution? Send everyone to college to get those jobs, that didnt exist for a smaller number of people.Each candidate gets locked in a podcast studio with another candidate and Young Jamie. Presidential thunderdome.Feel the motherfucking bern!!!!What is the answer and solution to these mass shootings??? It seems to be a trend of crazy young men outraged by society. Why??? Frustated women on the other hand don&#39;t do these kind of mass shootings. How do we stop these boys from going crazy and help them and nurture them back to health and mental stability??? Should be the question... Like suicide prevention hot lines may be not a bad idea to have support hot lines for young boys and men. Just seems logical to help someone that hurt anyone but, I&#39;m not from this fucked up planet. So oh well lolLets get to the real issue here Bernie.....Who stole your neck?Doesn&#39;t know shit about guns hahaThe average age of McDonalds employees is 20. Fact.I wish the $15 hr minimum wage was a good thing and everybody could get more money and everything would just be all hunky-dory but if this were to happen it would drive more businesses out of the country. It would drive up the cost of goods and services and it would shut some businesses down. It would further drive the push to replace workers with robots, kiosks, etc.  It would drive up the unemployment rate, in turn, hurting the economy and the crime rate would go up.We need to get rid of the debates and just let each candidate talk with Joe for 2 hoursIsn’t t pronounced agenda not agender? 😂Only an hour!?If you get paid $7.25 an hour you can afford college because you get grants! I got denied financial aid making $12.50 an hour cause my wife at the time made $9.00 and we owned our own house.Hahaha the 👽 question at the endJoe Rogan Podcast Debate!Bernie has a good heart but his ideas aren&#39;t feasible.Good thing we beat China in World War II Bernie........Have trump on broImage the same guy that created the area 51 raid makes a second raid with the goal to eliminate Trump, they cant kill us all!The issue on increasing the minimum wage is that other citizens don’t think you deserve it. They don’t believe you should be able to live off an entry level job. You see it all over comment sections. It’s ridiculous you make companies pay their fair share (not 0) and use that money to subsidize the small businesses.NAZBOL GANGGANG SPENCER NAGEL 2020!!!!!! STRASSERITEAMIRITE?You make me want to vomit <br />So you&#39;re saying if I&#39;m drinking a beer come up with my own idea to make a company that scan prospered millions of people across the country you&#39;re going to text the s*** out of me go fuc yourselfI would love it it Joe did a podcast for each candidate, that would be far better and more helpful for voters than debates.Bernie is covering up UFOs. This whole thing is a scam.He wants to raise minimum wage so he can tax 50% of itRenato Laranga for California Governor ! 👏👏👏👏Keep your hands off my stuff.&quot;I believe in the second amendment&quot; <br /><br />hahahahahahahahaha  So let&#39;s punish the 99.9999% for what the .00001% does. By that logic can we blame all Muslims for 9/11 or all blacks for gang violence? Or does this only apply to legal gun owners who have never broken a law. <br /><br />The assault weapon ban didn&#39;t lower gun deaths, it didn&#39;t work. The gun ban in the UK and Australia only led to record knife deaths. The UK is experiencing record stabbing deaths since 1946. <br /><br />He preaches about the horror while having praised Communist dictators who slaughtered their citizens after disarming them.Joe really needed to have Tim Pool&#39;s hat on to ask the right questions.Molon labe Bernie...molon labe.Instead of increasing the minimum wage and causing millions of people to lose their jobs, how about doing something about low skilled immigrants that have been undercutting American wages for decades?&quot;You have to pass legislation to make that happen.&quot;we have 15 million assault rifles in the US. 10 of them have been used by crazies but the rest of us need to pass background checks? How about instead if your on psych meds you automatically go on a no gun ownership list. That cuts these tragedies by 50-60%. It also appears that 90% of these tragedies were committed by those on the left so maybe Democrats should also be banned from owning guns.ASK BERNIE WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM FOR ALL HIS FREE SHIT.<br /><br /><br />OH, AND ASK HIM WHY HE THINKS WHITE PEOPLE &quot;DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT IT&#39;S LIKE TO BE POOR&quot;I have heard &quot;in other county&#39;s&quot; like 63 times? wtf?? your awesome Bernie but Come on??I started watching JRE for MMA interviews and now I&#39;m watching podcasts with Elon Musk, Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Bernie Sanders. I feel I&#39;ve gotten smarter just bingeing on JRE.Healthcare is not a human right because it&#39;s dependent on the labor of others. <br /><br />You can&#39;t force people to do something. <br /><br />Ask NHS nurses the last time they got a raise.YOUTUBE JUST PUSHED THE LIKES ON THE VIDEO BY 4K INSTANTLY!Free college will make a degree worthlessI can&#39;t wait to vote for this man.If trump was on here it would be trending #1 for weeksThey pay zero in taxes because China doesn’t make their big companies pay taxes.  If we made amazon pay taxes ,  they would just pack there bags and go to China and take the jobs with themJoe should have his own presidential debateMoney is a myth. It only means something cause we allow ourselves to make it mean something. Human just need to get there heads out there asses and start caring about each other. WE ARE A FUCKIN PIECE OF SAND IN THE OCEAN.Old sandy presents a lot of problems without a whole lot of solutionsI was literally dreaming for this podcast 😍😊You cant compare the canada single payer system, we have so many more ppl,the waiting list to see a specialist is <a href="http://months.rich/">months.rich</a> Canadian ppl come here. Also for very expensive medical care you have to. Meet alot of stipulations, for transplant surgery and so <a href="http://forth.so/">forth.so</a> you cant base our health care system to CanadasOk, so raise minimum wage , and lower health care cost ... entry level health care workers cost $$$ to get vetted , licensed &amp; trained all before they even are able to be a worker who&#39;s work even benefits the patients or clinic. Ignore the fact that better than 1/2 of overhead cost is Labor ! How does the proprietor pay utilities , make upgrades / updates to equipment , pay for facility up keep ,  pay for property &amp; malpractice insurance , the list goes on .... ? The math does not add up.That’s my problem with Bernie. He highlights how corrupt politicians are to blame for today’s problems, yet Bernie has been a politician pretty much his whole life.KEANU REEVESNotice the table is missing the wild shit🤔Dave Chappelle should be the Mediator for any political debate!! Especially if Joe Rogan  hosted it on his show!You can smell his desperation.<br />Go away Bernie. You&#39;re part of the problem.How can you not like Bernie?? He’s the most consistent on the issues.Why is he only here for an hour? Doesn&#39;t he realize that this show will have more impact then ANY OTHER program he&#39;s on? Lol, should be here for the full 3 and get loose with some herb and alcohol.... Get to know the real Bernie 😎Free health care and free television time!!! The hell with paying for anything!!!issuesThank god he finally got into politics..... <br />Bernie: Wait people can see my voting history on the www-machine?! Fuck...This podcast and the interviews with the presidential candidates makes them more human it allows them to elaborate as much as they wish, Like them or don’t you gotta appreciate what joe doesBernie &quot;Definitely not older than a Dinosaur&quot; SandersASMR BernieNooooooooo why Joe 🤣Bernie you keep saying getting Dem s in power will change things .it doesn&#39;t God damnit we know that from obamathis fucking guy has never had a job in his life, he has been in politics for like 40 years now, never worked outside politics, think about that, he is the fucking problem, anyone who thinks this guy can fix a fucking thing is a moron.Whaaat? Intanet bout to blow upBernie is one of the only politicians who actually cares about the America peopleJoe should be the moderator for a presidential debate.Oh my USA is such a fucked up country i only realised that now, god help you im so glad i live in Europe at least at the moment, please guys just reduce the power of the private companies, doesnt fucking matter if you vote for either Democrats or republicansBernie the cuckUBI for all!!!And everyone can benefit,you can pay your loads with that.Buzz buzz buzz, words. That&#39;s all he does, speak out his ass.Joe was only able to get a little over an hour out of this fraud.joe rogan is just like imran khan,the prime minister of pakistan,,,,,,love itFinally, Stan LeeGET TRUMP ON PLEASE JOEWas waiting for the “have u tried LSD?”If you don’t like this man just look at who we got in office. Lifetime politician of the people or a wealthy bigot?I’m not an American but the guy seriously needs to be president.Всего один час? Нам нужно больше Бёрни... Пусть приходит еще.Sanders can&#39;t even look him in  the eyes or anything how can you trust a man that won&#39;t even look you in the eyes when telling you complete and utter bullshit?This dude said &quot;Dnc wants to give everyone a fair shot....really, because didn&#39;t they do you dirty the last time w HilClin. This fk is weak.Yeah ok you’ll get free healthcare but will be shitcare. You really think free healthcare will work. Just go ask people in other countries. They HATE itThis nation only lets the RICH win.  If you don&#39;t relize that bernie is best canidate for the future of America, i do not know what its going to take to change your mind.I believe Bernie really cares about the people The fact that this man came on the Joe Rogans show speaks volumes on the type of character he is. Where&#39;s all the others?Props to Bernie for going on the Podcast. I still won&#39;t vote for him because he&#39;s full of shit, but props. Next up, Donald Trump, that would be hilarious.can someone tell me why the dislikes?Haven&#39;t started listening yet. But this is going to be worse than the first Twitter Interview if Joe doesn&#39;t really question him on his &quot;Free for all&quot; plans.An entire interview that really doesn’t actually address anything and really doesn’t answer any questions. I expect better RoganJoe please host a roundtable discussion with all the democratic candidates instead of these terrible bullshit “debates”@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m43s">5:43</a> <b>*&quot;If you go to Canada, and i live 50 miles away from the Canadian border, you have major heart surgery, you&#39;re in the hospital for a month, you know what the bill is when you get out?   &quot;Zero&quot; &quot;You got it&quot;.*</b> No Bernie, you still don&#39;t get it. This is so wrong and deceitful that it should be trampled into oblivion. Nothing &quot;Costs Zero&quot;. This is a stupid, disgusting, politically opportunist way of describing the tax system. You&#39;re either paying somebody less, cutting hours (like bernie did to his staff as a necessity of raising the wage, because he doesn&#39;t understand math or economics) or you&#39;re raising taxes to pay for the costs,(Which drives smaller competitors out of the market if they can&#39;t absorb the burden) and/or you&#39;re inflating the currency like many of these new Modern Monetary Theorists (Which Bernie had on his staff, look up Stephanie Kelton) want us to do.<br /><br /><br /> Bernie represents the worst kind of financial ignorance in my generation. The millenials that somehow or another have Amensia and are still slightly concussed from the 2008 financial crisis. This is the logic that brought us into recession, and it&#39;s going to lead back into recession if we follow it. What precipitated the 2008 financial crisis was an INCREASE in government spending in the housing market, leading to speculative financial behavior and eventual decline. Bernie would take that same energy, that same intervention, and put the speculative interest in the medical sector instead. This is a horrible idea, and the conflict of interest is enormous, We can&#39;t have a healthcare system that inherits the standard of &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot;. This is not the path forward. The American left has become so vicious in its ambition in the last few years that I don&#39;t even recognize it anymore.Click bait material,but it&#39;s the real McCoy.Go Joe!I can run <br />Climate change <br />Nuclear energy <br />Immigration crisis <br />Engage with Latin america and its governments instead of letting everyone in <br />And just keeping everyone out.Anyone can actually get healthcare in America go to the emergency room if you need to it’s just you’ll have to pay for it and there’s no way Universal Health Care would be as good as Health Care is now no f’n wayBernie has a better chance of His Eulogies before a Presidential speech, Ban Planes, Ban Cars, Ban it all.  Boeing 747 Planes Just Killed 400+ People. GTFOHo Lee Shit....<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=40m29s">40:29</a>, this sounds a lot like Israel.Joe called himself a libertarian some years ago. But he&#39;s not smart enough to stand on principle, he is easily persuaded. Thus, Joe Rogan isn&#39;t at all a challenging interviewer. He doesn&#39;t ask the right questions.Is Joe going to hold Bernie accountable on any issues? My guess is no.I hope that when the Dems screw Bernie out of the nomination again, he will run as an independent.Bernie effin Sanders is on JRE.. what a legend Joe is man, mad respect for reeling in the big fishI can’t believe you had this madman on your show.Doesnt climate change have lobbyists? I think so. So old and so naive. Dont care for Bernie but it was a nice conversation.Let&#39;s see who&#39;s given Bernie Sanders money.No dmt question but ge got an alien question in there.Although I completely disagree with Bernie Sanders, I respect the fact he took this interview.Daddy Bernie!We need Bill Burr and Hilary Clinton on here at the same time.I need a drink of water after listening to thisHealthcare is not a human right. If you&#39;re hurt or sick you can go to the emergency room and if you cant pay you dont have to. Medical debt isnt held against you. That seems pretty reasonable to me. And seriously, someone who&#39;s pro abortion cant lecture me on what is and isnt a human right.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=31m38s">31:38</a> - Not to mention the majority of kids who go to college are being pressured by their parents and others to go. So not only are these kids (myself being one of them at the time) getting themselves unknowingly into a situation that will potentially affect them for the rest of their lives (debt), but they are also being pressured to do it when they are WAY too young to understand all of the implications. It just makes no sense.You can’t expect a different product if the environment is steadily becoming worse 🤔<br />Better our environment simple as that <br />Minimum wage being raised means nothing if prices are going to raise along with it. Demons run this world and Greed sits close to the top.Hey Bernie..  come to britain and sit in A&amp;E for 4 hours waiting to be seen by a  doctor.Go Bernie!Wow, i&#39;d never of thought that Joe would have Larry David on the show.if i wasn&#39;t in VT i wouldn&#39;t have insurance and would have never got clean and been able to raise a family.Love it Joe!As a avid hunter all I need is a bolt action rifle and shot gun the thing is I don’t trust the fucking government<br />No one does and they shouldn’tsince england outlawed guns, the murder rate has skyrocketed people are just using knives now(edit and citizens that obey the law and would be able to protect themselves can not.). people are the issue not the tools they use to act our their lives.feel the burn... Oh that... that is the money in your wallet on fire.Listening to Bernie, I have a newer and positive  perspective about him. <br /><br />Joe, we as a Nation are in a terrible mess, jobs may be an underlying cause of some problems.<br /><br />Why not create something like the old CCC Camps, allocate funds  to address our massively crumbling infrastructure and train and pay workers the going union wages, conservatively estimated at $35-60/hour?  <br /><br />Lastly, drastically remove corporate tax avoidance loopholes.<br /><br />Pharmaceutical  companies spend around $1 billion to develop a new drug that may take 10-12 in the making<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />WhyJust in Chicago last year more people were killed by illegal guns then mass shooting with legal guns. 300 hundred people killed one city no one cares.Bernie 2020!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Where&#39;s my free shit?&quot;Trump gets more done in his first 6 months in office than Bernie has in 40 yearsI&#39;m quite certain Bernie would win against TrumpIsn’t Trump letting those folks who were put in jail on bogus marijuana convictions????<b>Youtube is manipulating his likes</b>   they are doing the opposite of what they did to Alex.Lobbyists aren’t inherently evil. There are many who lobby for good causes. It’s industry specific for who is funding said lobbyist that is evil or not evil.why so short?I started out liking you,  then I stopped.  Now I am liking you again Joe!! Great interview!Better dead than red. Honestly I pretty much agree on all the issues, I think the divergence in thought is I want the little guy to be able to eat the monopolies as opposed to giving daddy government the ability to squash everyoneI can validate the cost of prescription drugs being astronomical. My Tecfidera, 2 pills a day, prescribed for my multiple sclerosis, I&#39;m supposed to take every day for the rest of my life. But I can&#39;t - my bullshit &quot;copay&quot; is $3100 for a 30 day supply. I really wonder what people are paying in Canada for MS drugs? So far, in the last year since diagnosis, I have been unable to afford a single MS drug.Bernie for President! 2020! Feel the Bern repubilcucks!&quot;Marijuana ain&#39;t heroin&quot; please be presidentGun show loophole DOES NOT EXIST. Stop spreading lies Bernie.<br /><br />And the 2nd amendment doesnt care what you &quot;feel&quot; should or shouldn&#39;t be sold. Its absolute.Godwin&#39;s Law @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=1h04m43s">1:04:43</a><br /><br />The longer a discussion goes on the higher chance you mention that you&#39;re against HitlerAnybody else getting ASMR from Bernie&#39;s voice??I&#39;m so scared about finishing school. As an older student I was getting by on a high school education doing something I hated. Now I&#39;m pursuing an architecture degree which is exactly what I wanted to do and I&#39;m going to come out in debt.This is great. Even though I don’t agree with everything Sanders say, but it’s cool that Rogan is giving his podcast as an open podium for different opinions. Good on you, Joe. Now, when we’ll get the Sam Hyde episode, though?&quot;Rusher and Chiner&quot;🤣😂Yes. More Bernie Sanders!Nice been waiting for Larry David to be on as a guest.Rogan and Diaz 2020I&#39;m glad Sanders came on the podcast. I heavily disagree with many of his policies but you gotta give him credit for doing an hour long podcast to explain his policy more in depth. I DO agree with him that there are major issues with the drug companies lobbying in this country and there being issues with the prison system. Can&#39;t agree with his view on firearms. Its a continuation of the slippery slope to complete disarmament of the American people. <br /><br />Look at it like this. Many people are pushing the ban on &quot;assualt weapons&quot; now. IF it happens, they will realize that it has little to no impact on the problem of &quot;gun violence&quot;. Then, we will see other types of firearms banned, then, complete confiscation.<br /><br />We already had an &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban from 1994 to 2004. It was lifted because it was shown to have no impact on &quot;gun violence&quot;. Do we have such a short memory? Are we that ignorant of history?<br /><br />Another thing I have an issue with in regards to the 2nd is people always refer to semi-auto rifles as &quot;weapons of war&quot; and that soldiers/law enforcement should have them, not the people. Again, most people are not student&#39;s of history. When our country was founded, the greatest &quot;weapon of war&quot; was not a musket; it was a ship armed with cannons. Private citizen merchants owned these. In fact, by the time the War of 1812 rolled around, the US military had little more than a dozen of these, so they hired private citizens to help fight in the war. The people captured approximately 5x the amount of ships the military did. There is no arguement to be made that an AR-15 has more killing potential than a cannon armed ship. <br /><br />One more thing. The 2nd amendment isn&#39;t solely about self defense when faced with a criminal or madman. Not even the primary focus. It&#39;s about the people having the power to protect themselves from all enemies, foreign AND domestic.<br /><br />Wish Joe would have pressed more.&quot;JOE, IT&#39;S LEGAL BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS!&quot;The Marjiuana question you asked Bernie followed by his answer to it, gave me chills of happiness and a sense of relief! Thank you Joe for holding a sword to defend people like me and the values we believe in. I’ve been a follower of yours for several years. So I don’t mean to be a fanboy. I just hope that you have an opportunity to know that you’re appreciated. Can’t Tell me you don’t have a shot at someday being president. I’m sure you don’t want that kinda responsibility. But you do have that kind of power. Just saying that for whatever it’s worth. Thank you for what you do for regular human beings like me and the people who don’t have a voice without you.  God bless!Invite the POTUS next!Get Marianne Williamson on.How can you have vigorous research and development without a free market? Who eradicated small pox.. Bernie crashing your economy 2020The impossible was made possibleWe need Richard Spencer on the show next!!!TRUMP 20/20!!!!!!!!!!!!<b>*cough*</b><br /><br />Drink some fucking water Bernie goddamn!<br /><br /><b>*cough*</b>When I saw Joe got Bern on the show I was like dayuuum....Is Joe prepared for Trump to show up...?Facepalm and headshake. What a waisted opportunityThis is the guy, the rest of the world will stop laughing and have a bit of respect for the US! In my life I&#39;ve fractured my skull (2 weeks in hospital), broken ribs, a thumb (which required surgery), ligament and tendon damage in my ankle which required rehabilitation and it never cost me a single penny. I also obtained a Degree at Uni, which was (other than accommodation and books), totally free. Cheers from Scotland.Sanders makes so much sense it&#39;s absurd. <br /><br /><br />1. Tax Wall Street at less than one half of one percent over a ten year period<br />2. Cancels all student debt<br />3. <b>Sanders is a communist</b>He lost All chances of having a realistic campaign by banning weapons.

People should eat better and exercise. We already pay enough taxes.Lol, it really looked like Bernie didn’t want to answer that final question. Gets the noggin joggin.So long as the dems want open borders and free health care for undocumented immigrants, they’re doomed. Idiots.This guy is truly delusionalJoe &quot;i got a bit about that bit that i had a bit about&quot; RoganThis piece of SHIT....SOON AS $15 AN HOUR ACTUALLY BECAME A THING HE CUT HIS PEOPLE...FUCK THIS GUY...RUNS FOR PRESIDENT FOR ADVERTISEMENT AND THAT&#39;S ITThe US should have made Jaque Fresco the President in the 70s he would have could have and should have changed the world as we know itJoe you need to hear from the other side and finally have sam Hyde on your podcastBERNIE 2020Read a book increase your education and the job market in the area ain&#39;t right for you move<br />And if you&#39;re 30 years old working at Burger King that&#39;s your own f---ing fault<br />Probably should have been spreading your legsFAKE!  <a href="http://moveon.org/">Moveon.org</a> Bernie Sanders biggest financial doner entirely funded by George Soros.  FACT.  Bernie Sanders is a Soros puppet.  Prove me wrongGet this commie out of hereInteresting to see all the right wing Republicans disliking this videogetting my voteBernie on JRE, Andrew Yang going on H3 - it&#39;s a solid week for podcasts! Very glad to see these presidential candidates recognizing the importance of alternative / new media.So is it just me or does Bernie still not fucking know what an “assault weapon” is. I swear to god I tried to be open minded. But this man is totally against our constitution and wants to raise taxes in many small different ways. <br /><br />What is better than dis arming  and raising the taxes? Fuck politicians. They just want us people to fight each other but in the end it is us who has to write checks to them no matter what 😡Don&#39;t look down in the comments, don&#39;t look down in the comments, FUCK.I thoroughly enjoyed the conversation, thank you. Bernie 2020This old dude wants eye glasses and hearing aids free cause he definitely needs them if he was to be president. But I doubt he&#39;d live pass his full term.It would be amazing if joe got like 3 of the candidates in there and had civilized debates on stuffElect Bernie so we can see them aliens.1330 episodes it took him to push the mic where it’s suppose to beThis Bernie Sanders is a joke. He is the American problemYou can’t compare the United States to Canada... U.S all the wayAs a trump supporter I find myself agreeing with Bernie more than someone like HillaryI wish we could get a Bernie/Yang 2020 run. Really wouldn&#39;t mind Yang being president, and Bernie following through guiding him as VP. We need that young fresh face that isn&#39;t that of a career politician. Or a reality tv star for that matter.Have tulsi on, Bernie sucksBernie sure loves talking about other people&#39;s money.Well sense you had this joke on your podcast you got to get a monkey for the next oneSo many comments are  saying Bernie&#39;s hearts in the right place.. that may be true but he&#39;s a dumbass.‘Democratic debate hosted and produced by Joe Rogan” - knowledge is power please give more. Thank you for all you do.It’s cool but Burnie is sooo wrong! His views are all based on his rich guy views talking about communism! Communism has a rich class and a poor class and he knows he’ll be in the rich class like celebrities Communism is awesome for the rich  but Joe blow waiting in line for bread.... it sucks! If Bernie gives his net worth to charity... I’ll believe him!🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮I have a right to bare arms but I you shouldn&#39;t buy my gun4,000 dislikes already? Why?I usually lean more center than Bernie.....BUT after an associates degree and an ankle surgery I&#39;m over ten thousand dollars in debt. I plan on continuing my bachelor&#39;s, and then getting a doctorate in physical therapy...but the cost is making me uneasy. I spent most of 2017 with incredible pain in my jaw because I couldn&#39;t afford a root canal. I have severe depression and am plagued by suicidal ideations, yet I put off going to therapy because it was so costly. I&#39;m a hard working person who feels like he&#39;s drowning. I&#39;m willing to listen to this man.<br />Edit- Oh yeah! Also my godfather was a helicopter pilot who flew missions in the smokies for a TN task force looking for illegal marijuana farms. He died on duty when a micro burst slammed his helicopter to the ground. If weed was legal, he&#39;d still be alive.Joe, well done<b>Bernie as he steps in for the podcast</b> <br /><br />Bernie: Ahh these curtains are beautiful! What is this VELVET?Oh....this is going to be mentality draining. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m gonna make it through this one fellas. 😑Bernie bless your corrupt heart.It seems like Bernie is borrowing lines from Yangour future president <b>fingers crossed</b>Many valid points . he usually looks like a bluberish fool  I realy wonder which side of him is the real sideStealing Andrew Yang&#39;s point 30 seconds into the interview oof<br /><br /><br />SUPPORT UBI COME ON BERNIEWhen Joe asks the question, he really needs to answer it with a simple response then give context. Context first sounds like he’s trying to hard to convince someone when he should be clear at the beginning.I don’t agree with almost all of Bernie’s policies, but out of all the democrats he is the only sane onelol thank christ he will never be presidentWhen Bernie talks politics he usually refers to another country that created his wet dream. So its a little disturbing to hear him say he&#39;s a 2nd admendment guy but then refers to Austrailia no wait lol &quot;where they moved pretty quickly with legislation&quot;. Sorry but this guys a snakeBernie go on Shapiro&#39;s Sunday Special!Ben Shapiro 2024Would have liked to have seen Joe push back on some of these ideas but I guess that&#39;s too much to ask from Joe🥎Awesome.My head explodedSo I assume Bernie walked through the crowd of homeless people into the building with armed security to talk about open borders and banning guns.<br />What&#39;s their net worth by the way? <br />Will there be any Republicans on soon?<br /> So unbiased.....I love Joe but Socal taints his views.Wish this was longer<b>FREE STUFF AND TAKE THE GUNS</b> is what i got from this interview.   Gets a little respect for coming on the podcast but he made it short on purpose, anyone can bullshit and jump around points easy for an hour, especially politicians, all they do for a living is lie.SoftballI really think Bernie loves the American people and wants the best for the country. I don’t agree with his methods. Not even 5% of his methods. But I’m enjoying this podcast so far. Listening to every side of the argument with an open mind is a forgotten aspect of modern day American society.I took a shit and didn&#39;t flush..and my girl thought I threw up.Please have Trump onAnother soft ball interview from Joe... Jesus dude you have a guy demanding to raise minimum wage, yet has his campaign workers leaving because he&#39;s not paying them $15 an hour and his rationale is &quot;market dictates pay.&quot;  <br />Didn&#39;t ask a man who&#39;s never held a legitimate job how he owns so many large homes as a public servant...I was excited to see Sanders&#39; name in the title...but of course, let down by Joe going soft, again.  Guess Bernie has to demand the banning of pot in order to get Joe to get serious.<br />Or...Joe saying being 18 is too young to make a decision that has life long consequences regarding choosing a college education.  BUT...bernie thinks a 3 year old can choose to mutilate their genitals... Pathetic Joe...downright sad dude.What happened to personal responsibility?  Take out a loan for a 100k liberal arts degree. Pay your dues to the US. Join the military. Use the GI bill. Work 2 jobs. Life’s about choices.🙌 Finally, so glad you had him on!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m13s">27:13</a> <br /><br />BS: GUESS WHAT??!?  50 years ago...<br />Do you know how much the University of California cost in terms of tuition? <br /><br />JR: How much? <br /><br />BS: Virtually free.<br /><br />JR: What’s it now? <br /><br />BS: I don’t know. <br />But it’s pretty high... <br /><br />😩😂🤣🤣&quot;The truth is... Well i don&#39;t have the numbers in front of me.&quot;.  What a Piece of shitLMAO Joe shat on weed from VermontJoe is such a dumbass when he talks about politicsBernie by day Sanders by night all dayThe civilian ARs and AKs are not &quot;Assualt Weapons&quot; you piece of shit! We don&#39;t have to make any concessions, Australia had their failed buy back/ban home invasions went up 19%. Joe get your facts straight, if your gonna have these idiots on here actually challenge them like you would if they weren&#39;t Democrats.Bernie is just jealous he isn&#39;t a billionaire.Sorry. Not impressed with this interview. Feels like a collection of all his tropes.Ben Shapiro would destroy himAwesome that joe has Democrats on his show..<br />However,,,8 yrs of Clinton,,,8 yrs of Obama  and NON of wat Sanders is talking about EVER came to fruition...hes repeating the exact same lines of every Democrat to get voted  then they do NOTHING..<br />Sanders is a multimillionaire and is part of the problem...<br />Hes whoring himself to get voted in...dont fall for it..How the fuck do people acquire that much debt going to school? Like someone please explain it to me&quot;if they can cover seniors why can&#39;t we expand that program and cover everybody else I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a difficult operation.&quot;  Not so difficult???  Paying for over 300 million people&#39;s healthcare?  It is a big deal you nutcase!If only Bernie was less of a socialist (leaning towards communism)<br />Cause I&#39;d voteThese political guests need 3 hours Joe.Joe is litterally the middle thank you!BolshevikHe hasn’t mentioned once anywhere how he will make education cheaper, he just talks about how it will be free. Free means the government buys it with your money and gives it to you. Universities have raised prices since scholarships and loans started exploding. Why not force the universities to lower the cost of tuition?Bernie &quot; In order for America to be better and Happy Government needs more power&quot; SandersJoe Rogan 2024Why not encourage these kids to work harder in highschool get all those benefits so they have to pay less for college?  Or encourage them to go into a trade? Or better yet encourage them to go into the military where basically everything is paid for?Not once does this stupid bitch say a word about where all this money is going to come from to fund his pioe dreams.   Socialist pig shit.LIKE IF YOU’RE CONFIDENT IN BERNIE SANDERS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸‼️‼️‼️Doe&#39;s Joe ask him about Identity politics?These dumb fucks calling Joe a &quot;sellout&quot; and a &quot;socialist&quot; just because he had Bernie on the podcast are so fucking stupid lol. Jesus Christholy shitThis is either going to be extremely interesting or extremely boring... no in between.A big thing that nobody talks about is that Bernie is against NSA spying and the PATRIOT Act. So much for BIG GUBBERMENT COMMIE BERNIE&quot; Being on Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast is a human right. &quot;  Bernie on next free thing he is giving that belongs to someone else.  The government is doing a terrible job at everything it does, lets throw more money at it, and steal more from the people.WhoaIt’s almost like a morally corrupt system breeds morally corrupt people 🤔Lmao Bernie didn&#39;t even answer the minimum wage questionThanx for having Bernie on here joe!Bernie just wants to be President and will say anything to get votes! Does anyone actually take him serious? He is a multi millionaire from being a politician and has never had a real job! He just wants to get where the Clintons and Obamas are after being crooked democrats! When he is worth 100&#39;s of millions dollars he will be happy!Pretty good podcast.<br />Joe pushed back a fair bit, and actually got Bernie to articulate on some of his ideas.<br />2016 Bernie was a cool candidate, had left leaning ideas(forgiving student debt,medicare for all) while still having positions most people could relate with(Curbing illegal immigration), but after $Hillary stole the nomination and he bowed down to the progressive far left agenda he is alienating the center, He lost nuance on a lot of his talking points,all to gain a voting base that will probably already vote for him. <br /><br /><br />His calls to increase the minimum wage to 15$ is extremely hypocritical, his campaign staffers were demanding a raise to 15$ and he cut their hours.<br /><br /><br />The tax on wallstreet trading could go either way, if its too large it will drive away investors.<br /><br /><br />Once he got to the gun control issue,  thankfully Joe pushed back a bit using the self defense argument, and Bernie recognizes the fact that most gun owner are not violent, but banning &quot;assault weapons&quot; is not the answer, especially since a lot of these mass shooters get these guns illegally/or use a family members weapon, and would probably switch to other tactics if the their weapon of choice is banned.<br />What happened to his &quot;Gun control is a different issue if you live in a rural/urban environment&quot;  argument.most of u man disliked without watchingBernie “in Canada” SandersJoe bitched out. He could have asked some hard hitting questions but he didnt. I hope he gets shit. <br />so boring, so bernie. Seriously, lets not forget he is the same dude saying trump praises nazis which is a total lie. Same dude saying lines for food in cuba is a good thing. fuck bernie, and fuck his 15 dollar inflation causing minimal wage.in canada you need health care insurance if not you payIn other countries they threatened and kill your family if you fight out against the current powerCOMMIE SCUM.

Seemed I me like a month ago he was hated. Is everyone just sayin they like him just because he was in the podcast. No buenoWe need to move the bottom 90% into the top .01%...its simple mathjoe didn&#39;t disappoint by not asking about aliens LULDonald trump next right ?!?!Bernie sounds like a guy from the 50s or somethingDisgusting human leech on societyI wish you pushed him more on the $15 minimum wage. 10/10 concept. But it would absolutely destroy small business. US economy is made up of 99% of small business. 88% of those small businesses have less than 20 employees. 40% of small businesses earn $100k or less in revenue. Amazon and Disney as he mentioned can absorb the increase in overhead. Those small businesses cannot. Which will result in small businesses cutting hours, cutting jobs, or risk going out of business due to the increase in payroll and payroll taxes.YangGang2020<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m20s">35:20</a> &quot;Buy a dozen guns and sell them illegally &quot; so what you&#39;re saying is that a law wouldnt stop them?This is the episode we’ve been waiting for.

FEEL THE BERN YOUR RIGHT WING NUTSThank you Joe for having my main man Bernie on! He’s the one that has the grassroots movement behind him to win this election.I like how hoe rogans podcast is basically the biggest now...grade A guests....good show...Who the hell thinks 15 dollars an hour is a living wage?it&#39;s exciting to have you here, MAN! hahahah <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m10s">0:10</a>Such a cartoonized picture of the healthcare industry. They make &quot;Me too drugs&quot; and &quot;small incremental changes&quot; because the FDA makes it cost prohibitive to take chances on a experimental drugs. The amount of work, red tape, and costs/fees that goes into approving new drugs is ludicrous. <br /><br />Also, why is he blaming pharma and not the insurance companies who obfuscate the costs to the end user and basically control the market for drugs / healthcare?Oh shit.....I really cant do this one Joe sorry. Jk I&#39;m a trump gal but I believe in respectfully hearing  peoples beliefs....Bernie is alright.All presidential candidates need to have a conversation with uncle joe roganWhy does he avoid eye contact with Joe? He dodged questions left and right...He gave NO solutions that would work. His false humility is scary. 5+5=10 , not whatever you feel it should be....i should also add im 29 and Bernie&#39;s target audience. I was formerly a liberal of 15 years - until two years after voting for Obama a 2nd time and realizing he was lying to us the whole time. Watch the immature, whiny comments stack up under this comment!!!Bernie is a socialist yet he owns 3 homes.  Rules for thee but not for me.A minimum wage is totally stupid. Why?<br /> Because it makes employment who don&#39;t generate more money then the minimum wage illegal. <br />Lets say the minimum wage is 15dollars. Imagine if the average speed someone picking blueberries is 1 liter / hour. Well now the price of blueberries has to be 15 dollars per liter. But here comes the problem someone is prob willing to pick those berries for less then 13 dollars. But that has now turned illegal in a minimum wage society. Now picking berries in a neighbouring country + shipping is going to out compete the price a company who have to spend 15Dollars/hour per berriepicker. You might then say. Good we should not be picking berries in US anyway, fine but if someone wants to you just made it illegal unless they can pick enough to support the minimum wage. If they can&#39;t meet the qoute you won&#39;t be able to pay tax on it because then it will show you making below the minimum and thus breaking the law. So now this income has to be done without paying tax. Now people doing this are losing their social benefits because they don&#39;t pay tax. Because if they do they are breaking the law.Joe &quot;confirmed shill&quot; RoganHell yes!!I’m pretty right wing but I think Bernie is a good man and America would be just fine with him as president 🇺🇸putin sucks my FAT cock.This should be a laugh cheap ass BernieHow many times can one man not explain how he will implement healthcare? Did he ever explain the process to get universal healthcare implemented?this is fucking huge for joeDude doesn&#39;t even pay his staff members 15 an hr.Sanders is nuttier than squirrel shit.What? Did anyone just notice the likes just jump forward? Youtube is manipulating the likes.The hurdle is spending less on the MIC and more on the people. Cept it&#39;s not a hurdle. It&#39;s a wall. A big, hidious wall.I don’t agree with the socialist agenda but I like Bernie because he’s an honest guy that can’t be bought.JESUS CHRISTmore natural history and drugs and less politics please ok thanksBERNIE 2020I&#39;d much rather have Jordan Peterson as presidentWho says Canadss Health Care is as good or better.

But legalizing marijuana and canceling student debt do not go together as a political agenda..Legalizing weed is a logical and rational possibility, while canceling student debt and open borders is NOT either logical nor rational. Bernie is a dump candidate, and along with allll the other democrats, helping Trump in 2020.Are u fucking kidding me joe, Bernie Sanders,  are u a socialist Joe? Oh of course u are ur fucking rich...We need Wes Watson on this IG watson_fit. Will change your life!College is so expensive because politicians like him made government backed loans that are impossible to default on.  Those loans made is so colleges could charge whatever they want and also make majors that people can never get a good paying job in those fields.Not watched it all yet, but please tell me you asked him why he can&#39;t say HUMAN. Is it his way of covering his own ass &quot;I never said healthcare for all, it&#39;s a human right. I said it&#39;s a YUMAN right.&quot;BERNIE&#39;S ON JOE ROGAN! YESSSSS!!!!! WISH HE COULD HAVE DONE THE FULL 3 HOURS.Healthcare is retarded just stop eating Fucking slave foodThere’s lying Bernie at it again. Did he pay joe to not ask tough questions? Lolfuck this guy and his communist socialist bullshit, you should fuck off to another country bernieHappy to see many of the candidates going on the JRE!

No it&#39;s not that gonna cut all gains and make stuff cost more all of this sounds like HYPER INFLATION are you joking HFT is not the problemNot a deep question, Bern. Who the hell do you think controls the heroin trade? Think troops guarding record yoeld after record yield. Think Fetulah Gulen/FETO protected by the last 4 POTUS. Not only bringing in shipments of heroin to hubs like Chocago, but also taking public school money, since Gulen is at the head of the largest charter school network in the USA. The simple answer is that the black market is funding Pentagon/CIA/NATO Operation Gladio Plan B. WE CONTROL THE HEROUN TRADE AND YOU KNOW IT, BERN.<br /><br />💥  Sworn Deposition <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EVIDENCE">#EVIDENCE</a> <br /><a href="https://www.newsbud.com/2017/02/17/newsbud-special-report-state-secrets-sibel-edmonds-uncovers-the-untouchables/">https://www.newsbud.com/2017/02/17/newsbud-special-report-state-secrets-sibel-edmonds-uncovers-the-untouchables/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AllTalkNoCourage">#AllTalkNoCourage</a> as you demonstrated after the 2016 primary theft. WHY would anyone trust you?If he actually starts challenging the commercial interests that be, he&#39;ll be JFK:ed faster than Cheney could say &#39;Saddam has weapons of mass destruction&#39;This dude has no idea what an assault weapon is. You have to have a Class 3 license to own a fully automatic weapon. which is what the military uses. And his thing about Selling guns to criminals??? It&#39;s illegal to sell cocaine and police arrest people everyday for it.YES“JOE IT IS LEGAL BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE LAWS!!” 😂🤣That is not why Tuition cost has gone up so high he&#39;s lying out his ass or is just ignorant to the facts.   If you look back it was after the government got involved in colleges and we see a giant spike in tuition costs after the laws were passed that basically put the federal government in full control of the student loans and basically garaunteed anyone the amount of money they needed for the school that accepted them and that no collateral was needed and no one else was on the hook accept the person who signed the loan.  If the college&#39;s would have had to co-sign those loans this shit would have never happened.  If you try to get a loan for anything else you have to prove that u can afford it. Weather that&#39;s through collateral such as your house or business.  A steady income or having a co-signer that can take over the loan should you not be able to pay for it.  You need none of this for a college loan.  And the government sets the interest rates.  If the government was to stay out of higher education you would see a huge drop in tuition costs because the free market would determine the cost and nobody in there right mind is going to say hey kid that has no way of paying me back here I&#39;ll give u 50k cause u want to go to college, and get a degree in lesbian dance theory, cause that will never get u a job. It will go back to a normal price that everyday people can afford.  More corporations will  front the money for training and a garuntee that u will work for them for 2 years or whatever. There are certain things that government should never be involved in because it&#39;s to easy for politians to corrupt because of the lobbying and what not. You stop guaranteeing the loans and the college&#39;s will stop accepting this will cause enrollment to drop which in turn will cause costs to drop to raise enrollment<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=37m36s">37:36</a> The 2A amendment is neither about hunting nor about self defense it is ability of the people to overthrow a tyrannical government either foreign or domestic.We pay twice as much for healty care but we also have the  #1 health care in the world.

That&#39;s not reality.Disgusting 🤢I supported Bernie back in 2015 but that was his only chance at winning, unfortunately. He should have stood up for himself instead of rolling over for Hillary and now he looks weak, especially after the names he calls the president. Smh, SAD!Get wendell potter on to talk about health care propaganda!Please have Trump as wellInstant dislike for the commieJoe rogan  for president!!!!!Dude....do yang again joeHuh I actually do not know much about Bernie, I am excited to watch this. I usually only see him during debates and stuff, seeing him just talk is different.Joe really needs to take the flag down, read about every other countries&#39; politics and gun control and understand that his baby country with the 2nd amendment is ridiculously backwardsI wanted trump or Bernie back in the day. Then crooked Hillary was the den choice so the option was clear!!!!!!Am I dreaming?? Holy shit I&#39;m pumped let&#39;s go!Joe for president.Bernie rhymes with spernySanders is a goddamn American hero. The most transformative candidate of my lifetime. I have no idea if he can pull this off or not -- the obstacles are mind-boggling -- but the fact is that he has started a movement and many will continue where he leaves off.Canada&#39;s health care system is highly overrated. Our advantage in drug pricing is the only one.Bernie is the only person on the Democratic side that can beat Trump, in my opinion in a land fucking slide. Americans don’t realise this man honestly cares about the American people.Everyone says they&#39;re going to fill their cabinet with good people then just fill it up with Goldman Sachs employees.I am a Conservative Trump supporter and I’m 30 min into the Video and going to watch the whole Video for all you sht Talkers.can Joe just host a democratic debate on his show?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=47m24s">47:24</a> Rogan breaks out the Tommy Chong BatI am not a fan of Bernie Sanders but I really appreciate that you brought him to the podcast, I wish you had challenged him more on some of his policies maybe you should have a debate between him and another presidential candidate? Just an idea would love to see more democratic candidates on your podcast as well as Republican candidates and independent candidates, you do a much better job of flushing out their ideas and agendas for the country than at the debates on the major television networksSo three minutes in, and Bernie is already talking about passing legislation to control the media. Welcome to how the government does things.If you took your clothes off you’d have media frenzy?   No sir!   You’d have a bunch of people vomiting on their smart phones.When you talk about income inequality and you&#39;re rich you are a hypocrite. When you talk about income inequality and you&#39;re poor, you&#39;re bitter. Its almost like they just don&#39;t want anyone talking about income inequality.Motherfucker did it, right when you think he wasn&#39;t gonna ask about aliensSeems like a sensible manBernie fucking Sanders?I don&#39;t like the fact that Bernie hardly makes eye contact with Joe, just seems he trying to remember his scriptSound bites are not democratic.Damn Joe. You&#39;re the best.Joe for presidentI love that the right wing deplorables are sitting there clicking the unlike button like madmen but still only make up 20% of the overall crowd. Lmao. Fucking losers.Bernie literally knows nothing about guns, I don&#39;t know shit but this guy knows way less than I do. If I hear another politician say &quot;assault weapons&quot; I swear.Get out and vote people! We need change, the orange clowned face fool lied to everyone and he needs to go!Holy shit he did it! Thanks young Jamie. And Bernie.!Regardless of your political opinion, if you disagree with Sanders about how the rich move and operate in the country then you’re dead wrong. Get money out of politics, and Sanders has been saying it since day 1.I&#39;m thankful now I can see Bernie in a long-form context outside the leftist bubblesBernie Sanders goes sneaker shopping with complexRemember when Hillary put her throbbing sausage up your wrinkly oreo hole Bernie?

I want to bang my head on concrete.Bernie speaking the truth as usual.Andrew Yang 2020Immediately have the biggest smileThe reality is if you don&#39;t have millions of dollars to push your agenda you don&#39;t matter especially at the presidential level, people should be focusing on local elections that have a direct impact on the quality of your life and the people around you, how can the average person go up against a system that is controlled by the billionaire class?It&#39;s funny because people will still say &quot;Joe Rogan gives a platform for the alt-right&quot; even after thisI fucking love you Bernie and JoeBernie Sanders is just another Marxist race baiting libBoringso much for freedom if hes electedDamn he had me until he said he’s taking guns.

Forthwith please, and thank you, *A.His answers are sooo long and spotty i was just trying to stay awake long enough to see his point.  More of a philosopher than a politician. Too honest and logical.Damnnn , Bernie using the internet to his advantage bigtime !  The fact that millions of people watch this show and will probably watch the whole thing puts Joe on a new level of power.  this channel could revolutionize this country by this Interview alone 💪🏼💪🏼what does bernie know about kennedy...Bernie &quot;I Just talk to a...&quot; SandersYou lost me at ban AR15s. Fuck you Bern!I really hope this sparks a trend where we see a bunch of the candidates jump in the podcast. There&#39;s nothing better than sparking debate, and actually talking through, in detail your ideas for presidency. <br /><br />I don&#39;t want to listen to Bernie though, I know how his and my ideas don&#39;t align already.<br /><br />Just imagine though, having Trump on JRE. Shit would be both hilarious and huge. Having the current president in for a podcast. Or maybe after his second term. 😎Did I miss Kanye? Or did he just not come on?You know this one&#39;s gonna pass 10 mil...Joe Rogan&#39;s triggered right-wing fanbase be like, &#39;old man bad!&#39; 😂America will BURN IN HELL... under bernies administration LOLSenator Sanders truly cares about the American People.college will be free stupid so why do you need to raise minimum wage for students...retardRogan, sadly it looks like most of your viewers are Trump supporters. SHIIIIT, time to get old Trumpo on your podcast to prove them wrongHealthcare, pharmaceuticals, college, 401k, housing, its all designed to make us slaves through debt.Great episodeHave i missed the questions about the border??Hats off to you joe for inviting Bernie on the show . ( ever see the movie “ Rudy”  Lol 😂) can you seriously imagine this jack ass as our President ?Joe “I had Bernie Fucking Sanders On” Rogan<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=50m48s">50:48</a> when joe asks a question that msm would never ask and stumps Bernie and makes him laugh with no real answer.From my cold dead hands.This is America not the UK! Fuck socialism!I challenge anyone that disagrees with his policies how would you address these issues on health care, income wealth inequality, mass shootings, and climate change?I dont trust ppl like Bernie with good reason. He believes the government can fix things it cant fix. <br /><br />Joe is just gonna soft ball him. With that said if he wins I HOPE IM WRONGDemocrats dont even know how to fix the debates let alone the country!Bernie 2020!Bernie: young people are going to college and then not getting jobs<br /><br />Also Bernie: we should all pay for more people to go to collegeHere to see if Bernie smokes weedJust finished the full video and honestly it was kinda annoying how joe rarely questioned/debated Bernie about controversial topics and also never bothered to ask him to prove/verify any “facts” he was stating like he usually would to other guest. Overall though it was a good episode though it’s mainly just Bernie talking majority of time with joe popping in every now and then to ask a question or give his opinion. So I’m still definitely not a supporter of Bernie but I have no prejudice against him and wish him good luck in 2020 cause it’s gonna be a hell of a race.Cost of healthcare has DOUBLED in 20 years. Our jobs pay the majority of the cost. Wages are flat. You&#39;d have to be a fool to not realize those two things are related.... and healthcare is a much bigger factor in wages than &quot;taxes and regulations&quot;.I would actually listen to this guys views on income inequality if he didnt own 3 houses and have millions of dollars.Joe it is legal because they make the laws!!! Gotta love Bernie!!!Haha, Bernie telling Joe to get Mitch on the show. Now this was a great podcast, but I would <b>kill</b> to watch Joe dismantle Mitch and make him retreat into his shell.Policy wise, not a fan. Much respect for him coming on the podcast and having a lengthy discussion. All politicians need to follow this example.Bernie says the rich have so much power over the system because they own so much wealth. But the government owns far more wealth and has mondo control over your life already. Nice try with the rhetoric. I’m sure you’re good to your grandkids and all, Bernie, but you want a form of government that I don’t.All Bernie wants is health care for all, and all I and Ron Paul wanted, was to audit the fed. Thanks for voting against that bill multiple times Bernie. <b>eyeroll</b>Oh great let&#39;s see if Joe goes full libtard.Joe goes to easyHe lost me at the &quot;world will end in 12 years due to climate change.&quot;. I also strongly disagree with the minimum wage idea.  It demonstrates his economic illiteracy.Ladies and Gentlemen, your organizer and chief, President Sanders 🙌🏿🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸😭👴🏻Get Trump on here when the presidential campaign starts :)WONDER IF HE&#39;S GOING TO SMOKE WEED?<br />WONDER HOW MUCH JOE IS GETTING PAID FOR THISYang Gang!If the &quot;Over the last 30 years the top 1% has seen a $21 Trillion increase in their wealth, while the bottom 50% has seen a $900 billion decline in their wealth.&quot; is true, then the top 1% is 20 times better in making money than the 50% bottom is in losing money.I&#39;m a centrist. <br />Bernie is right. <br />The USA is run by private companies that don&#39;t care about the poor patients who need medication. <br />They only care about PROFIT.Mitigate despair? Material will never satisfy.  We are the most non religious now.12 minutes in and this is a tough listen so far, Joe hasn&#39;t challenged him at all and I would be shocked if his BS meter hasn&#39;t gone off at least once.Did he ever give a straight answer that made sense?When Bernie talked about student early on (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=17m25s">17:25</a>) , it hit a cord about my own situation. As someone who is going to college for nursing I have two base options: One to go through the system like everyone else and hope I get scholarships , grants, pell grants, etc to pay for it, or to go through the military and have them pay for it.Get Trump onJoe get him some fucking water manSo nobody is going to call him out on his state having a 10 an hr minimum wage?God bless you bernie! You angel from aboveeeee!!!! God bless protect and keep you! God bless your work!ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE NOT A REAL THING... handguns killed 7,500 people in 2017 while RIFLES killed 400 peoplei believe americans will be equally incompetent no matter how free market or how socialized or regulated our healthcare and health insurance systems are.Awesome Interview!!!Next person on the podcast: Donald TrumpReally happy to see thisIf bernie was younger, this interview would probably last 5 hours. what the fuckShould have had Ben Shaprio or Steven Crowder on with him, would have been more balanced and more entertaining.New drinking game take a shot every time bernie says money.Hes talking about the things that should be addressed that are not reason being he is not president was tough in 16 against trump and hillary i hope the ppl get behind bernie he has his mind on things that matter <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>Bernie is a disgusting creature, he mentions Canada constantly but never mentions the citizens of Canada sued the government to be allowed private options and won in 2005, but in some regions it&#39;s still not fully legal like BC. Worse the Canadian gov puts huge stipulations on private options like doctors having to work X hours in public sectors each year before even being allowed to consider private offerings. It&#39;s not the magical working system he makes it out to be.<br /><br />And no shit 19 million people signed up for medicare/medicaid, 25% of our national budget goes to those two and the taxes come out of my pay whether I want to be involved in it or not. I don&#39;t have that choice.I am glad I listened , he doesn’t have a full knowledge of the gun situation , but I’m glad I heard a plan for his healthcare ideas and taxation on the rich I was a Bernie supporter in 2016 and now in 2019 I support trump because of how our economy has bounced back and I believe in America first , but I love hearing these ideas still flow in my head and my ideology and realize there’s no only left or right but there can be a centerHe had me on the health care then he started talking about the top 1% and it started sounding like commie horseshitIf you disagree with bernies agenda at the very least. You&#39;re part of the problemLOL! First, Bernie indicates that there are people having their Social Security garnished to pay for College education, as if it is common problem.  Keep in mind that anyone on S.S. would have likely gone to school nearly ~50 years prior, unless it was school later in life.   Then, predictably, he goes on to point out that the cost of College in California was nearly free 50 years ago.  Which is it Bernie? <br /><br />Instead, of unrealistically trying to give College away for free to everyone, why not discuss the real problem, which is why the cost of College education has been skyrocketing out of control for decades, while the quality has tanked?  Fix that and maybe people can afford to pay their own way,  instead of free handouts.How about him cutting hours of his staff after being forced into a position of having to pay his staffers 15 a hour? LolBernie Sanders initials summarise his ideas.Do good and do no harm. Reconsider your point of view and think about what happens with your health care system and your rights and ALSO the privileges as a citizen and your influence in the most influential society on this planet as of now. I strongly believe that this guy can save your country and improve the world we ALL live in. I believed that before this video because of the stuff I researched and looked up about him... and my opinion is even stronger after this. Do not, and I repeat; PLEASE DO NOT doom the development of the society of the world (even if it just starts with yours) because of your personal discomfort.I&#39;ve been critical of Joe lately but he did an excellent job of asking the right questions today.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fucktwitter">#fucktwitter</a>i like his reasonings and philosophy behind policies, but when it comes to the actual policies and implementation, i cant side with itSuper impressive to see Bernie be able to sit down and calmly explain his proposals without the reality Tv time constraints that the debates demand. Damn good podcast; the guys got great ideasF U R a LAZY USELESS STUPID DUMB UNGRATEFUL UNAMERICAN IMBECILE... n U want everything... for FREE<br /><br />then vote DEMONcRAT LOLThis is what I think of comunist Bernie and his brain dead supporters 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 no 90% tax for meBernie 2020 babe!You just won him the presidency.

Trump is the best talker. The best folks.I enjoy a great quality of life that I&#39;ve worked very hard to achieve, as have many other people. If you can put some of these policies in effect with out changing any aspect of that then I&#39;m all for it. I just highly doubt that is the case.Our political state is embarrassing. Bernie’s got nothing. <br />Tulsi has a little something tickling my taint though.......!?Bernie sanders... Oh shit..why dont democrats want insurance companies or doctors to profit, it provides incentive to compete with they&#39;re competition. Canada has terrible quality of health care. My kids will not grow up in a communist country mr sanders no way&#39;Diseases of Despair&#39; ... thankyou Bernie for talking about this&quot; do you know how much college in California was 50 years ago???, virtually free!!&quot; Bernie, &quot; do you know how much college in California costs now &quot;??. joe &quot; how much&quot; Bernie &quot; don&#39;t know, lots ! &quot; ahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahaah this crook has all the ideas but no answers that are logical!!!!!!!! when he cannot answer a simple question relating to his argument this dirty communist has no idea . He hasn&#39;t thrown any reliable factual economic numbers that explain how he plans to fund these wild cooky ideas that make no sense from a economic stand pointRaises wages for his campaign staffers... Cuts hours... Dude will put this country further into debt than it already is. Appreciate the viewpoints but he doesn&#39;t know his ass from his elbow when it comes to economy and how to run an entire country&#39;s, at that.1331 better be Larry David!This old man I wouldn&#39;t trust driving.......Joe should have invited Bernie to hit a blunt, get him on Elon&#39;s level.rich people telling people that the other rich people are the problem and not themGo Bernie.

So happy to see Bernie on! Hes got my vote!All wr have to do is give the man a chance for four years thats it. I believe its the best choice for the American people and economy. 4 years give him a shot if not just vote aomeone else its simple lets give the man a chance to prove it can work for all of us and not some of usBernie&#39;s heart is on the right place , but his mind isn&#39;t . # mathI&#39;m just here for the comments<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m15s">27:15</a><br />Bernie: guess how much it costed? <br />Joe: how much? <br />Bernie: I don’t know, pretty low <br />Joe: how much does it cost now? <br />Bernie: I don’t know, pretty highIf you close your eyes... He sounds like Joey Diaz.Great. I need to wake up and go to work in about 4 hours, and now i have to watch this. <br />This dude is hilariously crazy, and wrong about a lot, but i still love him! :-)Phony Bernie. Pharma this, pharma that., But vaccines, those are super cool, no issues there.Mofuckas kbow public school is all bad. Its been ruled in Ohio for years by surpreme court public school funding in ohio is illegal. But its still going on in sure it similar everywhereWHEN U GONNA HAVE TRUMP ON???nice one Joe... never fail to impress me with who you can get on the pod...Bernie: I don&#39;t trust the corruption in our government and they work against the people.<br />Also Bernie: when bad people do bad things, the honest people should make concessions to make it harder for anyone, except government, to have said weapons. <br />Why not try the crazy idea of not demonizing guns and allowing people to defend themselves against these psychos?You can&#39;t fix the US with political mechanics. Tax this, ban that. The mechanics are just expressions of the underlying collective psyche of the population.tax on wall street to wipe out student debt lol fuck off loser the majority of people don&#39;t support debt removal...wage pressure just causes inflation so nothing changes dumassPretty pretty pretty pretty pretty goodthe 10 drug companies made 69 billion dollars,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />niceJoe Rogan what a f*<b>***</b> criminal out there on the stock market!Crowder is gunna have fun with this.... can&#39;t wait...lol.Joe why aren’t you asking him follow up question? For example we need to make changes for climate change yet we’re decreasing pollution when other countries like China and India are raising their pollution in the air and ocean?Automation!!??He talks about whats wrong but, when joe asks him how do we fix it, he doesnt have an answer.Bernie Sanders buys the fake news by AOC on climate. smhAh that’s what Biden meant: if you want the right president, go to Joe #1330.bernie&#39;s a bit too wokeIt’s nice hearing a politician be able to articulate a vision. You don’t get that with Trump.SANDERS/GABBARD 2020 🇺🇸Sanders/Ventura 2020nobody would want to be a doctor if you do that lol it wouldnt be worth it bernie you dumb dumb you would be a dictator to force doctors to work for low wagesLiterally 30 years, and Bernie is saying the same SHIT.<br /><br /><br />Ask him WHERE the money comes from to do what he wants. WHERE? His magic fucking BEANS?Doctor shortages coming right up commies. 6 month wait times and single payer system that will ramp up national debt even faster.Excellent podcast with Bernie. I agree with every stance Bernie takes. He has a vision to make a great nation. Please people dont ruin the one chance to make America truly great again. Give Bernie Sanders that chance. He will work overtime for all Americans. I can see it and feel it with Bernie Sanders.<br />Ps.  <br />7$ an hour is NOT a livable wage, with the cost of living rising yearly, it just cant be done! And people wonder why millennials still live at home depressed.Lost me on all the incorrect info about firearms.But I like AK-47s Bernie boy can’t get rid of thoseThis is the most I&#39;ve ever heard Bernie speak. He sounds like when Howard Stern imitates his parents.THIS IS LENGTHY PLEASE READ FIRST His outlook on firearms is interesting BUT he forgot to say that the reduction for the assault weapons ban COMPARED TO THE PAST NOT NOW. Was only 5% reduction in gun violence. It was deemed ineffective BUT the difference between past and present is the news and social media approach that appeals to the lunatics.      I’m ALL for a background check enhancement BUT I promise you that’s simply banning mags WILL NOT change the situation. A crazy person can do JUST AS MUCH damage with a handgun or shotgun. With little training you can reload very fast. So If a Ban is the answer you will HAVE TO BAN EVERYTHING, which will not happen due to the bill of rights which politicians are SWORN TO PROTECT.    So let’s limit the sociopaths and psychopaths accessibility.      If there ISNT going to be forcible confiscation (I’m quoting Bernie on this) then WHAT IS THE POINT???    “Assualt weapons” is an INACCURATE FEAR TERM the AR-15 is a 1 shot per trigger-pull gun. It IS NOT A MACHINE GUN, those are HIGHLY REGULATED already. Only millionaires can afford it legally.    That’s all I’m leaving it to, cheers and criticisms are welcome JUST PLEASE KEEP IT CIVIL.Love Bernie... YangGang for life thoAmerica will never be a socialist country.  MAGA 2020.All the negative comments are the jackasses that probably didn&#39;t listen to itConcerning the minimum wage for minors/students, just work less hours...AND the company would hire more people, and before you talk about having to guarantee insurance, Medicare-for-all obviously.This was fucking shit. Why was it one hour long? Waste of my time shouldn’t have given Bernie even an hour.Now bernie is just being dishonest trying to frame it like lobbyists are mainly a thing to the GOP.  These 2 corrupt parties equally are at fault here.If you love the policies of other countries so much, run in those countries!! Stop trying to ruin it for the rest of us.Illusion of choice. They are all garbage. This fool doesn’t have a pair of balls , he bowed down to Hillary. This whole thing is a sham. If people use woke and politics in the same sentence. You’re still asleep! Illusion of choice 2020.Cancel student debt....<br /><br /><br />Reward the dumbfuck retards who majored in music. Great idea!Canadians come to America for healthcare because they can’t get in fast enough in Canada. That might be a little bit of a problem.Oh shitHere comes the people who equate social democracy to the USSRFuck this old piece of shit! Typical politician whose became a millionaire without working a day in his life!I would never put my trust into a socialistHe’s right about jobs leaving this country my company just shut down two huge factory’s that are being relocated in China so many people without jobs now smhGo back to your mom&#39;s basement roomI always thought that it was very odd that Bernie very rarely makes eye contact. I bet he’s got some real dark demons in his closet.Canadians spend way more on health care then Americans. Average household in Canada spends over $6000. While in America it’s about $3200. Bernie claimed we spend more per capita. If anyone has any thoughts about this please lmk, just be civil.Got a lot of great ideas that have never worked and have no idea how to pay for them......I see the trumptards are already disliking 😂<br />Bernie 2020I finished school with over 80k to the Federal gov and over 90k to a private loan company. This was after 3 1/2 years of school faculty spouted 90% job hiring after graduation.I love watching American politics LOLWhy do they never address the issue of inflation with the idea of the $15 minimum wage raise? Prices of everything will increase and then the affect you’re hoping for will be voided.  <br /><br />Also all the hopes and dreams he has sound great but they’re never explained with the methods on how he plans to achieve them. And the times he has mentioned it, it comes at the price of taxing everyone. Yes high and low income more than currently taxed? I think he has awesome ideas but he has a lot of holes in his tactics. <br /><br />Also seems to like Canada a lot maybe he should run up there lol&quot;You can&#39;t explain the complexity of healthcare in America in 45 seconds&quot; &quot;Da OnE pErcENt&quot;right we&#39;re not a great nationThe single biggest determinant to someone&#39;s future is their own personal philosophy. The problem with most of Bernie solutions is it tries to change the external situation of people vs their internal dialog and personal philosophy. Teaching upward mobility at the earliest ages, teaching business, financial education, etc is the real solution.&quot;I think we got a shot&quot; you humble man, i love you! You truly deserve to be the next president.Bernie Sanders is really winning me over here. He just seems so honest and passionateOkay this is epicI&#39;ve been waiting a long time for this. I hope you bring him back soon. I know he goes through the same shpiel a lot, but this long form is how you get past that. The answer about drugs being unnecessary if you have a good life was great.The ultimate softball interview.I wonder who Joe will vote for.......ohBernie is by far the most ethical Presidential candidateTulsi Gabbard have her back onBernie is extremely ignorant when it comes to tax. Businesses are not able to stash income over in the Cayman Islands after tax reform due to transition tax and GILTI.  Amazon doesn’t avoid tax due to tax loopholes. They are expanding, providing thousands of jobs around the country so they have a lot of new assets that qualify for bonus depreciation. Once their growth slows, the tax will come. He says broad comments that most people don’t understand to incite anger. Please don’t believe everything you hear!I’m only 2 minutes in and I just want to say ; I’ve been listening to Rogan for years.  I haven’t seen very many podcasts under 2 hrs .  I’m eager to see why this is cut short .  Much love America,  More Love !Are you fucking serious!?!?!? cant wait to finish this podcast holy fuck<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MYMAN">#MYMAN</a>!We the American people demand that wall street and billionaire corporations re-invest 10 trillion over the next ten years back into the society they have so brazenly robbed murdered and stole from.Bernie is a full blown retardBoth of these men support the notion that our planet is going to be uninhabitable in the near future.  Yet here they are talking about fuckin healthcare costs, gun laws, and the debate formats.  These 2 should write a reboot of Armageddon in which Bruce Willis updates his Dental plan and repaves his driveway while the Asteroid barrels toward the Earth.If the DNC and Clinton didn&#39;t screw him over in 2016, he would be President right now.DEMONcRAT, Party of CHAOSWhat&#39;s happening ...? ...?The guy who couldn&#39;t handle the VA wants to handle healthcare for 330,000,000 people. <br /><br />Smart.Bernie forgot Joe is the 1%.BERNIE SANDERS FOR PRESIDENT<br />THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTEJoe letbernie get away with the gun show loophole crap.Sure healthcare is free, the avg waiting time is 19 weeks! Thats average! No thank you, id rather pay 200 bucks a month and be guaranteed care when I need it.Bernie &quot;other countries&quot; SandersThis is great - I went into watching this to see what crazy Bernie had to say.  I watched with an open mind and Bernie is not so crazy after all.  Give a serious candidate time to discuss issues with intelligent questions from Joe and you  can learn a lot about them.  Not saying I agree with 100% of what Bernie said - but he does make a lot of sense on a lot of issues.  Thanks for giving him this platform to communicate Joe!  I hope many other candidates will as well.  Even the President and a few of the 3rd party candidates once the leaders are established.I love this podcast. Bernie should be the president in 2020 !!!Hot tip for all you American socialists out there. It’s not the corporate elite you need to worry about, it’s your gigantic corrupt government that is strangling your nation into oblivion. The bigger your government gets, the more DMT you’re gunna need. Good luck.I dont know how the right cant agree on the Health Care idea.Ugh, fuck this socialist.Ok, Bernie is demonstrating a disregard for basic economics as well as rewarding reckless behavior, instead of detailing everything I&#39;m just going to explain one point and you guys can look at the rest of what he said using some critical thinking. He said in response to saying that entry level jobs are for young people entering the workforce, that the &quot;reality&quot; is that kids are not working these jobs adults are working these jobs. In essence he admits we had a system where the young and inexperienced took jobs for very low wages in which the expectation is the employee will move on to a better job once they&#39;ve proven some competency. Then by saying adults are working these jobs long term he is continuing to literally argue that since these adults did not move on, and they did not work hard to maximize their earnings we must change the entire system to take care of them. Anyone who understands economics knows that those changes will hurt the inexperienced and the young, and those people are being hurt to correct the poor decisions of people who did not use the system as intended.<br /><br />This is wrong on so many levels, and I would love to hear a Bernie supporter explain to me how this is moral.Joe &quot;lefty&quot; RoganJoe Rogan has been infiltrated by corporate cronys long ago. At least we can see Comrade Sanders is not the answer to America&#39;s problem.Hes got my voteIf a fascist gov were to be established here we need to have weapons to fight back. Fuck Bernie, and fuck assault weapons ban.Healthcare is truly not a human right. We wouldn&#39;t have the most innovative and cutting edge healthcare coming out of America if we did not have a profit motive. It has become too painful to listen to Joe. After sitting down with some of the most intelligent people in the world, including economists, and he has learned nothing. It just doesn&#39;t stick no matter how many facts you give him.If we want to be really honest here............lobbying is nothing but legalized bribery, with all the wink-wink, nod-nod, you scratch my back kickbacks that Washington if famous for, and that fat, racist m.f. Trump has his nose in the trough like the rest of the piggies. Oink, oink.....Aside from all the stuff he says and thinks, can a 79 year old get enough votes to be POTUS? I mean that&#39;s an 83 year old seeking re-election...could be 87 while POTUS....just think of the health issues aloneI tried. I really did. But 20 minutes in and hes just repeating that he doesnt understand economics in several different ways.He&#39;s treating him like a teddy bear that&#39;s going to rip and scream if any hard questions are asked fuck that is the only reason I watched this cos I thought that he would have given it to him about his bullshit but no he doesn&#39;t have his sidekick fact checking ANYTHING ISN&#39;T THAT A BUT FUNNY USUALLY HE TRIES TO CAT H EVERYONE OUT ON ANYTHING HE CAN BUT THIS OLD CUNT GETS A PASS!???Assault weapons were designed to assault!?!?!?! 🤯🤯🤯🤯This should&#39;ve been 2-3 hours, but I bet Bernie has a tight schedule !He&#39;s too old we couldn&#39;t get Ron Paul in we can&#39;t get this guy.WOOOOOOOOOOPI stopped listening 7 minutes in after Sanders said healthcare was free in Canada. I live in Canada, and believe me our taxes are high as they include the cost of healthcare. Sanders didn&#39;t even hint at the fact that our healthcare costs are high. All he did was said it was free. Its not. Nor is the quality of the service in Canada that great. Many rich Canadian go to the US for health services cause it takes forever in Canada. Bernie glosses over the harsh realities and just wishes things were easy and free.I logged on to see this omg I’m so excited.STOP YELLING AT ME, BERNIE!pretty sure you can talk as long as you want on Cspan Bern dawg.I wonder which of his mansions Bernie is considering socialism from tonight...Thanks Joe! It&#39;s amazing that any find Bernie&#39;s platform controversial.Bernie career politician, 1%er, millionaire, the face of what&#39;s wrong in Washington today. Where were you the last 40 years Bernie?Came into this thinking it would be a bunch of bullshit and wasn&#39;t disappointedMan made climate change is a joke.anyone think if weed was legalized we&#39;d have less shootings? I bet those psychos who go shooting people hitting some indica would chill outBernie next debate: DMT should be legalized nationwide!1 hour? Only the top 1 percent of guests don’t do 2.Fook this commieNo shitGo Bernie !DUDE WHAT THE FUCKWhy did I automatically liked it before I started listening? Ahh thank you!!!increase minimum wage for FULL TIME EMPLOYEES if your part time like most students you get paid a part time wageGross. Populism is cancer to progress.Bernie should start an asmr channelPoint of privilege; please be respectful in the comment section and please don&#39;t misgender anybody.get andrew yang back on😎BernIf Joe lets his beard and hair grow, he&#39;s the human old face app.His heart is in the right place but I don&#39;t think he knows how to get to where he wants to go...This idiot came on Joe&#39;s podcast? WowDon&#39;t pass Bernie the blunt... his wet ass lips will put it outJoe thanks for hitting him on the marijuana issue!!!This fuckin podcast just gets worse and worse. After all these years you are officially unsubscribedi am not American, but i just wonder how can you be against free health care and hate Bernie Sanders<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=8m04s">8:04</a> niceyesss buzzing for thisA multimillionaire talking about spending everyone else&#39;s tax money, but jipping his staff out of their money.... yay... go next communist... dictator... woo... hoo....Bernie &quot;Bernie I gotta tell ya&quot; SandersYour talking about minimum wage on corporations, not giving any thought to mom and pop shops who get screwed. Then all we will have is those major corporations left. Then they get even richer.  Its crazy.  All hes says what he wants , not how he will implement what he wants.  I need more info. All I know is I own a buisness and I get taxed so damn hard.  I kniw I already pay more taxes then the majority of us citizens.  I would not be able to make it if I had to pay more taxes.One fiscal moron interviewing another. You don’t get a pass on math because you think you’re gonna save the world.Kinda shortI like Joe Rogan&#39;s questioning, he gives people just enough rope to hang themselves. He doesn&#39;t need to push he&#39;s allowing their guests to speak. I disagree with Bernie Sanders on several issues but this is better than 45 seconds in a debateGo off king!god damn Joe still no Kanye though?It takes months to get any health care in Canada stop trying to use them as an exampleIs there like a.. highlight-reel of this boring shitt?<br /><br />JK just vote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>I wonder how long of a list of topics joe got from Bernie’s staff that was “off limits”.Bernie please read &quot;Basic Economics&quot;.You’d have to be an idiot to choose Joe Biden over this guy!!Well...if everyone just joined the military, go to some wars and Uncle Sam will sort of pay for school..I speak out term I&#39;ve only ever known and been related to service personal, but they did get some school paid for?? Not worth the consequences if you ask me.So this is the 3rd DNC one. Are you also going to invite the current president?The mental health crisis is a direct result of our culture.Go after the gun manufacturers.       Limit supplyAnyone that has smelled Marijuana before: <br /><br />Joe: So how do you feel about the legalization of MJ?Tulsi is the best option for Democrats,  yang is the second best, Bernie third&quot;I wish we I could say you can have what ever weapon you want&quot;.... You need to abide by the fucking constitution &quot;Shall not be infringed&quot; means more than your emotional response. There are THOUSANDS of gun laws right now that infringe on our 2nd Amendment rights. I think we have conceded enough on that bullshit argument. Just say you want a GUN BAN, and that you don&#39;t want law abiding citizens to defend themselves against these types of threats.Bernie <b>&quot;someone came up to me about this topic and said something that suppports my case&quot;</b> SandersExplain how you&#39;re going to keep hospitals open with medicaid and Medicare payouts. Without private insurance, over half will close and ANY hospital administrator will tell you that. What will that do for care and wait times? Answer that and I might consider.Nope.Well done joeI&#39;m just going to say I don&#39;t want assault weapons banned, my opinion.&quot;have you ever tried DNC?&quot;a small business paying someone $ 15.00 an hr will have to give their employees a raise because they dont want to make only minimum wage. Many small business cant afford that, so they will lay them off or close their doors. I cant watch anymore of this Im outCommieLOL.....initial comments ended it for me.  He should be happy that he only has 45 seconds to explain his programs as they are nonsense with NO substance.It&#39;s about time .This is clearly joe helping out the Democrats he’s s fucking ponyFirst they came for the top 1% and I did not speak because I&#39;m not part of the top 1%.<br />Then they came for the middle class and I did not speak because I&#39;m not middle class.<br />Then they came for the poor and I did not speak because I&#39;m not poor.<br />Then they came for me<br />And there was no one left<br />To speak out for me.I cant listen to this shit. I dont hate sanders, but you cant believe him. The United States is not Canada! Do you think Canada uses the US like sanders does as a an example? The grass is always greener.... right?This guy is not president material. I’d rather have trump bossing other country’s around for 4 years who rip us tf off then a open armed retardLarry David has Curbed His EnthusiasmJoe should hold the presidential elections.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=58m59s">58:59</a> Joe asks Bernie about DMTtell me more about these open bordersBernie is the chillest candidate, and one of the most sensible. Sad how the mainstream media prefers literally every other candidate running. If Kanye ran for president, the media would prefer him over Bernie.Bernie dodged the drug question<br /> Doesnt understand harm reduction. <br />Vote for Yangmy 2nd amendment stays intactJoe should host a couple candidates at once and let them discuss topics at length!  That would be revolutionary.&quot;old man yells at cloud&quot;This is my list of problems with B.S. <br /><br />1) most medical innovation has come from the American free market and not socialised medicare country&#39;s.<br /><br />2) Health Care can&#39;t be a right because you can&#39;t force people to be in the medical field. People don&#39;t have to be doctors and nurses. You are born with rights, they can&#39;t be provided by others. The right to free speech,    personal protection (guns), life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Many more but health care is not one of them. <br /><br />3) when you go to school and get a degree in a field that has no jobs that is your fault, I should NEVER have to pay your loan. And if you did get a degree and can&#39;t &quot;find&quot; a job...get your butt up and move to a new state.<br /><br />5) stop all government backed student  loans, ALL!! <br /><br />5) a $15 dollar minimum wage is crap... make it $5 and better yourself for a better job. If you raise it everything will go up with it. A high tide will raise all boats. <br /><br />6) there is NO SUCH THIS AS AN assault weapon. This is a lie, you have single shot, single shot automatic and full automatic. If you want people to be safe get government out of the gun business. <br /><br />There is more but I&#39;m on my phone and old B.S. is not going to win thank God. But Joe, thank you for having him on and the other candidates that you have had on. Great work!!!You can get a presidential candidate to the show but not Keanu Reeves<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=21m00s">21:00</a> <b>Raising the minimum wage screws over small business owners, which is most business owners.</b><br /><b>Imagine that you own a pizza place. You have four kids working for you who all work for $8.00 an hour, a wage you all agreed on. Let’s say they each work about 20 hours a week. This makes your yearly labor costs about $33,280.00. However, the federal government comes in and demands that you start paying your workers $15.00 an hour. Your new yearly labor cost is now $62,400.00, nearly double what it was. You can’t afford that, so you either have to fire two kids or drastically reduce everyone’s hours. Neither outcome is desirable.</b><br /><br /><b>In short, there shouldn’t be a federal minimum wage. The government doesn’t decide what jobs are worth. The market does.</b>White guilt coward billionaire joe Rogan. PosPoor people dont like socialism because they already have so much government controll over their lives, and see how  government works day to day. Government is full bureaucracy, with everyone&#39;s hand in it and becomes an extremely inefficient and slow process.Please, America, get this one right and vote for Bernie Sanders in 2020. A rational, reasonable man who sides with logic and good sense with integrity and strong ethics is not only what the USA needs, but the world stage can also benefit from such a leader.Why doesn&#39;t Bernie give up some of his extra houses? <br /><br />I mean if all of us are supposed to give up so much?Bernie is right abt politicians air time in the uk but only at an election time.Joe I hope you have a major right wing politician on your show to expand on the other side of these ideas. Bernie is giving you all the marketing, but no info on side effects, how it would work, how it would be paid for, what they would have to do to pay for it, how it would effect the economy. Love you breh but you don&#39;t have good counters, this thing is basically a marketing video for Bernie, not a fair interview. He went unchallenged on ANYTHING. If his ideas were so perfect we&#39;d all agree, they need to be challenged so people can get the full story and context.Joe Rogan for president.Bernie has his pulse on the right issues but I can’t say I agree with his vision for how to handle them. I think the energy from his coalition is shifting away from him too. Good guy, means well, won’t winBernie is the most disgusting fraud alive today, and that&#39;s saying a LOT.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=40m50s">40:50</a> Uh, that is how America operates, actually. I could get arrested for possessing benign and medicinal plant material (cannabis and psychedelics) which is laughable considering death is an absolute impossibility, as is physiological dependence. The irony is that weapons, obviously, can be used to harm yourself and others.I am the Shade.Can&#39;t wait to see a Trump on the podcast that would be interesting to say the least 😗👌When Bernie Sanders looks at the american people he sees it&#39;s people, human beings. When people like trump look at the american people he sees dollar signs and fools. And then here comes a hard strung Republican to comment on this &quot;but guns and the wall and fuck everyone that isnt me&quot;. Go ahead, I&#39;m waiting. Btw I&#39;m independent, I belong to no party.He seems like a good dude, but he doesn&#39;t actually have any plans but a small tax on trading and banning assault weapons. Nothing he is proposing is simple. Gathering people to make a change doesn&#39;t really mean anything but we will force our will on those who attempt to oppose our way of thinking. What we have certainly learned in this day and age is the loudest people aren&#39;t always the correct people. Kudos for having him on though. Decent podcast, just wish you would have actually asked some harder questions like hey if you believe in a living wage why weren&#39;t you paying your staff one... But whateverI like Bernie. But he also has no idea how drugs are developed or he doesn’t like to explain it to voters. It takes roughly 10 years and there is ZERO guarantee that the drug will even work and gain FDA approval. Not only that, they may never make all the money they spent back. Also, the US does negotiate with healthcare and so do insurance companies. Drug prices are not just the only problem with health care but you have to balance drug costs with encouraging innovation, particularly with rare disease. If you do not balance them companies like Sarepta or Vertex will not exist.Podcasts are the best way to get your message across as a political candidateWell we can&#39;t argue anymore about where Rogan&#39;s politics lie. This was a hard podcast to watch. What a tool Rogan and his podcast have become.Ask homie if he needs a drink or something so he can clear his throat Joe . WTF.He&#39;s real and this country has shit reality shows/YouTube stars to prove it doesn&#39;t do it well.Bernie &quot;talked to a woman last night trying to go to college and take care of her family&quot;.   Sound like someone should be grateful to those pharmaceutical companies!B; An assault weapon as you know is a military style weapon<br />Wrong.I would have agreed with him 6 years ago before I seen through the charade. . It&#39;s amazing how smart people can be attracted to the emotional trapping of a flawed idea!! What happens when the golden calf industrious types jump ship and your social expenditure is through the roof and there is nothing left to milk.. chaos, destruction and history repeating itselfIf you ran your finances like Bernie wants to run the US finances you would be bankrupt in 2 seconds.And how long do you have to wait for that surgery Bernie?Bernie “ I talked to this guy” SandersYou will never get rid of the guns its an almost pointless endeavor (not to say its a bad idea). The most realistic approach is to combat the lack of morality in today&#39;s society. The lack of the nuclear family, lack of community, the promotion of nihilism is isolating people and forcing them to snap. You fix these areas and you wont have these shooters in such a mass. Adding restrictions and bans will only crunch on these people causing them to snap sooner (and in greater mass).<br /><br /><br />Its actually that simple.Pog claps in chat lolBernie: lobbying is killing us                          also Bernie: be right back i need to cash this checkBernie is a nihilist who burns Masonic Bibles. Trump 2020.Great dude. Wouldn&#39;t trust him a lemonade stand, but great dude nonetheless.Misconception that he wants to take your money lmao.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>Bernie talks complete senseThere is no limit for Joe, he probably will get Trump on this too. <br /><br />I declare Joe Rogan the king of media.Gauruntee trump dont have the bernie balls to go on joe rogan.Civilians need semi-automatic tactical rifles (assault rifles) like children need firearmsLong format conversations are so much better. Bernie didn&#39;t really change my mind on any of his solutions but he did bring up some good observation of problems that we do have. I hope Joe brings on more politicians in the future and hopefully he can bring them from both sides. So far I have only seen democrats on his show this year....as far as people actually running for officeThe Berndog! Woof Woof Woof!The Canadian health care system is not perdect people die because the waiting lines can take 10 hoursThe socialism is strong with this oneIf you want to see 2 millionaire socialists talk about how to help poor people, watch the Joe Rogan podcast with Bernie Sanders. It&#39;s funny to see rich people promote socialism yet they won&#39;t share any of their money 🤔Russian trolls incomingggggg LOLOLL 🤣😂🤣What a crazy fuckAs a libertarian here is my problem with people like Bernie Sanders, his ideas sound great it sounds like a utopian society but here’s the catch. How do you expect to pay for this stuff? Medicare for all, education reform, early child care, environmental changes, FREE (lol) Education, minimum wage to living wage to name a few ... any idea what that costs? Who pays for it? TAXPAYERS PAY FOR IT.  So what do you think happens? Most people who go paycheck to paycheck all of a sudden have 50-70% of their paycheck going to Uncle Sam for This utopian Society. It’s not feasible for Millions of Americans just like me. I make $55-$60k a year. I have a wife and 2 small kids who rely on me to take care of them and put food on the table. I can’t afford for 60%  my paycheck to go to Bernie’s fantasy for society, as great as that society would be it’s not possible. Don’t let these politicians fill your head with this shit. They will rob you, create MASSIVE DEBT and say it’s for all the FREE shit!!!! No such thing as free ladies and gentlemen.Get on Slavoj Zizek. That would be hilarious.Trump where you at?Bernie is so fuckin stupidI think health care Canada is not the best. So many people Canada for free  health and don&#39;t pay for it. And the middle classe Candida pays for itTwo shills, WOW really interesting , give me a goddamn breakJust for a second, try to picture Donald Trump getting on the JRE Podcast and having an in depth intellectual conversation on hard hitting policy matters. Obviously that would never happen. Then ask yourself, does DJT really have the capacity to be President of the United States?ok well first off no to the Stock taxI love Bernie&#39;s asmr voice lolAs expected, all platitudes with little actual explanation of how to implementI&#39;m so hyped for this podcastit is fake news that hospital stays are &quot;free&quot; in canada. there are actual charges beyond our taxes for hospital rooms and other fees. do not be spreading fake news. canadians flock to the US all the time for medical treatment. i have had issues with my foot and ankle for about 10 years and all of my surgeries have been cancelled  by the hospitals due to lack of funding repeatedly, so i just stopped booking. i&#39;ll limp once in a while rather than keep getting cancelled surgeries. i am a contributor. my surgeries get cancelled. imagine if i become disabled in any significant way? who is paying in? not single moms. not disabled people. its a serious problem. if i (and others like me) stop paying in, who pays? the whole thing comes downMy dislike for this video is for BERNIE 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽The military shouldn&#39;t be a separate entity from the civilians should be equivalent because civilians should be defending the nation. And on top of that you need to have exactly every weapon possible to make the Government piss their pants every time they make a law.Fuck you Joe!  what a pussy, the shooter was racist smh “mental health issues “ i used to love joe but starting to notice a trend with him , Bryan, Brendan .Unbelievable, Bernie is on JRE! Best politician I know.<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Joe:  can I come on the show and explain why this is all wrong?<br />Please!  I fear for our futurewhen people say keep Government out of our healthcare the reply should be keep Greed out of healthcare,Education and Justice systemif the DNC didn&#39;t rig it so KIllary would be the candidate, imo, Bernie woulda been presidentI feel like Bernie is a good man who has been led to believe a bunch of bs. He seems like he genuinely wants to see America thrive and do well (which is more than you can say for a lot of politicians), but he is held back by the virtue signalling progressives in his team.If he doesn’t bring up getting rid of private insurance or getting rid of employer based plans, which most Americans are for, I’ll be disappointedMic Jagger left the EU &amp; came to the U.S for his heart surgery,  why would that be?Ok , i dont agree with bernie on pretty much anything , buy comin on the joe rogan podcast earns him massive respect 👍Joe, you are the man. Love the questions you are asking. Not afraid to get controversial and speak the truth.Presidents are an outdated concept, but Id rather have someone who&#39;s at the very least, not a reality TV show host. Is that too much to as for? It&#39;s turned our political system into a fucking game show.I vote for an Israeli system for healthcareI wouldn&#39;t vote for him in a million years but I love Joe for bringing on people from all political views! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TrumpJRE">#TrumpJRE</a>How is this the world we are living in? 😂15 an hour to flip burgers or take orders vs 20 an hour to do actual skilled hard labor.... seems fair Bernie! How about those adults get a real job...? Completely missed the point.Bernie Sanders ASMRAll you in the US, VOTE BERNIE!!!Im from EU and the whole healthcare topic in the US is so fking strange... why wouldnt you want free healthcare? The Gov taxes us 50% on loan but were fine paying that.End corporate personhood, you end corporate right to lobby/bribe politicians and you end inverted totalitarianism aka corporate fascism.whatIf you have a job that most people can learn to perform in a day or two you do not deserve $15 an hour. It’s your fault you were dumb enough to have kids when you can’t even take care of yourself. There are always circumstances so I’m not saying “everyone” I’m all for programs to help out your children in that case but not at all for paying you more.This should be interesting 👍🏼👍🏼Why are you americans so obsessed with guns?Disgusting manBet there would be 100x less shootings in America if we take guns from the police. Police were shooting the same moment as a gunman an the gunman an his sister an 8 other people died yet the only person saying who killed who are cops. Sounds like bullshitNo wayNot feeling the bern,  however I would like to see more candidates on the Joe Rogan Podcast.They haven&#39;t raised the minimum wage in over 10 yrs?? They raised it just a few years ago?Omg was about to go to bed but now...<br />Bernie-Warren for 2020 guys!<br />And remember, DMT is a human right folks!Getting kind of political here, but I’m digging it. Have to say, Rogan, asked some good questions. It’s interesting how many times Mike Baker 👨‍🍳 has been on pre and post candidate interviews. 👽Joe how do you feel making s real difference... good intelectual show broHow is this only a hour?<b>Joey Diaz voice</b> : TremendousBernie should have done 2 hours. What could he possibly be doing that would be more important?99.9% Will never in a billion years do anything wrong BUT a few did so to hell with ur rights. NOT ONE D*MN WORD ABOUT EVERY D*MN DAY, EVERY PLATFORM U LOOK AT IS NAZI, RACIST, WHATEVER ISM U CAN MAKE UP.....NOW GET IN UR TRIBES AND F*CK THEM OVER THERE. Couldn&#39;t possibly be the BIGGEST D*MN PROBLEM in this country right now. No call out..... Just BS and feel goods that won&#39;t fix SH*T.oh fuck yeahHe&#39;s too Jewish to be presidentSo what he wants to actually do?Oh baby cant wait to hear from Kyle KulinskiAs Canadian  or healthcare is far from perfect as well. You can wait a longggggggg time for surgeries and MRI ect.Bernie is the only candidate worth voting for.Of course get an from a drug company as they are talking about itdon&#39;t mind me here to read the commentsWtf? 95% of all guns are assault weapon. Bernie’s a fucking moron.Is it just me or is Bernie not answering Joe&#39;s questions?  He&#39;s doing the exact same thing he would do on a presidential debate -deflecting.I&#39;m 42, worked my ass off to pay off student loans. Is Bernie going to write me a check or only reward the people who don&#39;t pay them off?Whaaaaatt.. but still trump 2020I believe this will boost Bernie&#39;s approval rating.Give Bernie some water! lolGet Trump onas someone from a country where healthcare is basically free, don&#39;t do it, you&#39;ll ruin your healthcare system.<br />waiting times are huge and treatment is okay at bestImagine having Trump. It would be the biggest podcast everSanders is a communist scumbag who only showed up on Rogan because he knows Rogan is going to put Tulsi in the White House. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PILF">#PILF</a>I&#39;m Bernie Sanders. and I complain about 45 minutes for the air time and then prop up the Russia for giving you 30 what an idiot!!!😂how bad is his breath?LOL! I had to read the screen  two times!&quot;Omg he is so old&quot; everyone below 20<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m40s">34:40</a> cracked me the fuck up 😂😂😂Only 1 hour???Bernie needs to relax Rogan stye. Maybe his ideas would sound better.The knife crime in the UK now is far more welcome after watching your fucking shit show of a situationTRUMP2020LOW ENERGYIt is sad that Joe isn&#39;t laying down any facts and not challenging this guys beliefs. These are the same boring questions everyone asks.“No I’m not gonna take your money....”<br />Lol<br />But you can’t fix our healthcare system by taxing the American public. It’s healthcare for profit and pharmaceutical companies. AGREED<br />So...how you gonna fix it?<br />... we are gonna erase student loan debt and raise minimum wage.<br />🙄Joe needs to have Vlad on so he can tell him the Tupac story.Boy howdy this comment section tis getting rowdyFuck SocialismImagine Bernie, Tulsi, and Yang all having a civil conversation on Joe Rogans podcast at the same time. He really should host the next round of debates lolWhen Bernie sits down and really talks about a subject he comes off as a relatable, caring guy. But his split second reactions the last 6+ years tells me he is not this cool headed when he makes decisions.  I don&#39;t want him near the presidency , but I don&#39;t Hate the guy because of thayJoe Hogan is the future of political discussion in America. Get them all on, give them all an hour. Millions of views each. Well worth the hour of their time.Congrats you had the next president of the united states on your showfor someone who hunts Joe seems to know dick about gunsWHAT!? Yes! So excited! <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>This guy is out of his mind, you CAN BE IN A TRADE AND BE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS.  Bernie is so fucking out of touch with reality it boggles my mindAll of yall that support full blown socialism need to be booted out the US.Jiminy Cricket making a comeback I see.There is a God.I haven&#39;t even started hearing the podcast yet and I&#39;m only already at holyshit! Is it possible Joe Rogan can get Donald Trump on the podcast?Bernie is speaking at a normal volume because he hit the blunt with Joe before the podcast started.Like Bernie or not, there is real injustice in this country, and the powers that be would rather have everyone just turn the other way instead of seeing it for what it is. Realistically, we are talking about a price of insulin that basically almost extorts you to choose between life and death. Apparently, &#39;whatever the market will bear&#39; borders on the edge of death. And indeed, most people are willing to pay for this ridiculous price. And the problem is that it&#39;s so cartoonishly evil that you almost couldn&#39;t even imagine reality being this way. The fact is, I genuinely have a hard time believing that the elites in this country are behaving like mustached psychopaths, but when you compare the price of insulin to Canada right next door, it&#39;s pretty hard to deny this reality.&quot;That&#39;s kinda what I wanna do &quot;  holy shitStop bringing up human rights like it means something It&#39;s a piece of paper that everyone breaks and accuses others of breaking when it suits them. It&#39;s a joke. the natural order is the only authority.Joe Rogan should host a debate between Donald Trump and the Democratic nomineeCool to have a presidential candidate on, but FUCK SOCIALISM.I consider myself conservative but Tulsi or Yang are the only 2 dems I wouldn&#39;t be upset about. Everyone else is a hard no for me..Dont like him feeding him answersAny radical conservative needs to listen to this whole thing before they talk shit about Bernie. The media scares people of Bernie but this should make it clear that his policies are sound.I want to fact check this because the at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m00s">4:00</a> I feel like he is lieing about the free air time in the UK that sounds bullshitFree shit!Just 12 minutes in you get a sense Bernie really has a sense of whats really going on in this country<a href="http://bernieiswrong.com/">bernieiswrong.com</a>I prefer Andrew Yang but also respect Bernie.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=8m04s">8:04</a> <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=12m21s">12:21</a><br />This guy really loves the number 69😉quite literally, he has been saying the SAME SHIT for 30 years.Bernie looks like he&#39;s about to kick the bucket gheeshMy man Bernie 🥰🥰🥰Damn Bernie say something new please! You’re putting me to sleep!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SANDERSROGAN2020">#SANDERSROGAN2020</a>Dont agree with all the points, but it&#39;s great to see him sit down for a podcast like this and have good conversation, havent seen the whole thing yet but imagine he is the same throughout.Not a Bernie fan. But respect he comes on to the podcast. Unfiltered, real, and to the point. Gets more than the &quot;12 second&quot; response.Here&#39;s a clue Bernie, raise taxes on the rich and they take their money and go elsewhere. This guy who has been in politics forever and never had a real job, but has 3 homes, has no clue how the real world works.The drug price program has been addressed by trump Mr SandersHoly shit Bernie FUCKING Sanders, fuck yeah.Beautiful.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BERNIE2020">#BERNIE2020</a> he is the ONLY CANDIDATE WHO HAS FOUGHT HIS ENTIRE LIFE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VOTE HIM IN GUYS VOTE HIM 🗳Wow I’m no Bernie fan but good on you Joe for getting such a big interviewHoly shit I thought the title was a parodyDon’t agree with Sanders idea, but wish Trump would come on the podcast I bet could get Trump Jr Colby didBernie &quot;Dual Citizenship&quot; Sanders.You are killing it Joe. You should host a round table of all the candidates. That would actually make some progress in our politicsThis will be the largest viewing podcast JRE has ever done.Let&#39;s see what Side Joe panders too today.Fuck Bernie the commie bastards.<br />He should be shot for treason!JRE is the best &quot;free&quot; campaign rally bernie could have done.Couple of things:<br />- You aren&#39;t LBJ, you aint got the fists, and rough enough life, for that kinda fight<br />- This isn&#39;t 1965, D.C. has changed a lot since then<br />- Who are the drug companies reaching, spending that dumb as hell amount, to do Ad a smear campaign on TV, we just said nobody watches TV, so the youth need to get out and vote<br />- You raise minimum wage to 15, what about small hometown-downtown businesses? How does an average person start a business from nothing then?Is Donald Trump next?!?!?One more healthcare bs and I&#39;m gonna kick his head to Mars. Corporations own govt and 1000 Sanders cant do shit. LosetSemi full automatic fully extended clip banana scope with a purple plated trigger I’m a gun control moron take always guns blah stfu Bernie you commie.we need to stop supporting the oligarchy, places like the JRE helps balance the power of those who write the narrative in mainstream mediaI&#39;m glad you put the DMT down and picked up politics 🙌 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23onedayatatime">#onedayatatime</a>Hopefully one day he has Trump on so he can officially call out all the fake bullshit the media lies on him daily. Maybe wake some people upGuns are not our right because we need to protect ourselves from other people. They are our right because we need to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government! We need assault weapons.Fuck Bernie Sanders this is one podcast I’ll be skipping<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m37s">2:37</a> I&#39;m seriously boredI feel kind of bad for Bernie. He doesn&#39;t feel comfortable talking about some things because he knows that if he does, he&#39;s going to be smeared to hell by a dishonest political machine. When you&#39;re fighting for things as important as healthcare and climate change and you know you have a real shot of changing those things, the pressure on what you say must be immense.I like Bernie, but he&#39;s just too old for the job.... but man i like his ideasI could&#39;nt listen to him any more after 5 minutes! Just hearing his voice annoys me! In a perfect world there would be universal health care. But why should people that have no physical or mental issue get free health care when hard working tax payers are the ones footing the bill? Is that fair? Bernie would open our southern border and let illegals flock to our country! Does he think hard working American tax payers should have to pay for them also? Is that really fair? HELL NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nothing is free when other people are paying for it!I&#39;ve lived in Canada 25 years (my entire life), any US citizen who says universal health care does not work is ignorant and lying to you. It&#39;s saved the lives of countless people I know, myself included. I have an auto-immune disease and had heart surgery at 12 years old at the Hospital for Sick Kids... if we id not have universal health care I would be dead. So would a lot of other people I know.<br />Please, educate yourselves. Universal health care works and your politicians know it. Bernie is absolutely right, it is NOT a radical idea.Proud of you, Joe.Bring Jessey Ventura and Alex Jones in the same showBet he wouldnt go on interveiw with Ben Shapiro. Joe isn&#39;t asking him the hard questions. What happens when the government receives massive amount of money and power how much more corruption will be spawned. How many future generations will suffer from bigger government that Bernie wants.I don&#39;t like Bernie Sanders nor do i agree with most of his policies, but he just earned a MUCHO amount of my respect for doing this interview with Rogan.Time - +<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=50m00s">50:00</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=57m36s">57:36</a>Lie counter: 678283.

A basic question on minimum wage tripped up bernie lmao guy has no breakdown to his policiesThe rich pay the vast majority of taxes.First <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m20s">23:20</a> - ASMR Bernie<br /><br /><b>cough</b><br /><br /><b>ANGRY BAERNIE ACTIVATED</b><br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m20s">23:20</a> ITS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE (FUCKING) LAWS JOE!IF you buy guns legallly why would someone sell them to criminal unlesss they weren&#39;t real &quot;Citizens&quot; {i.e. cabal or criminals)Bernie!!!!!!!!!Auto-likedOh god this should be interestingHe compares cost of care between disproportionate countries.Healthcare should be a human right, not a privilege afforded by the wealthy. Sure the NHS in the UK isn’t perfect, but today it proved its worth.<br /><br />Today I so nearly lost my daughter. <br /><br />She fell while hiking with me and my family. She fell down a steep hill nearly 60ft and cracked her head on a big tree. We were waiting with her, and some amazingly helpful strangers for more than an hour before more than 20 people arrived, both mountain rescue volunteers and paid paramedics. A helicopter was flown in and took her to the nearest hospital. It terrifies me to think what the bill for several ambulances, a helicopter and paramedics, outstanding nurse care and multiple scans and xrays would have cost us were it not for the NHS.<br /><br />Despite worrying signs of head injury and abdominal injuries, it turns out the worst she suffered was a broken arm.<br /><br />I held my daughter in my arms with her head bleeding alarmingly for that long hour trying to keep her awake and conscious. <br /><br />Hold your nearest and dearest close. Vote for healthcare that takes care of everyone regardless of their income.<br /><br />Our bill for the incredible care we received today? £0.00Fucking Dems and republic assholes downvoting<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=38m00s">38:00</a> What Bernie is saying here is very frightening. He is willing to sacrifice possibly thousands of lives in order to save a few hundred. There are murders, break-ins, suicides, etc every single day that you never hear about. These amount to thousands of deaths a year, There are probably about 2-5 mass shootings every year killing a total of about a hundred people. These mass shootings are horrific and obviously you wish that they didn&#39;t occur but you can&#39;t ask Bob from rural Nebraska to give up his gun because these stupid people are committing mass shootings. It&#39;s just not going to happen,  I&#39;m sorry. I think Bernie has good intentions but he says some really dumb stuff, I don&#39;t agree with virtually anything he believes in but this right here is the scariest. That&#39;s why people are calling him a dictator.I enjoy seeing the candidates on the show.  Wish he would have spent more than an hour on the podcast.  Been watching joe for years and an hour is cutting it short (especially after joe says thia is your chance to explain your positions). Tulsi was on for over 2 hours.Any doctor you want huh? I wonder why my friends in Canada   Have to use <br /> The specialist assigned to their region.<br /><br />If there&#39;s anything serious going on where time is an issue... they tell me they have to either pay cash through the private sector or come to the United States.<br /><br /><br />The problem with Bernie is that hes never had a real job, hes never had real overhead and hes done nothing but public sector government work his entire life.<br /><br />Hes dangerously naive, and he loves to reference other countries, perhaps he needs to remember that we&#39;re not other countries.<br /><br />Just because other countries do it, is not an argument or a case to be made for us doing it as well.<br /><br /> Oh yes, but let&#39;s keep talking about how a country the size of Arizona should be a working example for a nation 50 plus times that size .<br /><br /> I guess he forgets that this is a Republic of 50 independent States, not a centralized totalitarian government that makes broad sweeping mandates.<br /><br />I know, States rights are a bitch when you&#39;re trying to push socialism.<br /><br />Other countries also cause hyperinflation and atrocities against its own population, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to advocate for that now are we?<br /><br />One argument that I am so tired of is the ridiculous reference to Canada.<br /><br />For one thing, powerful people all over the world despite what nation they come from, including the same countries  he is referring to as being so wonderful in health care, these people travel to the United States to get their major surgeries done.<br /><br />I grew up in Seattle, in Seattle premature babies had to be flown to Seattle from Canada because they didn&#39;t have the medical infrastructure or technology to care for premature children that needed to be incubated.<br /><br />Canada has a terrible 2 tier system, where the masses are on a cumbersome sluggish system where it takes a long time to get life saving diagnostics and imaging done while those with money go around the system and use private health care because they can afford it. <br />Or, they simply travel South of the border into the United States and get what they need taken care of.<br /><br />Canada is also a nation of only 30 million people. <br /> The entire country of Canada has less people then the state of California.<br /><br />Lett that sink in for a minute, one single state in the Union has more population than the entire country of Canada. <br /> The United States has over 350 million people, their comparable in any way.<br /><br />You also have the fact that Canada spends hardly anything on national defense, because they&#39;re next door to the United States that has a robust military system and will defend Canada no matter what.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t  have to spend on a military...it frees up a lot of bullshit to push ridiculous programs.<br /><br />This would be like a millennial living at home with his parents that doesn&#39;t have to pay rent, doesn&#39;t have to pay for groceries, doesn&#39;t have to pay for utilities.... lecturing a friend because a friend doesn&#39;t have the money to go out on the weekend  because they have to pay for groceries and rent and children to support and so on...<br /><br />It&#39;s real easy to forget how great everything is when you don&#39;t have those kind of responsibilities on the table.<br /> While there can be changes mahkamah rhetoric about health care being a human right, what exactly does that mean anyway?<br /><br />You can argue that health care should be included as a part of being a citizen of a nation able to support it, but when you start talking about human rights as if its inherently assumed, that&#39;s a different story.<br /><br /> Go out into the wild and try to explain to an Apex predator about your inherent human rights. <br /><br />Rights exist because of a stable governing system capable of upholding and acknowledging Those rights. You have a right to not have things arbitrarily taken away from you, such as the right to life, the right of freedom and so on. <br /><br />But when you try to say you have a right to something that requires the forced participation and services of another individual, that&#39;s a completely different story and now you&#39;re trying to argue for the rights of one by trampling on the rights of another.<br /><br /> Are you going to hold a gun to a doctor&#39;s head and say he is forced to conduct surgery on another because the person&#39;s right to surgery outweighs the doctor&#39;s right to not have to perform an action he does not wish to do so?<br /> If the doctor wants to cancel his private family time or vacation to stay home and provide services for a person in need, that must be The Choice of the doctor and come from a genuine place, not be an action forced by a government that takes the independence and freedom away from that doctor and forces them through the threat of violence to carry out a service and action on another person or there will be punished for failure in doing so.<br /><br />This is the naive necessary totalitarian side of socialism that is a false claim of utopia, because no matter how you spin it it, it would require the enslavement and forced labor of individuals in order to serve the others deemed deserving. <br /> You now have an entire medical system of doctors, nurses and supporting staff that would be forced and required to provide a service on other individuals not because of willingness, but because a governing body Stati g they have no choice in the matter.<br /> Be careful not to fall into false promises of utopia. <br /><br />Sanders is an unrealistic idealogue who allows dogmatic naive world views to dictate his reality.<br /><br />It&#39;s a sad joke.Now we need trump on the podcastAll I read is .   I’m not a fan of Bernie but .... man fk off he’s the only one not take corporate pack moneyweak old man unfit to lead, only fit to pander.🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿 All of you mayo&#39;sWhere does corporation get the funds to pay taxes?  US the tax payers!I’m not a sanders supporter but joe did a good job here, I hope he’ll get the other candidates tooMedia companies should give him free air time. When YouTube is bigger than cable, he should also have the right to appear on whoever’s broadcast he wants to.Jesus christ...you are all a bunch of dumb mutherfukers if this man isnt electedLmao Bernie is a dorkSupport blue collar...Any politician that becomes a multi-millionaire after getting elected is corrupt.  Bernie Sanders isn&#39;t a poor man.  It doesn&#39;t make any difference if the US switches from fossil fuels and focuses on reversing climate change if the rest of the world is still treating the Earth like its dumpster.   Does Bernie think criminals are going to be nice and legally buy their guns?  And why when democrats speak about gun violence is it always mass shootings involving white men?  The majority of gun violence is black on black gang members in the inner city and Democrats won&#39;t discuss it because blacks overwhelmingly vote democrat and get NOTHING from the party in exchange for their vote.I wonder if Obama would ever go on JRE and have an unedited conversationMan people can hate on Bernie as much as they want, but you can tell he genuinely cares about people. This isn’t some dude with a pretty haircut, a thousand dollar suit and a nice smile, he’s really worked up about how shitty the poor are treatedHe literally tried to make a point based off of not knowing what tuition at a specific school cost in the past, and also not knowing what it costs now. Wot lolOK WHO CROSSED THE BEAMS<br />WHICH MAD SCIENTIST FLIPPED REALITY<br />THIS IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY&#39;S DEMOCRATIC PROCESS HAS BECOMEBernie has 2 assistants: one to wake him up, the other to tell him what day it isready to watch it!!!  Where&#39;s Yang? hahahaFuck yes!!I&#39;m waiting for Donald Trump to get on the show. Come on do itFully triggered.Raving lunatic.  Human caused climate change is a massive hoax and a tax grab.  The planet is actually entering a cooling cycle due to a grand solar minimum.damn they got bernie on jre. I&#39;m about to crip walk all over a copy of atlas shrugged while i listen to thisTOURNAMENT STYLE DEBATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Get Mike Rowe and Chris Voss on hereI would have a lot more respect for the left if they weren&#39;t such appeasers of Islamists like Sarsour. Also their open borders policies are complete madness.You know the avergae wait time for the er is in canada. Freaking liar man its weeks.I dont agree with everything Bernie says, but he truly wants to change America for the better and has for decades. Hes got my vote out of all the other guys.DespairAnyone wanting to save money on prescription medication should check out <a href="http://honeybeehealth.com/">honeybeehealth.com</a>. They’re cutting out the middlemen and corruption, no insurance needed. They’re based out of Culver City CA and are real people saving Americans money.Enjoyable to hear a politician speak of the popular media in this manner.<br />Enjoyable that a popular new media cat gives said politician a long form chance to speak.<br />The possibilities are wondrous. <br />The denizens are able to hear, think, do their own research,  think more and then vote.<br />Go team!<br />Be well folks<br /><br />OK,  a bit further in. It is the college&#39;s acting as cooperations,  gobbling up property and involving their power over towns that raised the cost of tuition. They are the fiends that drove tuitions so high. And, make no mistake they are demonic. Basic marketing diploma,  not even a degree, is 30000$. Boo.Not a fan but Joe should get Trump on it would be yuuuge<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m40s">34:40</a> lolThat&#39;s it, Joe Rogan is on a next level.Tulsi Bernie 2020!!!!They (corporations) don’t make the laws.  Bernie Sanders does.  He has been a politician for decades and accomplished nothing.How do you know when Joe Rogan truly respects his guest? He doesn&#39;t say &quot;pull that sucker about a fist length away from your face&quot;. Instead, he does it FOR THEM!America, do the right thing. Get this man to lead your country - he&#39;s the real deal.This guy is a joke. Fucking socialist - who do you think is going to pay for your ‘non radical’ health care?!?! Not some fucking bum who feels entitled to handouts. It’s going to be the working class people of this country.<br /><br />Keep your socialist propaganda - I’ve increased my wealth 3 x since we’ve had a republican leader. <br /><br />I’m voting red allllllllll day&quot;I can go in, pass a background check. By a dozen guns, and then sell them to criminals.&quot; Yes, you can. You will then be arrested when they trace that weapon back to you.... &quot;Assault weapons are weapons of Mass Destruction.&quot; There is no such thing as an Assault Weapon. You want to ban all semi-automatic weapons, and leave us to defend ourselves with flint lock, and muskets.Yang Gang 2020Bernie: &quot;Over the last 30 years the top 1% has seen a $21 Trillion increase in their wealth, while the bottom 50% has seen a $900 billion decline in their wealth.<br /><br /><br />Trump:  &quot;Let&#39;s cut taxes for the top 1% and take away essential programs for the rest of Americans.&quot;<br /><br /><br />This should be an easy decision...Bernie 2020!!I feel bad for Bernie. His speech impediment has never slowed him down though. Way to overcome!The only man that can truly change AmericaFolks, please register and vote for this man. The only nightmare more terrifying than 4 more years of trump, is 4 years of Joe Biden.ohhhhh shit usa gon wake up after this...drop dat fire Bernie burn em!!I don&#39;t want free Healthcare, I want to continue to pay $650 a month for my shit💪💪💪💪well, fuck bernie sanders, this motherfucker thinks lula is a good guy and should go free. you defend a man against his proven crimes you become as much of a criminal in my book.What do gun shows have to do with mass shootings? It&#39;s unrelated.hey look it&#39;s the guy who&#39;s never had a real jobDude his idea on student loan is crazy af and sounds stupid as sh!t $2.5 trillion over 10 years. You’d have to pull $250 billion out of military spending for that. <br /><br />We need to just cut all this crazy spending.BERNIEJoe should have anonymous on for #1337I am a hardcore anti-socialist and I am going to watch every second of this video.  <br /><br />Thankyou for this contentCmon joe! Couldn’t light up a blunt like you did with Elon??I remember why I liked Bernie!Fuck off with this socialist propagandist.

Ted Cruz &amp; AOC are already proposing bills to combat lobbyists influence, everyone just needs to support it to help solve that issue! You can&#39;t raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, all that does is benefit the huge businesses who can afford the wages and then inflates the prices to the end consumer so it becomes irrelevant!Personally I would love to see Bernie or Tulsi win.  But I also like aspects of Trump.  Mostly I’m against the corporate control of the media and our political system - which each of these three can combat.  Cheers mates. ✌️I just can&#39;t even listen to this punck<b>Ok, this is epic.</b>When no one has a gun you dont need one 2 protect yourself either you fucking muppet have a look western europe and fuck hunters 2 leave the planet the way it shoud be!!Didn&#39;t he have to cut everyone&#39;s hours after raising his own employees minimum wage netting them less money? This guy is nuts and his policies are horrible &quot;but the rich are rich&quot;  seems to be a justifiable argument to the idiots that support him.I love how he mentions all these big corporate entities, but he fails to mention big tech and the problems they&#39;re facing (you know with censorship and all).... Oh wait that&#39;s rightBernie has been in politics for what 30 years?  and hasn&#39;t done shit.Crazy Bernie lolOld crusty liarJust imagine.. a fucking joe rogan podcast with AOC 😂😂😂😵I think one alternative is not to have a debate format at all, that is for high school students.  <br />All candidates should receive questions well in advance and then be interviewed individually for the critical issues based on sample polling by the American people (online and offline). the candidates should be given a much longer time to respond, beyond 45 seconds, especially for critical issues related to the economy/budget.  The candidates should be required to submit a written plan based on their position, with timelines, for the areas/items they want to change.  If they want status quo for an issue, then they should just state that up front and be done with it.I know that there are smears over Sanders because of his title, but I rarely, if ever, run into legitimate arguments against his policy proposals.Fuck Bernie, fuck Socialism, fuck insane (D) Party mantras and platforms. <br /><br />DOWNVOTED!Universal health care COULD NEVER WORK<br /><br />...unless you live in:<br /><br />Australia<br />Austria<br />Belgium<br />Canada<br />Chile<br />Czech Republic<br />Denmark<br />Finland<br />France<br />Germany<br />Greece<br />Hungary<br />Iceland<br />Israel<br />Italy<br />Japan<br />Netherlands<br />New Zealand<br />Norway<br />Poland<br />Portugal<br />S Korea<br />Spain<br />Sweden<br />Switzerland<br />Turkey<br />UKBernie’s only mention of any historical precedent is to promote and bolster socialist events: Lyndon Johnson and medicare; labor; and workers rights.

He&#39;s consistent with his opinions, very few politicians like that (Ron Paul is another good example).If he didn&#39;t  want to ban semi autos I would consider supporting himAs an outsider looking in (I&#39;m Canadian) this man makes a ton of sense. Get your shit figured out America.Yang or Bernie 🤔🤔Americans and their senior citizens running for president. Ideal presidential candidate age should be 35-55, there&#39;s a reason people retire in their 60s. You wouldn&#39;t expect an 80 year old to do a good job in any other field.A jew carpinter who wants to fight the powerfull and help the poor - where have I seen this before 🤔?Pharma had the media trying to scare Canadian&#39;s about Bernie&#39;s trip for insulin in Windsor. If Americans kept coming they&#39;re going to create a shortage 😯 I call BS.<b>laughs in german about you filthy animals hating the best thing that could possibly happen to you as a society</b> how insane do you have to be to not want to live a healthy and financially stable life?Okay, Canadain healthcare is the end all be all of healthcare. But let me say this specifically. I have a form of chronic daily headache called New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH). I have to be treated by a headache specialist, of which there are only about 500 in the U.S. This is not a normal neurologist, in fact normal neurologists just aren&#39;t aware of how to treat someone like me. They say it&#39;s a migraine, give me nine pills that last four and a half days for a headache that is severe 24/7. And those pills don&#39;t work anyway. So, anyway, I sought out my headache specialist. It took about six weeks to get an appointment. As mentioned there&#39;s very few of them so they are hard to get into.<br /><br />One of the people in my headache group is from Canada and had a slightly different story. They said they sought out a headache specialist. It was going to be a two hour drive to get to the nearest one(I&#39;m fortunate that mine is about 10 minutes from my house). They got an appointment two years in the future. I want to state that again, there is a two year wait to see such a doctor in Canada. But with this disease you have to do what you have to do so this person made the appointment and waited in pain for two years to see the specialist. One week before the appointment the doctor&#39;s office called and said &quot;The doctor has reviewed your chart and cannot do anything to help you, we have canceled your appointment.&quot; <br /><br />Bernie, this is not good healthcare and we should not model our system after it. Is there a way to have good health care at a lower cost for all? I don&#39;t know, but Bernie sure doesn&#39;t know either because that&#39;s not his plan. His plan is to have worse and cheaper healthcare for all. I don&#39;t think we should say it isn&#39;t possible to have good and affordable healthcare. I think we just need to actually ask the questions of how do we do that? But again, that&#39;s not what Bernie is selling. <br /><br />Fact, Canada suffers from brain drain in the medical industry. What that means is that often some of the more educated people from a country with a lesser economic opportunity will migrate towards a country with greater economic opportunity. So, some of the specialist and other doctors move from Canada to the U.S. because they can make more money here. We don&#39;t want to end up in a situation where people are choosing not to be doctors because of reduced economic opportunity. We don&#39;t want those of the best and brightest going into non medical fields for that reason. As stated, there are already a shortage of specialist across many areas of medicine and Medicare for all will make that worse. I wish that weren&#39;t the case. In some perfect utopia everyone would be able to get in to see the doctors they need immediately, but we don&#39;t live in that utopia.<br /><br />Remember one thing. The current healthcare plan that the U.S. has and that the Democrats are complaining about is the healthcare plan that the Democrats developed and told us &quot;we&#39;d have to pass it in order to see what&#39;s in it.&quot; They knew they were full of shit then as they are now. The sole goal of the PPACA was to essentially screw the system up so much that it would force the country towards a single payer system that so many Americans don&#39;t want to be a part of. The Democrats were hoping so hard that the Republicans would be able to &quot;repeal and replace&quot; the PPACA before this election cycle so the Republicans could be blamed for continuing rising healthcare costs. But that didn&#39;t happen. The current state of healthcare is a product of Democrat legislation and only that.While my country was under the Soviet rule (meaning being tortured, raped, robbed, humiliated etc.) he actively praised USSR and had a party here :/that $4.5 billion (~<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=7m45s">7:45</a>) is just the tip of the iceberg.You can not buy a gun at a gun show without going through a background check...thanks for the meeting of a snakeWhat minute dmt questions?????That awkward moment when Bernie’s Campaign staff demanded $15/hr, and magical had to cut everyone’s hours in order to pay them $15. <br /><br />Health care is not a human rights, you don’t have a right to a doctors service for free. <br /><br />Canada’s flock to America to see specials because the waiting lines are so long...<br /><br />VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE: <br /><br />When the government spends other people’s money on other people neither the cost nor quality of healthcare matter...<br /><br />When you’re spending your own money on healthcare both cost and quality matter, government will always be a net negative when it gets involved.Dr Cornel West is a mastermindGet Keanu Reeves onLarry David is getting so good I thought it was Bernie!Ok Joe, I forgive you for everything.Trump should make Bernie Vice President. Add a twist to the political side show!They are just reality TV shows for soundbytes. Yeah fuck em I agreeFUCK YEAH BERNIEAll Area 51 secrets will be revealed under a Sanders presidency CONFIRMEDFuck this old man he is a piece of shit.It&#39;s amazing how many stupid people believe Bernie is actually some kind of Communist.Five minutes in and I&#39;m already triggered. Healthcare is not a right. You don&#39;t have a right to someone else&#39;s skills. Rights are something you are inherently born with. Speech, thought. The ability to decide to get up and go somewhere. Those are rights. Having someone else to do work for you because of your needs is not a right.Yuge news so happy to see this.Love Love LoveThankyou thankyou thank you Joe for having Bernie on! LOVE YOU! Love what you do for us!Bernie 2020!Feel like this is going to be #1 most viewed Rogan Podcast of all time. Calling it now.I want to like him but he just has no clue when it comes to economics, i.e. minimum wage. He completely overlooks what it’s going to do to small business owners, which make up the majority of minimum wage employers.Finally,  a platform Bernie can speak freely onLooks like George of Otto and George!Bernie!!!California has a pretty high minimum wage.It&#39;s not the guns its the white folks killing mass@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=12m03s">12:03</a> - Wealth inequality is real and is a problem, albeit a serious problem, but we can&#39;t truly understand wealth inequality in the US without acknowledging the role of interest rates.  &quot;When and if the system returns to a normalized interest rate environment, many metrics of inequality, namely those tied to net worth, will appear far less extreme when expressed as a multiple to median than they are presently&quot;  - Joshua Kennon.  Even though I disagree with Bernie on taxation and incentives, I always like to hear his thoughts in long-form because we want the same things, we just differ in how to accomplish them.Who the fuck is that guyNice Bernie.  That&#39;s how you bring Conservatives in.  It&#39;s not about the money, it&#39;s about the power. You work hard and earn lots of money, that&#39;s fine.  But if the amount of money allows you disgusting amounts of power, society will limit you... probably by pitchforks. This system is mucked.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=44m12s">44:12</a> &quot;we need above and beyond gun violence&quot;  no bernie, we already have thatHow many of his staffers are making less than $15 an hour?You have to have room temperature IQ to like this guyIt took burning about 15 minutes to convince me to vote for himI KNOW BECAUSE I WROTE THE DAMN BILL!Poor guy is clueless.

Then, instead of saying that he&#39;s not Maduro or that he doesn&#39;t love dictators, he pivots to another topic. Wow.I dont follow or like politics. But I like people.Trump next?My family has owned and run a candy store for over 50 years.  Majority of our employees are high school kids. My mom is so afraid of the minimum wage raising she&#39;s starting to take action towrds shutting down the business.  I am for the wage raise but for small ma and pa shops is hard...Should&#39;ve had Joey Diaz sit in on this one. He could&#39;ve gave bernie a star of death.20 years, this is Bernie best.  S. 885 (113th): A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 35 Park Street in Danville, Vermont, as the “Thaddeus Stevens Post Office”.

You&#39;re still blaming the hammer cause you missed the nail.if you want to know how scared the establishment and the corporate oligarcs are of bernie just look at the downvotes.DONATE to Bernie :)Not a fan of Barry so I won&#39;t be listening but good on Joe for having him on.Bernie GursBernie’s first conversation where he’s not yelling. This is great!Bernie these are radical ideas cause we need to pay for it. Just cause people like the idea and want it doesn&#39;t mean its not a radical idea. Most people would agree to free healthcare, free housing, free college, $15 minimum wage, etc. These things don&#39;t grow on trees. I mean you don&#39;t even pay your campaign staff $15 an hour. Lets get real here Bernie you have radical ideas that most people are too ignorant to understand the costs of implementing these ideas. So of course they support it. I like ya Bernie but you are not a feasible leader of the US and none of the Democrats besides maybe Tulsi and Yang are feasible US PresidentsMinus cost tailing killary and being anti guns I like bernWas this live? I didn’t get a notificationAlright Larry Elders next please I need a dose of common sense after thsuI honestly thought that with additional time Bernie would have an opportunity to expand on his ideas. This was basically 1 hour of Bernie dancing around questions and reciting his rehearsed talking points.No entiendo cómo, el Sr. Sanders, quiere que otros paguen un salario mínimo que él no puede pagar a sus trabajadores.Wow wow wow. Respect for bernie for coming on this episode. Never seen a candidate do that.I&#39;m personally not a fan of bernie but I&#39;m happy you had him on the show. I think you should invite more political figures to the show.Maybe tee up some more softballs? Hour long advertisement... Ever try to push back even just a little?Where was Jamie with the fact checking??? Bernie keeps making statements and says not to quote him or I don&#39;t know. Jamie comes in to confirm facts or statements with everyone else, I&#39;ve seen majority of his podcast, yet he doesn&#39;t come in to fact check him or at least attempt to prove the statements Bernie makes.The $15 minimum wage has cost people their jobs everywhere it&#39;s been implemented. Yet Bernie keeps pushing it.Bernie I literally talked to someone last night SandersSo if you&#39;ve been at a company for 10 years and worked your way up from minimum wage and are now making 20 buck an hr, the minimum wage gets raised to 15 and all that effort you put ion just went to shit. Your not getting a raise to 28 to make up for it.Ohhhh this comments section is going to be golden let me get my popcorn lolI emailed Bernie and asked him to help cover my dentist bills. I figured he&#39;d be very concerned and willing to help. But, I didn&#39;t get a cent. Who&#39;d have guessed he&#39;s actually a hypocrite who couldn&#39;t have cared less ¯\_(ツ)_/¯This candidate is a liar he loves Cuban and Venezuelan regimes, just really pay attention to what he promises!BERNIE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE 2nd AMENDMENT HE IS A LIAR! AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS NOT THERE FOR HUNTING!2 minutes in Joe defends Kamala Harris.  Toe Rogan to the end.Bernie &quot; I just talked to someone yesterday&quot; Sanderssellout rogan giving socialist scum a platform. rogaine has always been a 2 faced fuckDo rightwingers not realise that Sanders is anti globalism??? Thought they&#39;d like that about him honestly.This guy is an absolute cancer to our country and a huge hypocrite.  What’s good enough for me is not good enough for we.  He can suck it and I wouldn’t mind if he choked.Legalized itMe too drugs are a real thing, that is why there haven&#39;t been any new developments in anti-psychotics/depressants since SSRI&#39;s (1987)Joe needs to have RYAN DAWSON on!!!<b>Bernie &quot;Dylan Roof Should Be Allowed To Vote From Death Row&quot; Sanders 2020</b>Drink some water....Bernie: “In 1960’s college was virtually free. States and federal government started cutting back on higher education and put more burden on the student to pay for tuition so that’s why tuition is very expensive now.”<br /><br />Can I get a fact check on this?The DNC is trying to fuck Bernie over again like they did last year because he isn&#39;t a corpratist stooge like the rest of them, except Tulsi. All these dislikes coming in are from the DNC trying to downplay Bernie&#39;s success and vision for what the American people truly want and need. The dems want another puppet in the White House to keep the status quo of war and empire. Disgusting.WoahHELL YEA!!!!Media and these candidates need to get off the “assault weapons” kick. It’s a term that’s misguided and misinformed. Ar-15 is a semi-auto rifle. That’s it. Ask why billions of dollars spent on privacy invasion and domestic surveillance programs haven’t worked on catching these idiots?  ask questions like that instead of broad-stoke demonizing law abiding gun owners.It boggles my mind that Americans dont fight for the right to ban guns, this country is so behind the times compared to the rest of the world.I want to stick my yang in Tulsi Gabbard&#39;s private sector and in her loop hole.The truth is that the people who have a hate on for Bernie will give a thumbs down and talk shit without listening to what he has to say. They can’t make a legitimate argument against him, only regurgitate the BS talking points that have been drilled in to their hollow brains.AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!Like Canada , pull out 15% taxes for all states on products and services to all Americans and have a free health system.I don&#39;t agree with Bernie but o can easily say he&#39;s the only one who can face TrumpMedicare isn&#39;t terribly popular as comrade Bernie likes to claim.  A Gallup poll for this year put people who are satisfied with Medicare at under 50%.  And it&#39;s stayed within 3-4 points of that since 2001.  Government heathcare isn&#39;t good.fuck yes!!So there were never any mass shooting before Trump  Was into office?Why is the podcast shorter than usual? Did Bernie Sanders croak?You fail for not having peter schill on to debate him.  He would have gave the old man a heart attackI just threw up in my mouth in the first 10 seconds of thisSo many great talking points, lost me at banning semi-automatic rifles...This guy running for president of Canada?I bet trump will come on when it’s closer to the electionOn the topic of poor mental health, Bernie keeps saying &quot;for whatever reason...&quot;  The point is he is running for President, he should know what the reasons are that America has such a bad rep on mental health.  Maybe Bernie show be shown this video and make sure as many people that need an understanding of what is causing bad mental health should watch it also...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVQ4LIp39Xo&amp;t=26s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVQ4LIp39Xo&amp;t=26s</a>To all of you people saying its so nice to hear a politicians point of view, try reading a news article sometime instead of just listening to video clips. You can get plenty of context to understand what their agendas are.No, I shouldn&#39;t be punished for the very, very few who do horrific things in society.You finally got on the old guy who hates moneyBe Careful...Joe Rogan&quot; U dont wanna have creepy Joe Biden on ur podcast&#39; he might wanna grab you shoulders and massage U...😂I was here at 50k subs back in Giorgio tsukalos days, this channel  has blown up so much almost 6 mil that&#39;s nutsWhat the funkEverybody is too stuck on this left vs right paradigm. Its more complex than a single linear axis. While i dont agree with some of what Bernie says.. He does have some good points and i like the fact hes the longest serving independent.Reading your comments. ( not like he does !! No wonder !!  You lot. ...( majority of comment makers )(who are most passionate American law abiding as in a long past it’s sell date amendments!! ). How can you still go by a amendment that’s dates back to a war that your only protection was to arm yourself against the redcoats. !!  Ffs. Stats were released yesterday. 272 odd killedthis year in mass shootings with your guns that are only allowed because of the protection against English forces all them years ago   !I. YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN ATTACKED ..EVER !!!   Survive a blitz like our grandparents did . Then argue the case !!He sounds like he is actually intelligent, but how could you possibly think that $15 minimum wage just blanket it on to the whole United States could ever work?<b>Daily Reminder:</b><br />Canceling student debt is not only viable but its implementation would have a net growth for the country and the working class. Most of the people detracting from this policy proposal are boomers who paid their debt and want to see no positive systemic change for future Americans or even their GRANDCHILDREN. It&#39;s spiteful and dumb.  Its literally no different than saying, &quot; I paid for decades of indentured servitude, so its only fair if you should too!&quot;. The billionaire class and wall street also push this propaganda onto the populace. Student debt can deter you from future ambitions, starting a business, moving, marriage, children, buying a home, and the list goes on and on. Don&#39;t be a brainwashed useful idiot for the billionaire class and establishment. Bernie 2020 &lt;3Mad respect to Joe Rogan for having Bernie Sanders on 😀👍 Wish it was longer tho I love Bernie Sanders &amp; Hearing him speak, he is rock solid &amp; true to his word.

Come on Joe Rogan I cant sit through this much of Eor himself, happiness old and dumb Bernie SandersBeyond lame.Got 20 minutes in and had to stop, he can’t even give a straight forward answer. Never noticed how his voice sounds like his mouth is full of orange juice before.“The corporations sit there in their corporation buildings and act all corporationey. And that’s how they make money”I&#39;m a Bernie fan but by no means think he is infallible by any means, however the strength he holds in his convictions truly is awe inspiringBoring milquetoast rehash of the same old Bernie boilerplate. He did nothing to earn back any of the support he lost by bending over for Hillary or with &quot;White people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot; (that includes me), and less than nothing to win any new support. Had to scrub through it because the rerun of the rerun of the rerun was boring.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23IWROTETHEDAMNBILL">#IWROTETHEDAMNBILL</a>!Why do you care about illegal immigrants more than black &amp; white americans?Bernie everything is free SandersWow, Joe get him high a talk to him about Joseph Stalin, tell him hiw he started as a socialist democrate, and then went on to kill tens to hundredsnof millions of his citizens, tell him how Venezuela invested all the PEOPLES MONEY in oil and bankrupted the country.Bernie stole Andrew Yang’s criticism of the debates within the first 30 seconds.

Spare meFor the love God have the great white hope on hereLooks like Rogan has a lil herpes action goin on in this video on his top and bottom lip he&#39;s trying to hide with stubble.It&#39;s been crazy watching this alien-conspiracy-laden fleshlight-sponsored psychadelic MMA podcast turn into a cultural tour de force over the years. Love every bit of it. I think it&#39;s a positive force.Let the dislikes immediately after upload, the joke and rude ass alt right comments, and the straight up disingenuous interpretation of a podcast the commentor didn&#39;t even listen to entirely speak for themselves. There&#39;s a lot of good stuff here that should be more than agreeable. Let&#39;s not let it get muddied by these assholes who want nothing more than to create doubt and dissent on our social media platforms. Watch and listen for yourself. Enjoy what this is for what it is and try to take something productive from it even if you disagree at face value.Good on you Joe for bringing on Bernie. This guy is the real deal and he needs all the help he can get considering all the corporate smearing that&#39;s going on.The guests Joe manages to secure never ceases to amaze me. Big up the JRESo all insurance companies and all pharmaceutical companies banded together to pay for an ad against Medicare for all that was ran during your debate? And Joe doesn’t call out these wacky conspiracy theories or ask about evidence?i always have a problem with a communist who tries to hide behind populism while enriching himself off the backs of taxpayers. the very kind of pooplitician who should be drawn and quartered.Joe Rogan should be president of the USA. Seeing Trump as president still seems unreal. But better him then Hillary. And surely better Trump then that creep Biden or this old man. Is it really that hard to get something better?Bernie: You can&#39;t trust politicians but you can trust me.What state can you buy guns at a gun show without a background check?Get Ben Shapiro and Bernie on togetherHow do you dislike more than once ?

Feel the Bern, baby!private citizens should be able to own &quot;assault weapons&quot;.Politicians are using fear of mass shootings expand laws that support tyranny like what we did with the patriot act post 9/11Bernie must be sitting pretty high up to be looking down at Joe while talking 😂😂😂They only stay in the US cuz of the no taxes. U charge them taxes then they move to mexico or China or anywhereI lean libertarian. I think Bernie is the candidate that says what he really means though. I don&#39;t agree with the gun control ideas but he seems like a good man. Whomever got him to be on this is a genius!What a crazy fuckFIIIINNNAAAAALLLYYY!!!Yang2020Joe Rogan for president 2024gotta Get Dr.Cornel West and Mr Bernie in the same place<br />all this whilst Joe Rogan Lights a NuggetBernie &quot;lobbyists control our government and allow big Pharma and other big corporations to run freely so we need more government control&quot; SandersWoah just woahMarshall did a great job behind the camera today!A TRUE PATRIOT BERNIE SANDERSget Dana to help you have Trump on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BreakTheInternet">#BreakTheInternet</a>HOW DARE YOU BITCH ABOUT MILLIONAIRES...

They operate EXACTLY like a pistol. You pull the trigger and one bullet comes out. There are no options to make more than one bullet come out per trigger pull.Living in Scotland where we have a majority of what Bernie is advocating already in place (free healthcare, free university education , free prescription drugs) , I can tell you it&#39;s pretty fucking awesome.I read the communist manifesto today and this guy is right out of the playbook; down with the rich, and power to the workers. You vote for this guy you are voting for a communistQuestions Joe might ask if he ever knew what he was talking about:<br /><br /><br /><br />Bernie, why did you cut your employees hours after you started paying them 15 an hour? How will you prevent employers from doing exactly what you did? Or deal with inflation after you increase the minimum wage? Why would anyone go to college if they can go get a low skill job and earn a livable wage without graduating high school? How will anyone be able to start businesses if they can&#39;t afford to pay workers the high wages you demand? Why would they for that matter? If you tax the highest income earners so much do you think they might leave the USA or stop working so hard? Do you know what an incentive based economy is? Did you ever read &quot;Basic economics&quot; by Thomas Sowell, since you were mailed so many copies? If not you should, because it does not seem like you know what corporate tax or property taxes are. When you say &quot;Assault weapons&quot; do you just mean &quot;Scary guns&quot;? Do you know what &quot;...shall not be infringed upon&quot; means? Are you aware the assault weapons ban that was passed in 1994 did not reduce gun related homicides? Are you aware that most gun related homicides are committed with handguns? Are you aware that over 90% of mass shooting are committed in gun free zones? Do you know the average police response time to a call? Do you have armed security at your events? Why would you be opposed to armed security at schools? Do you believe the people have a right to defend their own lives themselves? Do you know what the wait times are for surgeries in countries with medicare for all?THIS MAN GOT MY VOTE.Bernie has never read a ATF form 4473.....Price gouging exists when they use emergencies to increase prices dramatically. What could be a bigger emergency than life or death medication and operations? They are practicing price gouging with no laws to stop them from profiting off of terror.Next is trump, make it happen Joe, great work.Holy moly Sanders on JRE<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m30s">0:30</a> in and Bernie quotes @AndrewYang ! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>Omfg wowwI was voting for Bernie Sanders before this.Joe didn&#39;t press him on anything. Not suprising at all.I agree with Medicaid and I&#39;m Republican just my humble opinionJoe, you should have trump on your show....Oh godBernie, warned us and was correct about gay marriage, iraq war, bank bailouts, welfare for the rich and climate change decades before everyone else. A true to life Jon SnowBernie really doesn&#39;t want to look at JoeThere goes Joe inviting more of those alt right guests again. Never gives time to the left. When will he stop being alt right adjacent??Bernie for president. 20/20Joe Rogan is going to be team Bernie when this is overSanders is still pulling his punches with the Democratic Party.  That debate design is done on purpose specifically to hurt people like Sanders.What&#39;s the odds on Trump coming on the show?Joe, now you MUST bring Marianne Williamsson!!!!! This was awesome. Thank you for this episode &lt;3wtf is thisTits 2020.Finally, a Rogan podcast I can watch with my leftist gfGrand Solar Minimum is the only weather change,going to be colder next 30 years.Get joe rogan on the podcastI’ll vote for him just for the free healthcare 🤷🏼‍♂️Anyway........the amount requested...would be the absolute destruction of the dollar...    thoughtsCan someone who disagrees with Bernie on his major proposals articulate exactly why his plans will not work? Try to avoid using the word communist so as to give away your own ignorance.College prices started going up because the government guaranteed loans!!!!  Follow the logic! Government interference while often well meaning, create unintended consequences.Bernie on the next debate:<br />&quot;DMT IS A HUMAN RIGHT.&quot;Commie bastard!I have always admired and appreciated how honest and genuine Bernie is. He has been fighting for ordinary people by fighting corruption his entire life, with a record compareable to few, if any, in modern American politics.GIMME FREE SHIT!!!!Bernie Saunders the left wing socialist millionaire, makes senseHe wants to legalise marijuana with an executive order... I know who Joe’s voting for 😂 <br />Edit: well this escalated quickly lmaoI bet bernieinmypeehole sanders got sucked off by jamieI really wish Joe would have had him define what he believes the 2nd amendment is.Get TRUMP on joeok.  i am on board.  but i want a tax on stupid.  you do stupid things that cost the rest of us money,  you go to a work camp. at said work camp there is no healthcare, no nothing.  right now we have a reverse tax on stupid.  the rest of us pay for what the stupid people do to themselves, each other and the rest of us.Bernie and his vocal fry.....sheeshThe predominant conservative perspective is that the 2nd amendment is not about hunter&#39;s rights; it&#39;s about providing the people a means to defend against a tyrannical government. I also know Joe knows that is the conservative perspective, yet he didn&#39;t ask the question. This was reminiscent of the Jack Dorsey interview. Very weak.How do you think&#39;s going to pay for all this s*** it&#39;s going to be the taxpayersIm in the middle of both parties and honestly could care less for either but Bernie, where are you getting all of this money to pay for everything for everyone. You sound like a socialist communist. America was built on capitalism. That is why we are as great as we are. You are trying to break the foundation of our nation. You will absolutely no get my vote.I don’t like Bernie’s politics but I respect anyone who will come on to Rogans show for a long form discussion about their viewsThumbs up=I will vote for Bernie in 2020<br />(For our own human analytics)It’s interesting that he can’t look joe in the eyeShould have asked why he caved to the dnc an crooked Hillary and gave support knowing he was robbed of the nominationJP would not approve of Bernie&#39;s posture <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23toplobster">#toplobster</a>Im from the UK dont even know who this guy is but his idea of health care sounds like something that is essential in the USA. Makes me feel very fortunate to have the NHSBernie doesn&#39;t know that lockdown drills have existed for like 20 yearsGet the president on next.Boom ........................BEERRRRRNNNNNIIIEEEEE!!!!Idk shit about politics but this dude has my vote. He seems like he genuinely cares which is more than I can say for most politicians I seeAlex Jones has entered the chatBernieeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!Trump 2020!Joe &quot;what would you done&quot; RoganIf we are going to give healthcare to everyone for free then medical school should be free as well.I didn’t watch this admittedly. Why the fuck would you have this communist fuckwit on your show?, blows my fucken mind.Wow Bernie actually came on here I&#39;m surprised<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23joerogan2020">#joerogan2020</a>Joe coming with the softballs again. Disgusting.Free healthcare doesn’t work anywhere as efficient as our current system. Longer waiting times and at least 37% increase in taxes isn’t exactly going to make people happy and healthy.Amazing! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieTulsi2020">#BernieTulsi2020</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EndTheWars">#EndTheWars</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MedicareForAll">#MedicareForAll</a>In the Uk we have  massive problem with American Drug companies cozying up to various politicians in parliament, they want to destroy the health system in the Uk so they can force in the same system that you suffer with in the United states, it is all about the money, they will have British people dying in the streets and dying in pain, just for money,  they are EVIL. pure evil...In the same sentence he says child daycare is unaffordable to working parents and that we pay child daycare workers slave wages....okay?? How do you fix that, listen for a whole hour, didn&#39;t hear any solutionsWow! This is awsome. I support trump but I&#39;ve always wanted Bernie to explain his policy.What&#39;s a magic lance?Bernie is so full of shit. Typical Marxist. And I swear, it should be mandatory for every single person that wants to be a politician to have a minor in economics.His first answer to the first question.For the sake of honesty, on the whole 270 mass shootings a year thing, the vast majority of those are committed with pistols and 4+ people shot in one incident is what qualifies for a mass shooting. It&#39;s only the high profile ones committed with rifles that make headlines. Murders by semi auto rifles hardly register on a pie chart compared to pistols, and nobody wants to take those... yet. Maybe banning &quot;Assault weapons&quot; would stop mass shootings committed with &quot;Assault weapons&quot; but we need to have some perspective.Could you imagine the current presidents replays to the questions posed to him!As a type 1 diabetic, that &quot;any price they want to, any day they want to&quot; hits too close to home. I cannot state the amount of times I&#39;ve set aside money by multiplying my prescriptions cost times the number of months in a year and not come anywhere close to having enough to meet my actual expenditure. Some of my rx change price on a monthly basis, sometimes for the better, mostly for the worse.Wut?WhaaaaaWhat are the odds we see Trump on here?The argument for raising minimum wage is flawed. <br />If the minimum wage is raised to $15 an hour to better the lowest earners in the country, business owners will raise prices to offset the cost or automate jobs.<br />The people who are earning $15 an hour now, doing slightly better than the minimum wage ppl will the just earn &quot;minimum wage&quot;... their economic value goes down to match minimum wage earner. making the &quot;minimum wage&quot; earners nothing more that a larger number of people. lowering the overall purchasing power for most and moving people just getting by at a slightly high wage than minimum back to &quot;minimum earners&quot;...Trump 2020ehBernie seems like a politician who really wants to help. Hoping he gets the Democratic nomination.3,000+ dislikes in less than an hour after the video drops... just further proof that no body listens.Horrible and scary policies. If this man was able to put all these into action America would crumble and fall into a dictatorship and this the greatest social experiment ever tried of people governing themselves without the goverment in control of their lives would end. Trump 2020Sorry bud, 2A. Shall Not Be Infringed.. pretty simple.The thing I like about Bernie, the man truly believes in his ideas and convictions, and does not waver. The other thing, He has a good heart..NOW ON THE OTHER HAND, im already taxed enough, and I work on a farm, and these Pseudo Bourgeois claiming they are for the Workers, and never worked a day in their privileged life.. you think you are poor, go to India, Brazil, Honduras, Haiti and tell me how poor you really are..&quot;Joe it is legal because they make the laws&quot; dammnnnThis was like one of those Larry King infomercials with teed up questionsI wonder if JR is gonna watch his languageHoly shit holy shitttttI am so happy to be seeing this!!! First Tulsi, then Yang, now Bernie, if you have on Elizabeth Warren he will have on every person I would be willing to vote for!fake and gayBERNIE &quot;FRIGGIN&quot; SANDERS?!!! This is unprecedented.He sounds like he really cares, but he&#39;s confusing many facts, and gives the same vague solutions, to putting more money to work in hopes of results, in the same manner as we&#39;ve tried in the past. I see Andrew Yang as the modern day, Bernie Sanders with concrete solutions, and ideas to change incentives, which in term changes behavior.Kamala had no intention of responding wtf are you talking about?Joe is weak and stupid.<br /><br />He refused to ask Bernie why he hasn&#39;t implemented any of these policies in Vermont.So nice to live in a country run by a completely trustworthy cartel. I meant government excuse me.trump 2020Forcing to make businesses pay 15$ hr is legitimately going to destroy small businesses financially. Big corporations will cut jobs. Small businesses will hire less employees. Anyone who has ever owned a business would know this. Raising to 15$ is infantile logic and will ruin business. Why not focus on restoring the value of the dollar. Make that 12 worth something.Joe Rogan is the GOAT!<br /><br />B. Sanders is a wack job of a human being!Bernie defining assault weapon 😂fuck sandersFeel the burn🔥🔥<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m41s">34:41</a> All I heard during the podcast.FOX, CNN and MSNBC receive millions in advertising from Big Oil, Big Pharma and Weapons Manufacturers. Bernie Sanders is fighting Big Oil, Big Pharma and Weapons Manufacturers on behalf of the American public. Upton Sinclair- “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”As much as I disagree with this man, I can respect him for coming on programs like this and Fox.fuck yeah boiiiiiiii!!!!Hopefully this enlightens people on how smart and wise Bernie is :)Ideas with zero ACTUAL solutions.. I wanted to be open minded and hear what he had to say and after an hour I didnt really hear anything...<br />Edit: I&#39;m at work listening so I&#39;ve been in and out admittedly and yes there were a few points I can agree.He should start a small business and try paying everyone 15 an hour 😆 in idahoWhen you provide subprime loans (people whom are unlikely to be able to repay the loan) bad stuff happens. If you increase the demand by providing said loans prices will soar, same thing that happened with the housing boom. The answer is not free education.😦😯😍Great podcast. Thanks Joe!I’ve never heard Bernie talk. Seriously have only heard him yell &amp; wave his hands.The US is controlled by the NRA and drug companies among others, they&#39;ll never let the states have a NHS or gun bans. Which is unfortunately why Bernie wont win. <br />Their influence is silent but huge.<br />I wish we had someone like Bernie in the UK instead of the current bafoonGo out and research for yourself inflation compared with implementation of minimum wage laws.I&#39;d like to see all of the candidates on Rogan, one at a time.Its gonna be exciting to see the fact checking videos following this<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m50s">2:50</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23HESNUTS">#HESNUTS</a>WTF happened to Joe? He used to be a good interviewer.I find it hilarious that he talks about raising minimum wage to 15 and hour but he refuses to pay his campaign staff 15Lol what is thisHe literally just said he wants to take all the wealth and power.WhooaaIt would be so awesome for Trump to do JREOk, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=31m25s">31:25</a> in Bernie tells us an anecdote about &quot;this guy I talked to&quot; who was in his 50&#39;s and still paying off his college debt because he was going NOWHERE, and worried about getting his SS checks garnished. Well, why on earth was he in his 50&#39;s going nowhere with a college degree? Was his major the study of screwdrivers or something? Was that degree subsidized by the gov and part of what allowed college admins to bump their salaries astronomically? Why would he be on SS at 50 years old?<br />The BS they continually spout makes the entire thing almost not worth watching. <br />I do appreciate having the candidates on for a more personal session, but they can&#39;t stop the BS.WtfYes!!!! Everyone Gets a a free car!!!!! Vote blue plz!!!!!!!!!!!!This is a sickly old man! Like Hans moleman!Great problems, but not the best solutions. Andrew Yang has the best. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yang2020">#Yang2020</a>The pharmaceutical companies develop their drugs with grants GIVEN to them by the National Institutes of Health.  Then once the drug is invented, the drug companies get to keep all the profits.  They don&#39;t even have to pay back the money we gave them.    They use free money given to them.  Drug companies are greedy freeloaders that get to make up the rules because they own all our politicians and judges.  This isn&#39;t democratic.  Then they use scare tactics to misinform and talk people out of free health care.  It is time for everyone to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance industry.  They are slowly redistributing the wealth of this country from the working people and into the hands and bank accounts of the ultra-wealthy and powerful.Wow, 5 minutes in and he is a fool. His ideas are radical.  You can&#39;t just pass M4A and not expect major changes to the system. Who will handle those changes?  <br /><br /><br />Bernie&#39;s platform is this<br /><br /><br />1. There are &quot;problems&quot; (even though they are arguably not problems)<br /><br /><br />2. The ideas are simple (when in reality they are complex)<br /><br /><br />3. If you disagree with them you are ignorant, a bigot or corrupt<br /><br /><br />When that is your base you have no room to progress.  Bernie is dangerous.I like this joe. Good post! Bernie all day!bernie&#39;s a stale meme , he&#39;s incapable of producing anything new.You know, as a non American, I admit I know close to Jack shit about most candidates, so I might as well ask here, why do so many people hate on Harris? Does AOC has an actual chance and is this a good thing?I’m not a fan of Bernie so this may be biased.,,, but he can’t even look Joe in the eye??Drexel T. Bupkeens. He pulls out of Indigo Frak Razorback pullers in Quebec is stronger than either of these bums lol. He&#39;s gonna win next year guaranteed.Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Full of shit. They want to disarm the population to control them fully without opposition or fear of opposition.Whaaaaaaaaat the fuuuuuckBuncha right wingers in these comments patting themselves on the dick for being so open-minded and virtuous for listening to this episode -- unlike &quot;The L e f t&quot; who are so closed-minded. How cringeworthy.If Bernie wants the black vote he should change his first name to ColonelUniversal healthcare sounds nice on paper but it is not sufficient in a capitalist system. Hiking taxes, overwhelmed hospitals where many individuals need major treatments or surgeries are waitlisted. This is nothing new, we experienced this with Obamacare and is currently a major issue in Canada. You buy healthcare you get what you pay for it’s a more concrete system. However that being said, I do believe patents on medicine should be better regulated by our government and not scaled by companies looking for huge profits.We&#39;re overprescribing because of the for profit system.Good luck trying to shut down Rockefellers Big Pharma,should have been tried at nuremberg trials for the gasses they made for the concentration camps and the medical experiments by Joseph Mengele.Bernie is the Democrats TrumpIncome inequality is not real!  Anyone who would argue that doesn’t understand how capitalism works! Sorry but true!FREE STUFFI fucking love all the tears from the comments, keep em coming folksHmmm I wonder if Joe will ask Bernie why he sold out and endorsed Killary. 1 shill to another. OR why Bernie is a gun grabber....doubt it. he only lasted 1 hour.....lolzThere will be a war .Tulsi, Bernie and yang the only real mofos out there right nowLol 😅Bernie 2020!!I cant waste an hr of my life on a guy who NEVER HAD AN ACTUAL 40 HR A WEEK JOB TILL BE BECAME MAYOR ....and became a Multi millionaire OFF OF CAPATIALISM ..AND KEPT IT !!!..Is he still pitching Nonsense from his 3 mansions and 200,00$ AudiWould if Bernie admitted that the whole world was a big bungalow that is being tented by evil power hungry bats?And here I thought I couldn&#39;t be more of a JRE fan... <br />THANK YOU JOE!3K plus dislikes from racist pieces of s*** 😂<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=17m20s">17:20</a> bro you&#39;re an honorary millennial ❤️✊🏾Joe Rogan for president!Bernie Sanders is a full-blown retard on the gun issue. Total communist assclown<b>Lots of pandering on this one.</b>What I learned from this is that America is corrupt. If few people are allowed to use their money to impact millions of lives, the system is corrupt. <br />- Thoughts from a young Dane enjoying lifeI sympathize with the want to expand Medicare, however I believe that it would be a misguided step. Expanding medicare will blow out spending even more and it doesnt treat the root of the problem witch is crony corruption and patent holding. If you take away the patent protections then it upends the market and forces prices lower by allowing more small businesses to make our drugs.He dodges so many questions. I can’t see him being a better president than trump. I see him tanking this country. So glad joe brought him on tho, I love learning about the leftAnything that&#39;s a f*<b>***</b> handout is bad for the United States.<br />Think of it logically<br />You got so many people pulling the wagon if everybody jumps in the wagon nobody&#39;s pulling then you ain&#39;t going nowhere<br />People need to be taught to earn their keep in this worldLooks like Bernie jumped on the yang and tulsi bandwagon aBernie &quot;Im not gonna look at Joe while im talking because im a dishonest commie bastard&quot; SandersHandguns are used mostly in &quot;mass shootings&quot; and theres no such t1hinf as assult weapons.Damn joe getting everyone on here nowBernie is like a nice old grandpa. He smart, well spoken, but his politics are just not for me.Bernie ? Fucking sanders ?Andrew Yang thoHave trump onI dropped what I was doing when I saw the guest lmaoCommunist. Hate the guy.Make that man PRESIDENT123k views in 45 minutes wow!Why bernie and not donny trumpI just clicked on this show just to say I’m officially never watching this tool again.HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZINGOnly way I’m watching is if they blaze up.Bernie &quot;I have 3 mansions&quot; SandersIf we need more education ( College or Tech) why don&#39;t we just teach this stuff in highschool?I dont really care who&#39;s the next president is..<br /> As long as it&#39;s not that orange shit faceJoe is an amazing interviewerBernie talking about min wage when he’s under suit for not giving his own team that is hilarious <br /><br />He thinks he’s not radical but when you would RADICALLY change the govt and economy what else should it be calledFuck this guyI agree with a lot of what Bernie says. Except the gun issue. Guns are a symptom. If you remove guns from ISIS,do you think they&#39;ll disband? Do you think the ideology goes out with the gun? How about removing needles from heroin addicts? Think they&#39;ll clean up? Or will they just change their method?  You&#39;ll stop some things. You&#39;ll also cause more things. You&#39;ll cause a lot of people to fall into another ideology and wage war on the government and people. Fix the disease, not the symptoms. Heavy gun control is literally putting a band aid on a severed limb. It&#39;s a non starter. It&#39;s an emotional response in the wrong direction. It&#39;s literally today&#39;s prohibition.Thanks Joe and Bernie for doing this. Great podcast! Solidarity from the UK, hope this guy is your next presidentWhat what whaatNZ also has the same political broadcast rules as Bernie described. You cannot buy more than a certain amount of advertising. All donations are capped. The Govt pays a proportion of your votes for ads. They strictly limit the time for campaigning.Needed Tim Pool there for some of that real pressure*Heres your Big Mac and shake sir, that will be $15.99 <br /><br />These fucking idiots don&#39;t understand basic economics. We&#39;ve already seen what happens in the cities that have raised it, prices went up and people lost their jobs. The cost will absolutely be passed onto the customer, period.He is very wrong about the canadian health care system...he is cherry pickingMy two man crushes in one room. Love this.He says that medical bills are to expensive. An RN gets paid $20 to $30 an hour. If you pay a McDonald&#39;s burger flipper $15 an hour to do something that took two hours of training what are you going to pay an RN, $80 an hour??? Wouldn&#39;t that make medical bills even more expensive? I don&#39;t believe this guy. Sorry.licensing guns is unconstitutional extortion. We shouldn&#39;t have to pay for the right to protect ourselves from criminals and tyrannyWhy would anyone actually give this crazy old communist/socialist hypocrite any consideration as a president is irrefutable evidence the walking dead is a reality show .Fuck this socialist cocksucka!!LMAOWYF WHY ONLY AN HOUR???Lol people still scared of socialism like we are not living in a capitalist system.I would love to see one of these with Bernie and Ben Shapiro. Just having a conversation.I guess we’d have to wait till after the electionsWhen you asked Bernie about the $15 minimum wage why didn&#39;t you ask him about why he didn&#39;t give his own campaign staff a $15 minimum wage until they went on strike just recently????  How much can he support the $15 minimum wage if he wouldn&#39;t even pay his own people it until it stared to hurt his campaign.Feel the Bern!!!  Bernie for President in 2020! The best and only choice,  his only problem is he makes too much sense!I could listen to Bernie Sanders all day because he’s talking about what this country actually needs.WTF????????????????????????  LOL.  Ridiculous.WHATJoe you really disappointed me with this you didn&#39;t even question him on anything.Watch your wallet, Joe!Ok now can we get Steve Bannon onHe didn’t even smoke with him smh wasted potentialNow let&#39;s hear all the lefties who called Joe a nazi and a gateway to the alt right sing his praises now lol. This podcast is the heart of diologue right now. From Ben Shapiro to Bernie Sanders, bring it all on.Shoutout Windsor O.N! 🇨🇦🇨🇦This dude is such a liar. He claims that we should take money from the rich yet this dude is LOADED. Multiple homes. Cardi B loves him but he wants to steal everything she earns. Also, Canada&#39;s healthcare is absolute shit!I helped with aged care ratio rally fair treatment for staff nurses rights although I&#39;m not in a union prefer not to beretarded old.jew fuckJoe is asking all the right questions. Bernie is giving all the right answers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=51m44s">51:44</a>You can&#39;t garnish social security payments.Im Republican but I respect Bernie for this.You don’t have to take it out of your wallet after care because it’s already taken out each paycheck you, boob!What Canadians don’t pay in healthcare they make up for it in parking tickets3 minutes in and grandpa giveaway is already saying how something should be free. 3 minutes! LMAOFinally joe !!!!Dude... wtf bernie! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m15s">24:15</a>jre viewers cant handle anyone with liberal leanings being on lmaoooOh by the way not one question on immigration joe smoke more weed fuck head.Giving white nationalists, like Bernie sanders, a platform is a bad bad idea. SHAME! SHAME!! SHAME!!!<b>DMT FOR ALL</b>Ordinarily I wouldn&#39;t listen to this guy for a minute. But I&#39;m going to give this a chance since he can explain in detail what his ideas and views are.To give all the candidates a place to give there ideas on a particulate subject, the democratic party and others should make a website where all the candidates makes a video of 20-30 mins on a given subject. For example healthcare, they could all have there vision explain tough fully in one single place where everyone could go look for it if they are interested in it.  t\Then there could be many subjects where the candidates would be explaining there thoughts. Instead of using news to try to get the information where sometimes it&#39;s not showed correctly or at all. I think it could help pass on the right information to lots of people interested in the politics. <br /><br />Also Good job Joe!I can say I listened to Bernie talk for 7 minutes, but I can&#39;t listen to anymore of this man who is misinformed.My problem with Bernie is that he has never worked a real job in his life. He went straight from academia to politics. <br /><br />So giving away money is cool for him to do.Get John Delaney on here.Booooooo-ernieThe country is showing all the bad choices that have been made and will continue if are representatives remain as unrepresented of the people...

I had hope for this interview, but he <b>really</b> sold me on not voting for him. His ideas are terrible. I&#39;m so disappointed he dodged answering most direct questions.Fun fact 95% of mass shootings weren&#39;t done with assault rifles it was pistols and shotguns domt talk about shit u dont know about bernie that&#39;s how u lose votes lmaoshould i say more?Love this manYou might aswell Decriminalize <br />marijuanaDamn Joe changing the future of the countryCORPORATIONS, DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT: PLEASE MOVE ASIDE AND LET THIS MAN BECOME PRESIDENT IN 2020.No immigration?God I fucking love this old manBernie fucking sanders .....Looks like the Russian bots are thumbs downing the crap out of this podcast..Jesus Christ, Joe, you keep surprising us with your guests. Next week you&#39;ll have Putin on. 😂Fuck BernieBernie 2020Gun laws should be similar to Australia only single shootersthank god for youtube and joe,kyle,pacman,and jimmy dore. otherwise id still be stuck in the loop of network propagandaNo mames. After brother Cornel West, El Bernie. Loving it.The line up for the next shows:<br />Vladimir Putin <br />Kim Jung-un<br />Michael Phelps <br />Tom Cruise <br />Le’Veon Bell<br />Bill Belichick<br />Darth Vader 😂Strive to be the 1% . Even if you dont get there you&#39;ll be successful enough not to care about the percentageWow dis nigga oldI don&#39;t like bernie or his policies, but i&#39;m liking this <i>video</i> because we need to hear people out like this.He’ll never see the Oval OfficeJoe my guy good one 😅Fixing health care, I’m willing to you hear you out, but you can’t have it with a borderless society.  Gotta choose one or the other.  How do we afford it when we hit 60%+ of the population not paying taxes and having 5+ kids???Bernie Sanders, the hypocrite himself.Tulsi was already here Bernie. You&#39;re late.I clicked on this ready to dislike the video but if u disagree with anything this guy said on this podcast then your a ignorant peice of shit there&#39;s nothing wrong with anything he said exept maybe no assault rifles even though his approach seems pretty fair and sensible other than that everything he said sounded like what this country needsWhy Bernie no smonk da weed ? CYKAI watched this hoping I would have a change of mind... But this guy is a wingnut.Bernie Sanders 2020 :DSocialism is great!   NOT!Bernie !!!!!!This is a surprise .. okayI appreciate this interview with Bernie. I am glad he didn&#39;t down President Trump. I do agree with him about all the drugs being given to the school age kids. The teachers don&#39;t want to deal with over zealous kids, so they want them on harmful drugs.Want to know why student loans arent susceptible to Bankruptcy? Because assholes would declare bankruptcy the day after they graduate as a loophole. Hell, in this country there&#39;s so many social welfare programs that you will probably come out ahead if you could nullify your debt, get section 8 housing and food stamps for a few years, then get back &quot;on your feet&quot; compared to a kid busting their ass saving and paying off loans for 10 years after graduationI’ve dreamed of this podcast happeningOh godBernie is a clueless old fool that has never accomplished anything in his entire political career.welp, i made it 25 minutes, but i gotta tap out. i hate it when people give nothing but softball questions to people who are running for president.my problem with this is Bernie&#39;s lack of eye contact when talking to Joe. SnakeishFor anyone who hasn&#39;t been in high school for 15 years, he&#39;s right about the school drills... every month we practice school shooter situations, along with fire alarms we have police alarms, and so far at my high school weve had 2 bomb threats where we had to evacuate the school, we have to also wait for confirmation of a fire if fire alarms go off incase there is a shooter trying to draw us out. Fear of being shot at school is a real rational fear for most students in my high school in Alabama.Omg i love him so much uwuBernie sanders now does the DMTShould&#39;ve had Joey Diaz on with him.Assault weapons?? Like an assualt hammer or knife. Oh the left ia fucking insane. <br />Do you people really buy this idiots bullshitBernie Sanders is the real lizard King of the desertBernie sanders knows what’s good!Bernie Sanders is an American hero. People over profits.Joe asks good questions but not the real questions he only questions statements softball can joe ask him basic life questions giving this guy an open door to say anything he wants with little to non push backBernie &quot;bread lines area good thing&quot; Sanders50% of Americans don&#39;t go bankrupt because of medical bills. they go bankrupt and HAPPEN TO HAVE medical bills. such a crock of sh17 candidate.<br /><br />I&#39;ve donated 2 turds!! match me, and he&#39;ll give them to the establishment AGAIN!!<br /><br />TRUMP 2020!!🍊👌If u want socialism or communism go to Cuba or Russia, don’t turn America into a shit hole when there are already plenty around the worldLmfao think I&#39;ll pass on the communism I like money and to see individuals progressing the human race instead of retarding literallyI’m going to try to listen without expectations. But fuck Bernie.Im falling asleepI’m interested in less than one half of one percent of what Bernie has to sayThis is a interesting chess move by Bernie Sanders. Now every other candidate will try to step and repeat this process but it won&#39;t have as much impact as this interview will.Joe rogans i.q. dropped having to carry  on a conversation with this dumb-o-crap.$15/hr has not gone over well in OntarioAlright... let’s get Ron Paul on.. then Rand Paul..Damn this is a short one.He belongs in Andrew Yang&#39;s Presidential Cabinet... Yang2020Not a bernie guy but I can still admit this is pretty badass. Stuck at work so can only watch a few min. Hopeful bernie gives real insight into what goes into a modern day presidential campaign.(Spoiler alert) Joe Rogan does an entire interview with Bernie Sanders and doesn&#39;t challenge him once, tell me im wrong...Loved Bernie before he started pandering to identity politicsSurprised he didn’t have a stroke.👿hows onit doing is it a profitable companyHe seems like a nice guy, but i still believe he&#39;s a socialist, just like Nazis didnt call themselves socialist (even though they were nationalist socialists) so is Bernie, I&#39;m not calling him a Nazi but he&#39;s a socialist no matter whatThe madman got itWas open to what he had to say but now im DEF not going to vote for him<b>ONE HOUR?</b> 🤔Feel the bernFuck you joe for having this commie piece of shit on here.<br /><br />Sell out socialist you Are HOE RoganHow can you refute these fantastic ideas. Like actually watch this and tell me.Joe should be Bernie&#39;s vice presidentHealthcare is certainly privilege....  change my mind! 😂That&#39;s my presidentYour not supposed to support a family working at McDonald’sWhere&#39;s the confrontation on how the cost of everything will go up if the minimum wage goes up, and how Bernie said white people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor, or how he wants to give illegal immigrants the same rights as legal citizens, or even how he says he&#39;s for the 15 dollar an hour minimum wage yet doesn&#39;t pay his own staff that, and is now subject to a labour complaint because of it.<a href="https://youtu.be/k9oyDTR0EwQ">https://youtu.be/k9oyDTR0EwQ</a>Com&#39;on Jon Zero push back? Wtf?This podcast is probably Joe&#39;s most important one ever done. Doesn&#39;t matter if people watch his MMA podcasts or the other ones. Today the whole world is watching this because it can literally change USA in the near future.Progressives, like the video! The right will dislike the video without even listening to it. The revolution is real. BERN DOWN THE ESTABLISHNENT!Canadian healthcare is so good, when my parents go to Yuma Arizona they run into hoards of Canadians crossing into Los Algodones Mexico to get dental and medical care, and buy prescriptions..&quot; I have no intention of paying that minimum wage to my employees &quot;<br />Bernie sandersNow you should get Hillary onI&#39;ve been waiting for this. It finally happened!Medicare For All eliminates the private taxes that the insurance companies call premiums.<br /><br />Medicare For All will give American businesses more freedom.<br /><br />Medicare For All will grant American workers more economic freedom, and more freedom to pursue their goals and start new businesses.The GOAT... <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />BERNIE SANDERS 🕊Bernie isn&#39;t far left, hes rational. So sick of the stubborn douchebags of America who completely ignore that the rest of the modern world exists.Wish this was hours longerI’m no Bernie fan, but he’s the only candidate that’s seems like a genuine person. At least he’s honest about the stuff he wants to do.The bulk of, if not all cost for research and development of drugs are funded by taxpayers. They are done at university research labs...Look it up folks, Standford and MIT(same for others) are not so private when it comes to funding...MIT was funded 100% by taxpayers and went down to 70% recently, and Standford is 80%. The excuse for ripping you off for sky-high price was a lie.I can&#39;t support anyone who supports the inherent bigotry of socialism or intersectionalism.Think Joe just got Sanders elected. LolThe question is Mr Sanders who is going to pay for it? Certainly the government&#39;s not going to pay for itTHIS RIGHT HERE IS WHAT WE FUCKING NEED. CONVERSATIONS THAT LAST LONGER THAN 2 MINUTES. I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE LIKE BERNIE SANDERS A LITTLE MORE CLEAR NOW.So Bernie, have you tried DMT?No freakin wayBernie Sanders will unite us against the class warfare being waged by the upper class on the middle class and the lower economic class. Warren Buffett- &#39;There&#39;s class warfare, all right, but it&#39;s my class, the rich class, that&#39;s making war, and we&#39;re winning.&#39;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m56s">5:56</a> don’t you lose your healthcare in Canada if you do heroine and other heavy drugs? Not trying to sabotage Bernie Sanders’ argument. Just something I’m unsure aboutWhy is he talking to the desk?So Bernie is Alt Right now??????Finally!!!! 😃😃😃Remember Bernie was kicked out of a hippy community for being too lazy. Bernie demands $15 per hour, but pays his employees $10. Bernie pushes socialism because he is rich and powerful.Did Bernie inhale or nah?I waited 1 hour and 7 minutes for shirtless Alex jones to kick the door in and it never happened. DislikeBut are you going to have a conservative on?@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m50s">24:50</a>, when the edibles kick in after telling everyone at the party they were weak af...Why restructure pharmaceutical companies but create new taxes for all to pay to cover student debt and continue to allow colleges to make billions of dollars a year ?  Why not restructure colleges as well ?  Why is it ok to tax all of us and allow colleges to continue to operate, spend and charge recklessly all wile generating billions of dollars in revenue.  I believe the answer is a political one, but I appreciate Joe Rogan  and do not want to turn the comments into a firestorm.Man bernie looks oldDetailed explanation of tax rate hike to afford Medicare for All, Free College, etc. <br />The gov. handouts can&#39;t be a serious pitch. <br />America is great because of Capitalism.<br /><br /> Mess with that and these 2 millionaires wouldn&#39;t be talking right now.....This is just the pendulum swing to get Trump onAnyone who passed 7th grade math knows Bernies plans are impossible without absolutely destroying your income in taxes. Trust me you don&#39;t really want to pay for free healthcare for all illegals. If you think you do, you have never held a job. Much like Bernie who only passed 7 legislations in his 90 year old career.Bernie can only do an hour and you want this man as your president?I just disliked and moved on. FUCK YOU AND YOUR BREAD LINES BERNIE!!Trump, if you are listening, please call Joe Rogan and get on his podcast.&quot;It is LEGAL because THEY make the laws.&quot; - Bernie laying down the truth about who runs this country.So glad to finally see Bernie on the podcastBunch of assholes downvoting.  Fuck you people.OMG Bernie on Joe, hell yeah!!!!!Y u make me h8 u Joe?What. The fuck.Also the gun show comment is a myth u just lost my vote by not knowing what tf ur talking about fuck bernieI&#39;ve always thought that you should try to earn at least half your age in wage after the age of 18.blaming mass shootings on mental health is a stupid talking point u cant tell people not to have mental health problems but you can regulate gunsAgain with the fucking raising minimum wages. Let&#39;s just draw an extra zero at the end of every bill, coin, and check and call it a dayBernie Sanders = Vladimir LeninMy question is what do you do with highly productive people. They will outpace, out produce, work more hours, sacrifice more hours of their lives which translate to dollors in pursuit of a goal. If you take the reward  away, you will lose the participation of these people. Socialist are idiots. If you steal my income, you steal the time it took to make that income and therefore have stolen time from my life. That is unexcetible.Holy fuckI don&#39;t understand the complaint over student debt, they knew how much College costs before they went.I hope you&#39;ll have Don Junior in next to balance things out.People fact check this bafoonwow 3 presidential candidates that’s great , we can see and hear if they are full of shitI went to college and worked. I didn&#39;t take out a student loan. Boom. No debt. How stupid are you all?My back hurts watching this.Balanced Budget or BustTulsi n Bernie on Rogan. Those should be the DNC’s choices coming up1.4k dislikers must be brainless Trump sycophants. Fucking idiotsI clicked so fast...I thought it was Larry DavidBernie, cruz 55mph for 1 hour north and all will be solved 🤣Bernie Sanders is a thot. He&#39;s a freaking nasty hoe. He looks GOOD. I&#39;d love Bernie to bust my pussy open and tell me about Medicare for All. If a guy shows up with a Brooklyn accent and a copy of Our Revolution he can hit my back walls any fucking time of day dude. If a guy&#39;s like &quot;Just three men own as much wealth as the lowest 50% of Americans&quot; I&#39;m like &quot;take a rifle to the back of my head like Rosa Luxemburg&quot;Surprisingly, Bernie doesn&#39;t speak to the details very well.  I already knew he didn&#39;t understand economics, but now I&#39;m seeing he&#39;s all passion and no plan.LBJ was a fucking scumbag...this socialist shithead is out of his goddamn mind!Holy shit Joe, you&#39;re the real deal. I&#39;m sorry for doubting you.Wow great podcast!The level of Empathy this man possesses, hasn&#39;t been seen since Jesus! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FeelTheBern">#FeelTheBern</a>All the free healthcare stuff sounds fine and dandy, but there is a reason that world leaders come to the US when they need major surgery. The private system gives Dr.’s the incentive to create new breakthroughs. If you make the system public less people will want to become Dr.s cause they will be government employees and the quality of care will go down.Boo this man... 👻Bernie/Tulsi is a winning ticket. Bernie has the progressive base and young people and Tulsi appeals to some right wingers and independents Bernie himself cannot appeal to. Establishment minded Democratic voters will vote for anyone who is the nominee because all they care about is beating Trump.Banning &quot;assault weapons&quot; weapons will do nothingAre you sure it&#39;s not Larry David??Please ask him what is wrong with ObamacareBernie has one of those sticky white things that stretch in the corner of his mouth!Wow I didn&#39;t expect this, I&#39;m hyped, let&#39;s see how it goes. Very short, wonder if that&#39;s a bad sign.I&#39;m kinda glad Bernie went on Rogan&#39;s podcast. Rather than the Rubin report. Otherwise this would have been an hour and a half of Bernie talking about the intricacies of introducing national health care to a whole divided nation, whilst the blank faced Dave interrupting every few seconds to say the left overreacts on college campuses. To a very befuddled Bernie, wishing he only had 45 seconds.I mean....holy shitHe sounds so reasonable if you give him time to speak...Bernie “I talked to this guy/girl” SandersThis is going be better than Elon Musk,  get him to smoke a blunt Joe!5 minutes in and i can already  tell He&#39;s an idiotLook at these fucking cuckservatives trying to downvote lmao y&#39;all getting healthcare whether you like it or not chudsBut guys more government is the solution too government nuk nuk nukThey’re gonna wack this guy. He body slammed pharmaceuticals and it’s gonna go viral.I wonder what Bernie would look like if he was ever fully hyrdratedJust One More Law and We Will Have UTOPIA .....I see reptiles. They dont know they&#39;re reptiles.Trump2020Scumbag Bernie cares more about illegal immigrants than American citizens.This is SO awesome!!! I&#39;m so glad you had Bernie on!Fuck yeah!!!!!  FinallyIf healthcare&#39;s a human rite, what about the first and 2nd amendment. What about privacy, what about not being a government slave. How about being able to live without the government using propaganda on us to cause division and steal more power from usGlad joe rogan has people from all walks of life on his show and gives everyone a voice...with that being said Bernies politics are horrible and unrealisticDid not answer the minimum wage question at all. RidiculousJoe Rogan has Bernie on oh my gawd lolGet an interview with tech n9ne. It would be interesting to say the leastThere is no one on earth that would turn down a Joe Rogan interview.But guys more government is the solution too government nuk nuk nukJoe please get Ben Shapiro on to refute all this nonsense. I love Joe but he doesn’t have the economic understanding to challenge the points Bernie is makingSomething so inspiration about a man who never worked for anything who has everything and gives nothing who wants to take from the working to give to the useless...sooo beautifulI hope he goes over why he wasn&#39;t able to pay his campaign people that esteemed $15/hr &quot;living wage&quot;I’m pretty sure minimum wage is $10 in most statesFirst words to come out of his mouth are stolen from candidate Andrew Yang&#39;s opinion in he feels about the debate.Looks like Bernie is alt right adjacent!Happy to see Bernie on here--I&#39;m not a Bernie fan per se, but am more than willing to listen to what he has to say and actually consider it. Would be nice to get more candid and personal stuff like this from all the candidates, including our President.Bernie sucks balls. That is allQuoting Yang on the reality TV of debatesTHE BERN MAN!!💥💥🔥If you&#39;re too tan in the sand...Bernie SandersBernie “you got it” Sanders.I&#39;ve thought and said this many times, we are due for a civil war. We the 96% of Americans need to join together and destroy the tyrannic companies and the bastards running them.This is a brand is strong joe flexing on all pods at one time. Wow! Trump next weekCould you be nicer? No hard questions on his hypocrisy??? And Joe says he’s not a liberal???<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>Socialist piece of shitBend the knee bernie is a joke of a candidate but so are the other 30 of themJust kill the comments now honestlyomg Joe Rogan has Bernie Sanders on his podcast? WTF sort of alternate dimension do I live in? I don&#39;t agree with most of Bernie Sander&#39;s positions, but I&#39;ll still enjoy listening to this for the next hour.Hell yes Joe. Thank you for this. People need to listen to this man.National health care sounds great but this whole &quot;medicare for all&quot; is stupid we cannot give illegals free sh*t! But I&#39;d don&#39;t trust Bernie he&#39;s a snake and a con man.why does joe always ask people to bring the mic up to their face? Jamie is an audio engineer for fuck sake, he never heard of a compressor?Bernie’s Campaign Slogan: Vote for me, I&#39;ll steal for you!Raising minimum wage for entry level positions incentivizes retention by employers--something that is seriously lacking due to revolving door policies. I started paying taxes at 15 and took on the responsibility of starting a family with a woman who already had a six month old child at 18, so she wouldn&#39;t have to grow up in a single parent household, like I did. I had a great work ethic but no well paying job would give me the time of day, even with a diploma and some college under my belt that I saved and paid for up front, with no debt (but no credit either).Bernie Sanders is a thot. He&#39;s a freaking nasty hoe. He looks GOOD. I&#39;d love Bernie to bust my pussy open and tell me about Medicare for All. If a guy shows up with a Brooklyn accent and a copy of Our Revolution he can hit my back walls any fucking time of day dude. If a guy&#39;s like &quot;Just three men own as much wealth as the lowest 50% of Americans&quot; I&#39;m like &quot;take a rifle to the back of my head like Rosa Luxemburg&quot;So take the power to make decisions in this country away from the people and give it to the government! You really think they&#39;ll make better decisions?BERNIE 2020 BERNIE 2024 The only chance for the middle class !!!I wanted to go to sleep, but my jaw dropped when I saw this :))Canadians come here for health care!!I’m voting for Charles Palatine!Mexico will pay for the healthcare, don&#39;t worryIf our healthcare is so bad how do we have the best hospitals and specialists in the world and why do people from places with single payer healthcare that can afford to buy private insurance buy it and come here for major surgeriesJoe “it’s one of those things...” RoganYES JOE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! U THE MANThis guys a fucking idiotTried to give Bernie a chance on this but so fast he lost me. Immediately he thinks private companies should be forced by legislation to pay for him and his cronies to lie to us for an extended period of time. His whole look on life is someone else should pay for everything and I will force them to.WHAT THE FUCKI was going to give Bernie a chance but you know what<br />Kick rocks<br />Trump 20/20BoringJoe never challenged one thing he said. patheticBernie, “were going to raise the minimum wage.” Ask him how that worked out for his campaign team lmfaoThis has been a long time in the making... I share the same views as Joe politically... And im far from right winged... Good move on both, calling that this video hits over 2 million views in less then 24 hours now... Lets see a Sanders / Warren Warren/Sanders ticket for 2020..  Then let&#39;s see how our fearless Twitter finger Potus &quot;fixes&quot; our country..<br /><br />POTUS should be more Affraid of his fellow Senator seats that will be potentially lost.. If the Democrats win the Senate and strengthen the congress.. He will wish he loses.Assault weapon lmaoLol the first thing he proposes in the entire video is to have the govt force us to watch a candidate talk about nothing! Smdh lolHe makes some good points but turning the whole thing over to the government just isn’t a solution. Does the VA work well? Medicare is due for bankruptcy that’s math not politics.Has the internet broken yet?You cant stop mass shooting just like you cant stop drug users. Its up to the person and who they are. Some people are just broken.I agree with him about taxing wallstreet crooks to pay for educationThis comment section is full of hundreds of brainwashed lower and middle class Americans that have been conned into transferring their wealth to billionaires. Corporate tyranny is every bit as real as government tyranny. Wake the fuck upOy veyOh the sheer amount of triggered double digit IQsDoes Joe have the herpes?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=15m50s">15:50</a>if you couldn&#39;t get your ideas passed on Congress in 2 decades, why do you think you can now do it in 4? lol<br /><br />the crockpot, Bernout, is full of $<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%231t">#1t</a> and it&#39;s steaming. <br /><br />TRUMP 2020!Ask him why it&#39;s ok for him to become a millionaire as civil servant... But a business owner should be taxed at an outrageous rate for providing an actual service to society.. you&#39;re a fool burny and you&#39;ve been stealing from Americans for far too long. Vermont should be ashamed of itself!!! How&#39;s your big ass house on the lake that Hillary bought you for walking away in 2016? Damn fool.<br /><br />Do us a favor and drive 51 miles towards Canada and don&#39;t turn around.Joe- When the candidates are whittled down- why not have two of them on at a time to debate on JRE?WHATT!!? YESSS!!Every presidential candidate should have to do a session on the joe rogan podcast.Bernie, you’re a nutjob... but, mad props for going on JRE!Both of you have no idea what youre talking about when it cokes to gunsCan we get trump on the podcast plz 😂its a shame Bernie is associated with  &quot;progressive&quot; left crowdSome one needs to inform Bernie that resources are finite...HOLLYYYYYYY WHAT?!?!?His head is falling off!the canadian health care narrative is false as is cannibis legalizationI love how he compares the top 1% ( musk, bezos, buffet, Kahn) to the bottom % ( Walmart cart fetchers,  Burger King patty flippers)what a Brilliant and honest Human being fighting for what´s Right.  Basic Human Rights <br />Health+Dental Care, Sight and Dignity.I was always turned away from bernie by his speaking style on stage because he is so loud and abrasive, but seeing him in this environment makes him seem more reasonable and personable. Definitely increased his chance of getting my vote.lobbyists, are basically people who bribe powerful people to get what they want, but if you walk up to a cop and try and bribe him thats illegal?...i dont get it, none of that makes any sense?...i&#39;m from Canada , and i&#39;m voting bernie..lol...USA listen to this man!!!Haha let&#39;s go my boy Joe Rogan has Bernie Sanders! The best podcast in the 🌍healthcare is a right, so are guns... if taxes are going to buy you medicine and a doctor... taxes should buy me a gun and ammo...Holy shit Joe u actually did it!!!!Humanity First <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>OH MY FUCKING GOD DAMN GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Who does he sound like? Besides sounding like Bernie sandersAmerica was the best country in the world in every way......until we gradually started going further and further leftTake a shot every time Bernie says “Free”Fuck this rat.   This is a capitalist county.  AMERICA, not Canada.   Take your ass to canada.   May the poor die.I’ll stick with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>Hope my coworker watch this so I can talk about it tomorrow2 pieces shit 1 worse than the other.....the problem is, your ideas pivot on human decency existing. like people at mcdonalds are only their because they havent been given a chance and not because they spend their time doing drugs and breaking the law. before you talk shit i worked there as a crew member then manager for quiet a few years before i realized it was a dead end job for a reason.Oh Bernie stop the lies... the cost of college is sky high because the government guarantees school loans. <br />Government involvement ruins everything&#39;Like&#39; if u remember &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#39;s&quot;<br /><br /><br />Vote if u want a sequelBernie is a bumbling foolHow don’t people like or agree with this man ?<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>I wasn&#39;t convinced of anything, as in, I don&#39;t feel that he said anything of educational value.NO FUCKING WAAAAYYYYY😲😲😲😲It was hard to hear the interview over the sound of Bernie&#39;s dick sliding in and out of Joe&#39;s throatGet used to saying President Sanders cuckservatards and Neolibs!!Holy shit. This is why you got to love Joe. Has all sides on his showPowerful throat clearancesTrump 2020!!Joe &quot;I change my opinions based on who I&#39;m interviewing&quot; Rogan<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m30s">4:30</a> in and joe is already calling people out who don’t want to support  socialism. GreatSocialism is too expensive the country is already in too much debt<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=27m00s">27:00</a> Bernie explains why the cost of education has gone up. &quot;State and Federal governments started cutting back on higher education and started putting the burden on the student.&quot;<br /><br />What a fucking twist. That&#39;s exactly the opposite of what happened. State and Federal government INCREASED subsidies on higher education and INCREASED federal loans, which is EXACTLY why universities started charging more. If you can maximize the profit, all the while knowing that the students will STILL come to your school EVEN IF THEY CAN&#39;T AFFORD it, and instead use ridiculous loans to pay,  why the hell wouldn&#39;t you? Those government subsidies completely eliminated competition among universities, which is why schools can get away with it. If that was done away with, schools would be forced to compete with each other with price as a factor and they would HAVE to drop the price in order to stay in business.Guarantee the lobbyists are mostly RepublicanBernie should handle certain things but I will not stand by and let his socialist ways determine the fait of our country in military affairs or power. Sorry bub. You sound like a senator not a president. Socialism has never worked in any country why would it ever work in Americathe whole plan to make min wage disgust me, does bernie realize that by raising the minimum wage to a livable wage will do nothing but hurt the elderly and disabled on social security. How would that happen, well when the minimum wage gets a bump up, inflation also goes up. So for instant, if say the min wage goes to 15 dollars nationwide, inflation will also go up that would cause rent, mortages, utilities, food to also go up.  So by raising the min wage, not only will it not fix anything, but make screw over the disabled and elderly which are on a fixed income. I would seriously love to talk to bernie and ask him what would he do for the elderly and disabled after you raise the min wage and make everything too expensive for us on disability or elderly. The thing to fix people that are other 21 on min wage jobs is to get them into colleges or trade schools so they can work in careers and get off min wage. Min wage was meant to be a wage for entry level jobs to teach people how to work, its not meant to be a livable wage.Holy shit. I&#39;m not even a fan of politicians but god damn, that&#39;s Bernie Sanders on JRE. Wow. What a year?If this guy fools ya, ya dumbwhat a spiteful and bitter old man.Bernie: You can&#39;t explain a plan with a 45 second sound bite.<br />Joe: Asks question<br />Bernie: 45 second sound bite👍👍🔥🔥🔥I think only 25% of the mass shooters are &quot;mentally ill&quot;. (Stay was on TV last night)To those making comments about high taxation, Please check the top U.S federal marginal income tax rates from 1948- 1980. (They were as high as 91%). Nobody ever pays the top rate because of deductions.Hope he dies soonNot paying taxes on income violates the non-aggression principle....anti-taxers, COME AT ME! &gt;:DWhos this old KFC lookin guyHe says from his 4th vacation homeBernie Son, seriously, the rich-poor divide increased due to Globalism.i dont support Bernie or the current Democrats AT ALL, but im liking this and sharing it because... COME ON.I don’t agree with Bernie on the 2nd but I like everything else if the Republicans don’t turn out a good person I’d vote for himOk you yanks.   Understand guns mean sod all over here in uk. We spend more on our poor nhs than you will ever understand.  If any of septics care or give a shit like we do with your USA .  Just spend 1 hour in OUR  A &amp; E   Or in fact stream bbc ambulance series’s or channel 4s 24hours in A And E.  Nuff f ing said !!!5 minutes in and I&#39;m waiting to hear thoughts on weed and DMTNot even gonna watch it just came to dislike for BernieBERNIE!!!!!!!Blaming problems on a corrupt political system means that the system is good and only corruption of that system is the problem. Maybe make laws (seeing as how you work in Congress) to stop the corruption, instead of declaring yourself a socialist Democrat or anything else that isn&#39;t a servant of our capitalist republic?U gotta be kidding me 🤣🤣Unsubbed...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Jk calm downFor somebody who believes in giving free shit he sure values his time only 1 hour<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=19m01s">19:01</a>  In Australia, for under-21&#39;s, min wages are scaled progressively lower for every year you go down in age.  <br />So a 16 yo high school student is on a much lower rate than an adult.<br />It&#39;s perfectly reasonable, and fixes the problem they&#39;re talking about.<br />It also encourages businesses like McDonalds to employ young people, so ALL the employees are kids!Bwahaha poor Bernie he thinks he stands a chance again. Poor sucker doesn&#39;t realize DNC gonna do the same thing to him with Biden that they did with Killery.I’m relatively early!<br />&amp; I’m British!No such thing as a free lunchIt is interesting to hear his point of view. Unfortunately I don&#39;t think many of these things he suggests will work.I loved the other old man muppet when did they split?Wat.I respect Bernie for coming onto the JRE however I cant get past this guys socialist agenda. Trump 2020, this will still be an entertaining video to watchLow resolution thinking Bernie.Obamacare was stealing money from people who had no health insurance. You paid money for nothing in exchange. It was around $1200.00 a year for nothing at all. The IRS just stole it from your return taxes. Yea I&#39;ll stick with Donald Trump for President.Trump supporters hate it when people call Trump a facist, but they will call Bernie a communist with no hesitation.Okay, I didn&#39;t start watching this yet. But I&#39;m going to start by saying I&#39;m either going to love or hate this podcast.In Canada, you go see a doctor at a walk in, wait about 2 hours ( 8-15 hours if you go into the emergency walk in at the local hospital)  and the doctor prescribes either T&#39;3s, or heavy strength antacid for most problems.   Ya, they take broken bones, and heart conditions more seriously, but the care is as minimal as possible and you get you could wait up to a year for surgery and or an MRI.  Ya pay for what you get. Just sayin.Look if Joe is gonna go out on the limb and listen to someone and give them the chance to explain how and why they feel the way they do isn’t the least we can do as listeners is do the same ?Nice work Joe! Thank you!Dope!!!! Wow Joe Rogan!A few good points by Bernie but generally he’s just wrong. There’s no such thing as an assault weapon. All fucking guns are designed to kill people you dipshit!How to fix gun control: <br /><br />1. Allow people who already own them to take free lessons and free license classes. <br />2. Give a tax to gun holders who pass concealed license classes. <br />3. Obviously don’t allow people to just walk in a gun show and gun a bunch of guns. (Common sense) just make a wait list to how many you can buy in a given time, depending on license. <br />4.stop charging people so much for weapon classes and license. <br />5. Reward those willing to care in a role to protect others (tax break)<br />6. Real background checks (what drugs are you on, crime sheet, associates) <br />7. Put a mandatory slow down on assault weapon buys for common people (unless licensed). <br /><br />The license is the main part, but make it free!! I think that makes sense right?In before 10M views 😅What about getting a Trade Bernie?Awesome interview Joe! BERNIE 2020!God bless him...there are repercussions, for his ideas.. there are repercussions for all decisions.. he has wonderful ideas... society is turning, period... mental health is keyIs good to see politicians doing long form discussions.Bernie stop glorifying other countries. We dont want to be them . ThanksHonestly as a libertarian/classical liberal. I think Bernie calls out the symptoms of our healthcare issues perfectly, but I think his solutions would exacerbate the issues not help them. <br /><br />On another note, I think these sorts of formats are far far superior to television debates. I think eventually we will see debates between candidates taking place online more as conversations like this than we do as television debates that are extremely formatted. It takes away all the roboticness and the posturing and let&#39;s you see these people more as genuine individuals. I am excited to see how this kind of format develops in my lifetime and I think it would do nothing but benefit our political process.Only take until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m58s">2:58</a> for Bernie to say the word “Free”rogan has gotta bring up how he was royally fucked by hillary and the DNCThumbs up for Bernie!! <br /><br /><br />Lets make this the most liked video in JRE!!! <br /><br /><br />From your Canadian neighbor :)Bernie giving FACTS (Charlie Heat Version)I’m a Republican and even I think this was a good politics, he hasn’t gotten the chance to explain thoughtsWe, our government provides the research funding for the drugs that big Pharma have. Then it is given for free to them, then they price gouge us.This was bound to happen, glad it didHoly shitFuck you Bernie you aren&#39;t taking our guns you motherfucker!Bernie didn&#39;t do this in 2016 because he didn&#39;t need to.From a non American make this guy president, he’s a genuine good human being which is what the world needs right nowI daydreamed about this happeningFree stuff for everyone yes!About fucking timeHow many examples do people need before they realize how stupid any form of socialism is you can’t find one example of it working and thousands of it not do your research before you spew your stupidity&quot; Keep it a fist from your mouth bro, a fist from your mouth &quot;Bernie Panders.Forcing a doctor to provide free services to anyone who walks in the door is not authoritarian?He&#39;s gonna miss his chance again...yall are gonna elect Trump again. Americans are so fucking stupid man. This guy wants universal healthcare and has a real solid plan to get it done, vote for him on that alone. HE CARES about your fucking health, and that American people get proper treatment. And yall want to keep Trump, why? At this point, his presidency has been a clown show. Only thing I like that he&#39;s done was revamp the GI bill, giving veterans who get out after 2013 they get the forever gi bill which does not have a time limit. Granted, I don&#39;t get that benifit as I got out before 2013, but I think it&#39;s cool vets are getting that now. Other than that, I don&#39;t give a shit about much else he&#39;s done, in fact he&#39;s be involved in some pretty heinous shit, all those Mexicans dying at the border in custody is pretty got damn horrible and the guy just doesn&#39;t give a shit. All this bullshit energy wasted on that stupid fucking wall. Bernie cares about healthcare, and Americans getting educated. Those 2 things are some of our biggest problems, we are sick as hell with horrible healthcare coverage, and we are dumb as fuck becuase we don&#39;t value education...granted our education system is fucked up, Bernie wants to fix that. Trump doesn&#39;t give af about any of that, you people still trying to vote for him in 2020 are fucking stupid, I&#39;m telling it like it is... if yall help to put him in there again you&#39;re dumb asf. I don&#39;t give af how likeable and funny he is to you, use your fucking brain for once.I don&#39;t agree with Sanders but, Joe,  you just step up your game!Why didnt you lit up a fat one JoeDO NOT VOTE FOR BERNIE.<br /><br /><br />we will end up with sketchy cheap workers as doctors! When you goto the doctor nowdays theres always professional and nice normal people.<br /><br /><br />IF bernie does this, we will get crackheads working in hospitals! DO NOT VOTE FOR BERNIEI wouldnt say the Majority of the American people agree with you. Just make your pitch and be honest. Facts facts facts. Im trying to give an honest shot.Screw Bernie ...trump2020Get Trump next!!Oh yeah I entirely forgot.

He knows Joe has a huge platform and he wants his voice to be heardIt would be unreal if Tulsi could get back on one more timeA universal health care insurance program like Medicare For All, saves money on administration, advertising and duplications.<br /><br />It also saves money by not having to paying foreign and domestic shareholders, and it cuts out the middle men.Heyy nowI’m Bernie Sanders I want all your money and guns I’m a socialist fuck that hasn’t accomplished shit In life and never had a real job and have multi million dollar homes and don’t even pay my own staff a living wage. Hypocrite demon.So happy to see the candidates making rounds and including JRE - joe this is a testament to the hard work you and your team put in, I salute you 👍keep it up ... oh and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a> 😂Get Sleepy Joe for you #30330 podcast!america please elect this guyThe profits corporation take in go to advancing research and funding new technology LOOK UP where innovation comes from throughout the world!!

His name is Bernie Sanders. He is the savior...of American Democracy.Respect to Bernie but.....<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>All complaints, no real solutions.

We are being gouged by pharma, and healthcare institutions on the regular. Either that or go full free market with healthcare, which is a risky game. Pretend capitalism/Corporate oligarchy is the worst of both worlds.Oh how i Love watching america hang itself...literally one of the worst places in the world (not the worst but definitely in the top few yet try to make out like it&#39;s the best)Raising minimum wage at Amazon...the most profitable company on earth is a lot different than raising it to 15 on regular small businesses.

Which is it Bernie?! Make up your mind, cause you labeled a man evil for having money that he willingly gave to pay for student debt.

Dude I can’t believe I actually like him. Soundbytes and biases have not done him justice over the years. All of us are suffering while the few prosper. We do need to come together and take our power back from corporations. I love capitalism, but there should be limits, especially on healthcare and Amazon should pay taxes. No one will be as wealthy as these ppl and I don’t think Bernie wants to redistribute us basic people’s money. I love that he came on here. He could make Gabbard or Yang VP and the other a member of Cabinet somehow. Dude UBI should come from drug companies lol. Nice ‘cast Joe RoganThe left talk but never give solutions. HOW BERNIE!!!! HOW BERNIE!!!A fuckin reality tv show! Fuckin a right, its a joke on us! Andrew, tulsi and now ole bernie burn?!

You can&#39;t have universal healthcare AND open borders. Look at the UK. Their NHS is almost bankrupt due mostly to the EU&#39;s policy of free movement.The DNC wont let him winNo, Bernie, you can’t buy guns at a gun show without a background check.Dam Bernie don&#39;t give a f about kidsBernie &quot;antifa&quot; SandersWhy is it so hard for Joe to speak in definitives when talking about bipartisan issues... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=10m40s">10:40</a> he can&#39;t even say definitively that lobbyists are disgusting, horrible people who use tons of money to influence legislation that will negatively effect US citizens and poor folks abroad. He can only present it as a general consensus while it&#39;s an irrefutable fact. Guess what Joe, your alt-right and alt-lite following isn&#39;t going to leave you if you say lobbyists are bad.Bernie is a true man of the people. He speaks on behalf of the poor and the working class. Even if you disagree with some of his opinions about how government should be run, you&#39;ve gotta respect that hes stuck to his guns and been a man of his word, always fighting for the same group of people, for his entire career. This guy is a lot of things but a waffler isnt one of emLook Joe in the eyes, when you talk Bernie, you commie coward.Get Alex Jones In there to debate BernieSanders/Yang 2020Trump next!I predict this is gonna have more views then the one with that Elon fellaBernie has aidsCan you imagine if this moronic fuck became president ? 😂 he would destroy this country.Glad to know ever since 1979 Department of Education was created, education in this country became so good that communism is on the raise again.Bernie 2020Get Donald trump on the showThis guy use to write porno stories, slept on peoples couches for most of his younger life and now lives off the tit of the government. He now owns 2 multi-million dollar homes and has a net worth of 2.5 million. The American dream i tell ya! <b>sarcasm</b>They make the laws???... you mean YOU make the laws Bernie and have for a very very long time.I think Joe and other podcasters are pioneering a new way of discussing politics. These televised debates SUCK. Like they said, you cannot explain or discuss America’s issues and come to a solution or at the very least an agreement with the limited time frame. Whatever side of a political compass you fall on, we need to have serious, civilized discussions if we want things to improve.You&#39;d think after 1300 episodes Joe would tell the guest before the show to keep the microphone a fist from their face...Fuck this commie fuck! All he wants to tax the fuck out of all of us period...…………………….Omg two of my favorite people in life.

You can politicise healthcare but by all international metric rankings we have better outcomes for the majority of health than the USA and spend way less.<br /><br />If you get a prescription, it’s $11 at the time of writing, regardless of what the drug is or the length of the script. Do you have epilepsy, diabetes or a long term chronic condition? Then it’ll often be free. <br /><br />America is the country that our man on the moon within a decade, I can see no reason at all that if you guys as a country put your collective will together, the situation can be sorted. Healthcare <b>is</b> a human right.🤡🌍Andrew yang 2020Everyone butthurt he’s on here,  should be butt hurt all candidates don’t go here to talk.Cant wipe out student debt in Bankruptcy ..but you could at one time.

Bernie talks a good game, but it&#39;s a pipe dream in today&#39;s society and I just can&#39;t trust someone that doesn&#39;t look you in the eyes when speaking about your intentions.How much money does it cost to launch a new drug! It takes years and tones money and testing. That&#39;s where the cost is. Other countries don&#39;t have the regulation on the developersCool guest regardless of your political position. That being said, there is a zero percent chance Bernie can make it in a primary. The American people by the poles disagree with his ideology’s. Plus people need to remember just because certain policy’s sound great at face value there are some seriously dangerous ramifications from some of the policy’s he’s wanting to implement.We need to get that panama stem cell therapy here in the States.

He is the only politician fighting this!standby for Bernie memesLmao an “assault weapon”Bernie is desperate, so he goes on JRE... He&#39;ll still never be president.Sadly the reality is America will reelect Trump and edge ever closer to the point of no return, assuming you&#39;ve not already passed it.Yang did it firstWhat is confusing is he says the government is corrupt. On the other hand we should give the government more power. <br />Spoiler- Bernie is apart of goverment what changes has he made? News flash the president can&#39;t make laws. The house does. He is apart of the group he needs to be to provide change. What has he done with his power as a senator? He just complains about how he needs more power.I hope everybody now knows who and what joe rogan is first Cornell west now bernie, two of the most radical full of shit communists on earth no hard questions no research behind this interview you got a guy in front of you been in Senate 28 years, here&#39;s one question bernie you where one of the senior senators in charge of the va administration why did so many vets die, Bernie what the fuck have you done for 28 years, Bernie do you have a family member on Medicare, if my mother didn&#39;t have supplemental insurance she would have died, Bernie why don&#39;t you just tell the truth your a communists and if you had more power you would be a tyrant and would have no problem stripping people of there constitutional rights, and you have no problem lying to young people, you are a leech,and Joe guns and the 2nd amendment is to protect us from tyrants like this guy and his communist cult, America is 6th in the world on mass shooting smoke another jiont rogan total lack of research I am glad you took your mask off joe now I now with out a doubt what you believe and who you really are, thanks for finally coming out the closetBernie Sanders is a fucking lunatic.Bernie will make DMT a basic human right if he&#39;s electedthis is like a big deal.He endorsed Hillary after he was her first coup victim. <br /><br />He wants to take the guns.<br /><br />He wouldn&#39;t willingly do what he wants does to us forcedly, pay a minimum wage.

Oh yeah, he’s a liar and a phony.Mr talking points only did an hr when tulsi and yang did 3i will never support a candidate that supports open borders , socialism, and abolishing the 2nd amendment .  <br /><br /><br />those are my three main concerns when it comes to voting , we need a safe nation that runs on capitalism and the right to defend ourselves and maintain freedom.He&#39;s been real for 40 years. 40 years!  <br />He makes sense.<br />I&#39;m voting for him. Not him.

He has no chance in a 20 person field of liberals.  No personality.  Fear, we are all going to die, selling fear, so many years in the Senate, other than verbal BS, what major changes did you lead.SCREW BERNIE YANG GANG 2020!!!Bernie? WtfWuttt? Whether you support Bernie or not this is quite the nod to Powerful JoeRogan just up&#39;ed the ante with this guest!!Oh snap! A genuine anti-american on the JRE! Exciting day.I haven’t even watched yet and I’m bored of this old fartNever clicked fasterThank you Joe for having Bernie on. I&#39;m one of the people who has given you a lot of shit for continuously giving such a big platform to the IDW so I&#39;m glad to see something like this. I still wish you&#39;d cut back on the IDW crowd. PS: Have Sam Seder on. PS2: Even better, have Sam Seder on with Dave Rubin or Steven Crowder.Healthcare, housing, and education are broken says Bernie. Does he realize all those markets are broken because of democratic policies???I can&#39;t believe this is happening, truly.He’s all blow no goLike him or not, this is an important conversation and there’s no better platform to have it on.SELL OUT BUMMaybe Bernie can point out where in the constitution healthcare is mentioned? What bernie misses is that the cost of healthcare has gone through the roof, starting right around 1965 when medicare was enacted and its gone through the roof ever since. Get rid of government involvement, get rid of insurance companies and when people have to pay out of pocket, healthcare will be affordable.<br /><br />Oh and remember under Bush when the prescription drug bill was passed? Profits went through the roof. Once again, the government gets involved, creates the problem and then says we need more government to solve the problem. Throw this communist out.Hey America, this would be a suitable president.Well, today Bernie had a long platform for talking about his agenda he really always had, and....Oh shit!!! Talk about ufc. Maybe he should go on Joey Diaz podcast and smokeSocialist scum95 % of comment is what we need conversation this is awesome..Joe gonna go solve world hunger nextDamn community guidelines I&#39;ll stay silent.Funny he keeps mentioning how we should be like Europe, when that is the reason we started the revolution...to get away from that dictatorship.Fuuuuuuckkkkkkk noooooo 😅The millionaire socialist Bernie Sanders who got setup to lose by the DNC and never said a word about it. He&#39;s a fraud .Wtfh manThat&#39;s right Bernie, we can never get people to willingly march off to the gulag if they have weapons.Look at all the conservacucks disliking this video because of the mere sight of Bernie. Get with the program you corporate bootlickers.political asmr.Bernie becoming president is a night mare and any of the others on the left..the right has problems as well but goddamn, I fear for America mana lot of trades in the market are taxed at least 15% just a fact more than a little percent.Bernie is big dumbGuess who helped finance the election of Obama?  The pharmaceutical companies, the health care industry!Bernie is the dumbest mother fucker in the world when he talks about &quot;The Market&quot; for any good or service and I mean any.I’m not against Bernie. Cool to see him on this platform. That said, Joe asked him “you’re president, so what do you do about healthcare?” and he listed 4 more problems that he wants to solve. He’s great at identifying what he wants to change, but can he do it? I’m not sure I buy that he’s going to incite a “political revolution.”Holy shit, I was not expecting this.Get trump on next !I think most Joe Rogan fans like Trump or Andrew Yang. Nobody else matters.Bernie mumbling in my ear is the asmr I never knew I needed. Also it&#39;s amazing to see Joe&#39;s platform transform into a platform for presidential candidates, legit geniuses, and fun people to speak on.At what minute does Joe suggest bernie to try DMT ?I lean to the right and voted for Trump but right now I’m going to challenge myself to start this podcast with an open, unbiased mind. I think as Americans we need to be able to have an open <br />dialogue no matter our views. Guess I should practice what I preach. Wish me luck!This fuckin sell out, pandering his bullshit again. Get that fund money &amp; scram!Two 1%ers just talking a little politicsIf you try to get a Blood test for std in Canada, it takes around 6 months to get it.1994 assault weapons ban Columbine happened during that time. the criminal element isn&#39;t affected by gun laws.You are not worried about the deficit BernieI&#39;m voting for you Bernie!Lmfaoooooo already 3,000 losers disliked. HAHAHA cry more retardsI’m independent, I lean a slightly more to the left but I like to listen to the Joe Rogan podcast cause he’s willing to listen and talk to everyone’s different point of view without trying to attack someone or be offended. He actually tries to have a conversation.This was the most boring and Joe Rogan podcast I&#39;ve ever heard.This guy lies like a rug😆love this guy, used to watch &#39;larry king live&#39; all the time.Holy shit the madman actually got bernie. H Y P EJamie deleting my comments.Fucking Joe! Keep em coming bro!There is no R after agenda. ThanksOh shit it&#39;s really happening.B. Sanders!!I’m very pro 2nd amendment but I’m not a fan of the private sale loophole.Get trump next!! 😂<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=18m00s">18:00</a>, this guy can&#39;t pay his own staff of &quot;skilled&quot; workers $15. An hour, but expects others too.anyone willing to sacrifice a bit of freedom deserves none of it :)Yes!45,000 Americans die each year because they do not have access to a health care system.Wooooooow! That was the only reaction i had when i saw the thumbnail. The JRE is sooo big nowadays. Awesome!Meh.My dreams come true!!! BERNIE ON JRE!<br /><br /><br />Fuck yes!!!Him saying I’m not “radical” doesn’t mean he’s not “Radical”These ideas are so radical!!!YEAH IN CANADA YOU CANT GET IN TO SEE A DOCTOR YOU DUMBSHIT!Bernie gon go into cardiac arrest lolIf bernie gets elected this time it is 100% from this 😂This was super refreshing.  I have to say my view of Bernie is definitely tiny bit more positive. I wasnt crazy about him but after hearing him here I see where he&#39;s coming from more clearlyAs if Joe just rolls into a podcast with Bernie as if it’s another day in the office. RespectI can&#39;t imagine Joe hawking the Fleshlight these days. :DThat man should have been president...Bernie Sanders asmrAmericans are so brainwashed by the billionaires that they will argue that they don&#39;t deserve free healthcareAndrew Yang 2020As much as I love hearing Bernie talk, I can&#39;t stop thinking about Bob Lazar and S4. That shit is so far beyond everything else. My brain won&#39;t let it go.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CrookedBern">#CrookedBern</a>Bernie lost my respect when the DNC/ Debbie Wasserman Schultz etc screwed him and the American Democratic process  in 2016.  Tulsi gabbard stepped down because she didnt want any part of that crap, good for Tulsi! And to hear Bernie now say the DNC wants to give all the candidates a fair shot?!?! Wtf lolGunshow loophole is a myth it just a buzz word to get the retards worked up. A gun show doesn&#39;t have to be present for these transactions to take place. If any politician mentions gunshow loophole you know they are full of shit and were to lazy to do the research which makes their opinion invalid. We live in the age of information so there is no excuse to be Ignorant.Hey Bernie, where does the &quot;white people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&quot; fit into all of this?Just because they work at McDonald&#39;s doesn&#39;t mean they earn minimum wage. I&#39;m a goldsmith with 9 years experience and I only make 13...When I first saw the title I thought it was a joke. Haha love it. Guess I&#39;ll go to sleep at 3am.I&#39;m upvoting because a god damn political candidate is talking at length, unedited, on YouTube instead of using the mainstream media.Get rid of colleges, and high school. Bring back trade schools and expand them into all fields. At the end of middle school, you can test into trade schools, and based on your aptitude, you will qualify for some or all trades based on your score.<br /><br />Or not, and you&#39;ll be a laborer. . . Still need forklift drivers, stockers, warehouse workers, garbage truck drivers, cashiers, ect.Free university? Like in Germany? Cool. Except that university degrees are becoming worthless. Only 45% of high school grads in Germany choose university. Most go for trades/technical schools. Germans also have a strong work ethic, which Americans lack.Bernie, why be so stingy, let raise the min wage to 50 dollars an hour.Lots of unsatisfying responses from Bernie when Joe would ask how he plans on doing his policies. Happy he came on but it left me less sure of his positions.I would label myself a Conservative but even I believe in free health care for American citizens. How could Trump preach freedom but we&#39;re burdened with an extra insurance fee that we didn&#39;t ask for? Health care should be a universal human right. Big pharma companies, are (like Joe said) greedy. I believe in border control. You should have to pay for an education... but not health careFalling asleep!....Unfortunately he won’t be president :(Fuck Bernie....He hates America, and he hates the American way. FUCK HIM!!!!!!!Finally!!!EPICBernie claims trump is a white supremacist yet he cant prove it.Haven&#39;t watched yet.. please tell me Bernie pulled an Elon muskLMAO get Trump on the podcastAmerica&#39;s DAD! Love you Bernie!This might surpass the Elon Musk video in viewsBernie is not to big on eye contact huh? He looks defeated. I couldn&#39;t be comfortable with this man as president.If you support holiday Clinton , you should be destroyed ultimatelyLet’s goooLynden Johnson destroyed the countryShit.😭😭😭🤮That dude&#39;s been playing WoW for 15 years straight. Permanent neck braceI want to see Donald Trump on here and I would really love to see Bero O&#39;Rourke get exposed in a long form format.This is crazyyyyyyy I love you joe roganBernie for president!<b>A NOTE TO ALL VIEWERS</b> <br />Before you make a hasty decision about this man, or any other person for that matter, kindly do your research. Don’t decide based on your emotions. Do not hate the man just because he’s a “liberal” (a word derived from liberty, why is that a bad thing?), or a “socialist” (a term most of us don’t understand fully, myself included). Don’t be put off just because he doesn’t possess a label you are familiar and comfortable with. Think. Use your fucking head. It’s there for a reason. The human race would not be here today if we were meant to waste away on mindless media activities and live solely for entertainment. Judge based on objective fact. Make decisions rooted in logical and rational principles. And in this vein of thought, it is NOT rational to have a country of millions working to death, while a lucky few accumulate massive profits that do not get redistributed into our economy. That is stagnation. Stagnation is detrimental. Down with greed, and down with fools that “believe” (and I say believe because most that would argue with me do not know what the fuck they are talking about) it is okay. It is not okay. We are all Americans, and we are all human. WHAT HAPPENED TO LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. Nowadays it’s live in perceived liberty so that your life and energy can provide for someone else’s happiness, someone who usually not only doesn’t give a damn about you, but sees you as a lesser. We have so much goddamn money in this country, yet 1 out of 6 American children do not get enough food to eat on a daily basis. What the actual fuck. We care more about the Kardashian’s ass implants than we do about the homeless. Enough filling your brain with useless information, enough wasting your life worrying about the non-essential. Worry about the problems of the now, for the future is being made as we speak, and your action, or inaction, changes everything friends.UghHoly shitThis deep fake shit is wild son....Donald Trump next?HOly fuckig hell ripping this while i make dinnerBernie sounds genuine but how he bent over and let Hillary sodomize him in 2016 makes me not respect him at allNo offense to Joe but you know something is wrong when he gives a more fair interview to Bernie than anyone in corporate media does.This is the best platform for Bernie and other candidates for that fact since they can put across the table all there points and even be refuted cause Joe is no chump when he hears BS (wish he could have a small debate and have Shapiro, Pool, Crowder and Dore doing the questions and Joe moderating). These neutral platforms are needed since they give the same opportunities and the time they need to show the people who they are as a human, candidate and potential president of the USA.GETTYT TRUMP OR WILLIAMSON!Am I too stoned or is that really Bernie Sanders? Have Trump and Kanye in the future.I liked Bernie in 2015 but Hillary made me love trump<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MakeAmericaBernAgain">#MakeAmericaBernAgain</a>Bahahahahhahahahaha. Gtfo look at this mook.&quot;the idea of free education&quot;<br />Its not an idea Joe. Its reality. Just not in your countryWhich house is he flying back to after the interview is over?This made my day!So ban ARs and AKs, but let&#39;s keep pistols 🤷🏻‍♂️  and have a limited on how many guns you can have.Really wish Joe would push back on some of this crap.Oh christ.BERNIE 2020 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FEELTHEBERN">#FEELTHEBERN</a>&quot;exciting&quot; Joe&#39;s opening setup. About as exciting as an enema.This guys real name is Bernie Gracie.Don Trump... the guy that weaseled his diaper wearing ASS into the WH. Refreshing to hear compassion &amp; intelligence. Joe VP/ Bernie idk maybe. LolAm i the only who said &quot;wtf&quot; outloud when they saw the name in the tittle.Have been listening to this so far. Can&#39;t help but to give Joe credit for the great questions.I do like how Joe Rogan treats everyone the same in interviews.Bernie is such a retard. Absolute dumbass.  <br /><br />Why is Healthcare not a ‘right’? Because you can’t guarantee forced labour, you socialist asshole.What a rambling dispassionate old fool.150k views in 20 minBernie is the 1%Your a BUM BERNIE! GET A JOB!Joe Rogan is truly a man of the people. No matter what side you&#39;re on, you have to respect his commitment to getting people&#39;s voices heard. Literally revolutionizing the game.Health care is NOT a human right. it requires someone else to serve you. You have NO right to force someone to provide ANY service for you.You better grill him!It’s like a communist version of tales from the cryptFuck you Bernie.  How about gun owners shove their guns up your ass.first you minimize gun violence and ownership then you socialize healthcare and promote therapy because US has millions of unstable people that go unchecked because they can&#39;t afford paying for therapy or anxiety medication, you guys are fucking yourselves over pride.Bernie is the people&#39;s candidate!Please check out my music. Im just a young man with a dream trying to spread positivity.<br /><br />Thank YoyI get that people, especially old people, associate socialism with Nazis and the Soviet Union but nowadays it&#39;s more closely and accurately associated with places like Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands aka statistically the happiest and nicest places in the world to live. Also I notice a lot of republicans can accept socialism when it means bailing out banks, corporations and farmers affected by trumps &quot;easy to win&quot; trade war.Bernie’s not smart enough to be in the same room with JoeThe Gulag Experience PodcastLol Bernie can’t even defend his microphone from 2 women.If Trump is smart he’ll go on the podcast too!Crowder really has let his Bernie slip....I am no fan of Bernie Sanders but. I am willing to listen to what he has to say. Good podcast JoeTake it from someone who works in medicine. Medicare does not pay for shit. They will fight tooth and nail for every cent. Including an 80 year old diabetic&#39;s insulin. They deny everything left and right. It is not a good system to model the rest of the country after.Bro if joe makes him hit the joint its over bernie wins lolAre you srs lolI was really hoping that Joe was gonna light up a blunt with BernieGOD BLESS BERNIE SANDERS!Lmao this old man isn&#39;t going to last a couple more months let alone 5 more yearssorry Joe had to give it a thumbs down before even watching it.Trump said video games caused the recent shootings...lol. what a moron.Joe 2024Joe:  Berrnie, you ever take DMT?  What’s your thoughts on legalization?Bernie is the MVP of AmericaI don’t want one dime of my taxes going to western medicine other than the emergency room. Big pharmaceutical and medical devices are the biggest scam since wonder bread.YAAAAAYYY Socialism🙄But.......did he offer Bernie some elk meat and a free ride in his float tank??Raising the minimum wage is stupid. The CEO’s and shareholders will avoid that hit like the plague and make life more miserable for their employees through layoffs and making people do twice the work for the 1/3rd bump in pay which really shouldn’t equal needing more productivity from the employee. There needs to be a profit ratio wage. After a certain point the profits these companies are making off their labor force is an exploitation. The wages need to rise as the company does better and maybe even lower as the company does worse. Something. It’s certainly more complicated than just raising the wage.Go Tulsi 2020!I’m disappointed that Joe isn’t pushing back on any of these claims. The idea that Amazon doesn’t pay taxes because of ‘power’ alone is a fallacy. I’m an accountant, and they did not pay taxes in 2018 for incredibly basic tax code reasons, not because of some deep state conspiracyI am a neo liberal but its time to join the Bernie train to tackle the issuesOng its bernieeeeee!!!!!!! I voted for him in 2016.If Joe would&#39;ve run for president, he&#39;d probably win it all to be honest.Another error . . . there is PLENTY of lobbying in the healthcare field in Canada.Can’t wait for all the arguments between retards that don’t know anything about the topics they argue about in hereIf he was a candidate for president of Wet Lips, he would win!!Fucking legendary, so glad it came out while um highOh how I would love to see Trump in that seat next.Upping the levels my dudeDoc Brown meets Joe Rogan. It&#39;s finally happened.Thank you Joe and Bernie.A Socialist with little understanding of basic level economics, to say the least, it was very interesting to listen to.Joe Rogan, Yung Jamie - could you please interview every candidate? You would be more of an American hero than you already are.Bernie is an idealist, not a realist...When will Joe have conservative candidates?<br />So far. Tulsi. Yang. And Sanders. Are the only ones he’s had that I can think of. <br />I’d love to hear some conservatives that are going to battle trump.Get Trump on here!I’d love to see a special 3 hour episode where a Democrat  and a Republican come in knowing that they are going to have to talk about and defend their opinions on a variety of important issues the general public find important and let them duke it out! That way they can’t hide behind the short answer and will have to give a detailed opinion using facts while Jamie does the fact checking and than the viewers can decide who made the defense of their beliefsLove Bernie, but he is stuck in the past and the old tech.Would not leave him near my children, that&#39;s for sureThis asshole cant answer straight to save his lifePay your fair share BernieEvery American, regardless of how much money they have, deserves healthcare, a living wage, and a place to live as a right, not a privilege to be given to them by the 1%. I&#39;m glad to see Bernie articulating his progressive message everywhere and I hope that Joe Rogan fans hear what he has to say in good faith.Bernie puts me to sleep.The mad lad did it.2024 the Joe rogan debates. <br /><br />Joe: do you know the benefits of dmt.<br /><br />Candidate: Dmt is the greatest.<br /><br />Joe Post debate: he clearly won the debateWhat&#39;s a yuman rite?Joe Rogan has on EVERYBODY IN THIS PODCAST.<br />There&#39;s no particular agenda. You must be new here if you think he&#39;s pushing Bernie.Now have trump and make him do DMTI&#39;m a Libertarian, more so right leaning, and Bernie actually speaks some real truths, I just don&#39;t vibe with the freebies, and the debt issues and how to fix them, but he&#39;s arguably the most reasonable voice on the left running for president. He makes the rest look like clowns.<b>JOE IS THE WHITE CHARLEMAGNE, I LOVE HIM MORE AFTER THIS ONE, IM ABOUT TO SHOWER, ROLL UP, N WATCH THIS ON DA BIG SCREEN</b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SandersWarren2020">#SandersWarren2020</a> thanx JoeHave Covington on not this boring sack of shit&quot;It is legal because they make the laws.&quot;<br />Yup.No waydelusional grandpaThis dude will never be president. Look at his body language all hunched over n shit. This is the same guy who let two women rip a microphone from his hands hows he going to represent our country with powerful leaders gtfohI&#39;m 7min in and I damn near fell asleep, then I remembered brainwashing device and decided to comment and leave. He&#39;s not smokingHey Joe. If you can get Donny on, and get him to smoke one of those hog leg joints with you, I bet we might see the real deal for once.  Better yet...get he and Bernie to swap inside leg kicks and I&#39;ll vote for the last man standing.Every Canadian I know comes to America to get health care because theirs sucks. Bernie is lying.They&#39;re not bringing up the meaning crisis.Eliminate student debt and college costs, raise the minimum wage to a living wage and reduce the cost of health care? You got my vote!I&#39;m feelin&#39; the Berni paid off my 60k in student debt, that would be 180k today, so do I just get a check  for that?This clown talks about Canadian Health Care like hes got a clue...problems is a understatement.Climate change is real ,but US &quot;MEN&quot; don;&#39;t have much to do with cycles one volcano eruption can screw things up for like a good 30 years ....It&#39;s like listening to my grandfather when he would keep nodding off and mumbling a few months before he died.Stupid CommieAnyone waiting for joe to hand him a blunt lolI will never have respect for a socialist. Not after:<br />People&#39;s Republic of China<br />People&#39;s Republic of North Korea<br />Venezuela<br />Cuba<br />USSR<br />Laos<br />Vietnam<br />Angola<br />Bulgaria<br />Cambodia<br />Syria<br />Ethiopia<br />Mongolia<br />Mozambique<br />Somalia<br />North Vietnam (VietCong)<br />South Yemen<br />Algeria<br />Bangladesh<br />Guyana<br />Burma<br />Sri Lanka<br />Egypt<br />Grenada<br />Madagascar<br />Sudan<br />Zambia<br />The Congo<br />Azerbaijan<br />And other failed socialist states resulted in the deaths of (arguably) hundreds of millions of people worldwide through famine and Facism. No respect from meI don’t think I’ve ever heard Bernie speak in a low voice:O<br /><br />That makes three candidates, one of which is a darling of the Dems, has gone on Rogan<br /><br />Are podcast tours gonna be part of campaigning now?<br /><br />Is Bernie gonna light up during this podcast?<br /><br />I don&#39;t know what this all means, but I&#39;m stunned to see Rogan&#39;s personal interviewing/podcasting skills are so good presidential candidates are now doing thisDaddy Bernie 😘😍❤️This is the podcast where people call Joe Rogan a bleeding heart liberal. But Seriously though <br />WHO IS STILL WATCHING TELEVISION? <br />More importantly WHY? <br />What Joe is doing right here is what the process needs. <br /><br />I have little interest in what Bernie’s talking points are for the most part, but I totally agree with him or other candidates being able to  talk at length about their respective platforms, without grandstanding and screaming and what have you.Get trump on hereTop 3 people have more than the lower half? And he doesnt ask who they are?! joe?!!?!Have Marianne Williamson on!!!If Graham Hancock had a twin brother... 🤔KagggggggSeems a million times more sincere and level headed then our current president. He has my voteBernie got something against workin at McDonalds? Huh Workin at McDonalds ain&#39;t shit? That&#39;s some fucked up shit. I thought he was a man of the people. Man of the worker the underclass and undervalued human. What a hypocrite. I&#39;m voting for Trump. At least I have a job. I might not have one if Bernie becomes president. Bye Felicia.This is gonna break the internetNOTHING that requires the efforts of another person can be considered a Human Right.  That is called slavery.HE&#39;S A FUCKIN SOCIALIST...NO THANKSMAGAAAAAAAAAAOne reason to love Joe... He has no problem with different views from different ppl I don&#39;t like Sanders but it&#39;s nice to hear him speak his mind fully on your channeli wanted Bernie sanders to be president since he first ranFucking love me some Larry DavidAs per usual Bernie using false terms and facts to push a gun control narrativeInB4 Steven Crowder picks this whole damn thing to pieces.Guaranteed healthcare does not guarantees good quality of care, stop lying to yourselves.Bernie promised a lot of free goodies as most of his liberal cohorts do also,but they have to take some of Joes money to do it lol.4 volves voting with 3 sheep,whats for dinner.I LOVE me some BernieYeah but I thought the insatiable greed of corporations is what makes America the greatest. Money is free speech and corruption isnt a problem. I thought all our problems come from Mexico and welfare queensHere&#39;s the problem:<br /><br />Raise minimum wage and cost of living will go up.<br /><br />Raise minimum wage and nobody will work hard for more.<br /><br />Raise minimum wage and businesses will lay everyone off, causing mass unemployment.Bernie refused to pay his own staff $15/hr, he cut their hours instead...canadian quality of care is not as good or better than in the US, unless you condsider waiting  forever for basic surgery a positiveBernie &quot; I hate America but love Venezuela&quot; SandersI can’t wait to fall asleep during this one.POWERFUL JREBernie has a spitting problem when he speaks, he probably spit on the microphone more than Monica Lewinsky spit on Bill Clinton.Somebody explain a Pareto distribution to Bernie pleaseWe’re gonna be gone in 12 years right aoc and bernie?WhaaaatYou yanks are fucked. Here&#39;s an idea to all of you feeling triggered by a single mans not even wholly socialist politics, take your assault riffle to the mall and commit mass murder, that&#39;s the in thing to do isn&#39;t it. Oh I forgot your cuntpuppet president blames that on immigrants, the same people that built your shithole country, not the conservative white males that actually commit these heinous crimes, just remember all those people died on the weekend because one of those white boys didn&#39;t like the fact that there are Hispanic people in Texas (one of the states you forget belongs to mexico) and the other white boy, thought that black people are stinky and just suck. <br />Your all fucked, the second american civil war is coming and it won&#39;t end well for your empire.Jamie already deleting comments, thisbdick you socialist fuckboiSANDERS BRAVO 2020I&#39;m going to vote for President Trump in 2020 :) LOL Crazy Socialist Bernie no thank you. I&#39;ll keep my paycheck to spend how I choose :)Trump next! 🤣🤣🤣Yang Gang 2020 !Get Tucker Carlson on already Jesus Christit&#39;s time to get trump on<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>Bernie plans on spending his retirement opening a jar.I’m disappointed with the length. Is this the shortest Rogan interview ever? I’m genuinely asking.Powerful Joe talking to multiple Presidential Candidate&#39;s.&quot;(...)bedigare(...)&quot;<br />- Bernie Sanders, 2019vote this man in or we&#39;ll end up in another war I believe.If every candidate did a few hour interview w/joe. We would be infinitely better off than these trash debates. Coincidentally Yang, Tulsi, and Bernie are my top 3. <br />If you get Joe Biden, the podcast has to be #30330Giving Bernie a shot and I&#39;m listening with an open mind. But I&#39;m halfway through and hearing the same fundamental difference that he has always had with the core of the what America is... That is FREEDOM. Yes, there&#39;s people in awful positions financially and medically.. But how many of those situations are self-inflicted due to a complex consequence of thier own decisions?? It is the majority.. Period. I am free, you are free, we are all free to suffer the consequences of our own actions BUT also the blessings of our own actions. Philosophically, if Bernie wants to help others with all his ideas, GREAT! Love it! So go into charity/religious work. Helping others via grace and mercy should be a choice. Morality isn&#39;t morality if its forced by a government.Don’t be fooled. I’m Canadian, and our healthcare system is not what it’s made out to be. Its 11% of our GDP and rising. Wait times in emergency rooms are outrageous and it’s not always easy to get a doctor. However, the standard of care is high and it is comforting to have this safety net- it’s just not all sunshine and happiness though Bernie is making it sound like. It’s an enormous expense on the country<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=20m05s">20:05</a>, joe is right, people under 18 should make less than the minimum wage, but the minimum wage needs to be raised and all we need to do is tax the fuck outa the motherfuckers in the    <br />00.1 percent, fuck those guys I ain’t one of them, you ain’t one of them, nobody you know is one of them, they are alright with fucking you over and paying you or your peers $10 an hour, why isn’t this guy the leader of the whole fucking world? Because he supports Mexicans, so what, he supports you, Trump doesn’t support Mexicans or you so why can’t people get over that, he’s supporting you and he doesn’t have a price that companies can pay to keep fucking your aging parents out of money for medication that they need. You can’t argue with that unless ur in the top .1% and not many people are, let’s get him in so 99.9% of America can start being supportedbernie the hypocrite ,remember the dnc screwed you.....but you are still a fraud and gaslighting propagandist.Bernie and other independents need to get away from the DNCI work for medicare. It&#39;s actually horrible. That&#39;s it not radical. Lol okay bro. You&#39;re now on charge of my health. Fuck thatIs he talking to the table orrrrrrrrrr 🤔Only reason I&#39;m watching.It&#39;s 5 minutes and it&#39;s stated its a political broadcast on behalf of the X partyRemember Bernie doesn&#39;t get his hair cut. He just has them take off the top 1%I think Rogan should use his platform to interview important ppl, this interview with his dad was cute but who really cares about itShould have had redban sit in like the old days.I&#39;ve never seen someone so fascinated with Joe&#39;s table. It&#39;s the only thing he looks at lmao.i just noticed i have root rot developing on my weed plants and its making me very sadHour per hour, teachers are overpaid. Teachers work summer jobs because they have summers off.I want to see Trump on the podcastThis is why we love you. This was a great interview.I&#39;d love to know how vetted this interview was. Before and after the conversation.Wtf...ugh..these guests lately suck.-CanadianJoe for presidentEh, I’m voting yang stillI don’t trust BS and I don’t trust Bernie Sanders.This got me so excited, and I&#39;m more of the conservative type. Honestly, I like his views on healthcare. That&#39;s a big democrat strong point. Still voting for Trump this election, but I really hope Bernie runs again afterwards.F*** you Bernie keep your hands off my weaponsBernie has appeal when he fights cronyism and corruption. When he panders to the Left and acts like he cares about LGBTQIABCDEFG insanity and opening borders he becomes a hollow politician with no soul to his platform. He could have been president but he chose to bow down to the top CUNT Hillary Clinton as she stole the 2016 Democratic Primary. That’s why SETH RICH stole the emails and released them. He was killed for it. I’m voting for Trump again in 2020 but I wouldn’t mind if he became President. Too bad he won’t be the nominee because he’s too moderate for the New Democratic Party.An hour of Bernie saying “I’m not radical”Bernie is an old fraud.Jesus joe, what&#39;s with the kid gloves. Great job getting pres candidates on the show but, do enough research to ask follow up questions when he &quot;we are the only country in the world that....&quot;<br />Or even better, get him angry enough to start waving his hands all about and expose his real motives... break thru to the next level and away from MSM formatThe one and only Bernie Tanders!!“12 years” must be a magic number for climate change I heard “12 years” ever since the 80’s now 2019 it’s still 12 yearsRogan: &quot;Will DMT be available on medicare for all?&quot;Amazon was losing money for years. AKA as my money in the form of selling a stock. Now they make a profit and they are rolling those losses forward. This makes the few stocks I own worth something. Use Capitalism to your advantage. Sanders makes it sound like we are all on the outside looking in and that his just not the case.Bring Trump on.... The internet will explodeI want 3 hours of bernie!He doesn&#39;t look Joe in the eyes. that bugs me.tulsi had real answersThis is the best thing Bernie could do for his campaignThanks Joe rogan for having Bernie Sanders on the podcastBernie is a nutter, but more power to him for coming on.I just wanna punch Bernie In the chest an make his shoulders touchBernie Tulsi 2020 🔥👊👌Meanwhile, all those &quot;billionaires&quot; have their &quot;wealth&quot; locked up in stocks that Bernie and every other 401k, retirement plan, etc have been profiting off of since time immemorial. These people are not sitting on cash. High stock valuations benefit everyone - including other businesses. This is far more complex than I think Bernie understands despite having all the time in the world to do so in his lifetime. Ron Paul has always been the more intelligent grandpa candidate.Why this gentleman is not the president of the United States of America?  He has very good ideas for health and education.  This is what the country should really care about.  money and power america already has enough.#1 podcastSay no to socialism!Joe physically himself pushes the Microphone closer to a 84 year old Man whom is running for President of the USofA ..  All while on record of not agreeing with or respecting a single individual representing that level of authority in relation to the highest Office of &quot;Public Service&quot; in the landJust remember, the bar of soap you lather up with: is sh*bleep*What the.... I wouldn&#39;t have ever expected this.This interview is was so softball, absolutely patheticI&#39;m gonna push back a small bit about the minimum wage. The main employers that will be able to afford over twice what the minimum is now will be the large multi national companies. Most small businesses won&#39;t be able to absorb that added expense. That is of course not saying anything towards the amount of inflation raising it will cause.HOLY FUCKING SHITONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH TO NOT OFFER HEALTH-CARE AS A HUMAN RIGHT! Thankyou sir for speaking for my future kids.Healthcare is not a right. It requires labor. Nothing that requires another person&#39;s labor is a right. EVER.Act of 1871 might be why. Congress is the only power to order the striking of are coin them and are land and all it possess can make it solvent if i&#39;m wrong the Constitution article 1 Section 8 needs attention.Get Pete on there. Afghan war vet. Fascinating dudeJoe is mad at us for some reason...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=35m28s">35:28</a> It’s always illegal to sell a gun to a criminal or someone who is not allowed to purchase one.This was excellent. Thank you for giving Bernie a chance to voice his policy views to a lot of people that ordinarily would not have heard him out.He really should be the one to handle one of the debatesGiving this psycho liar a platform completely delegitimizes you.Bernie is out of his mind. Edit: Joe really needs to learn about economics. He has no clue either. You pay for SS by NOT giving it to illegals!!!Thank you Joe! Dr. Cornel West and Bernie Sanders in the same week. &lt;3Now have Trump on.This podcast wasn’t live right?!?Hope Bernie whips Biden&#39;s assHow much did you cut out before publishing?Joe is such a rare outlet for professional athletes, political figures, scientists, CEOs, and old silver tongued socialists what a world.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏for elpaso and Dayton my homePretty sure that&#39;s TrumpMan I hate how joe just lets him spew his &quot;facts&quot; about stuff and doesnt challenge him on things that are widely known to be incorrect such as the minimum wage increase. Joe plays softball with all his lefties. Show me which scientists claim this 12 year doomsday counter for the environment, show me the countries rated with better healthcare than the US by mortality rates that run a socialized healthcare, show me proof (there isnt any) that increasing the minimum wage actually increases those people&#39;s buying power. Increasing the minimum wage just increases inflation because theres no legislature in place that says when theres a minimum wage increase, companies cant just up their prices to make the same money as before, which is exactly what they do. Most of what Bernie says is...based on I think and I feel and not numbers.2,000+ non open minded peopleHow in the world did this thing get 2500 dislikes that quickly. Are you guys just clicking on it and disliking the video?You should definitely get Trump on here. People get the wrong idea of him because of the corrupt media. He&#39;s not as bad as people think. He&#39;s been talking about America&#39;s problems &amp; has talked about the idea of president for over 30 years &amp; now he&#39;s actually been doing a good job as our president. Give him a chance! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305-erOr3jk&amp;list=LLknSJaopaxOdBfJeC_TC2rw&amp;index=44&amp;t=1679s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305-erOr3jk&amp;list=LLknSJaopaxOdBfJeC_TC2rw&amp;index=44&amp;t=1679s</a>Hey Bernie!  My dad had a triple bypass the bill was 250k he was responsible for 800 bucks.  800 friggin bucks for heart surgery and a week in top tier hospital.  Don&#39;t tell me about health care costs.  He&#39;s old he worked his whole life and now he has a pension and medicare.  Living on a fixed income barely able to support himself but he paid 800 bucks for open heart surgery.  Stop misleading people.  Hospitals take into consideration that most people can&#39;t pay and they write off the loss so they pay no taxes.  This whole idea that you can&#39;t go to an emergency room or call an ambulance is bullshit.  We have the best doctors and the best EMTs and they work here because they make alot of money.  You want shit doctors?  I don&#39;t.  The drug companies are another situation.  Those pieces of shit put out meds they know cause side effects and will kill a certain % of people and they don&#39;t care.  The meds aren&#39;t safe.  In addition they gouge everyone for pills that cost pennies.  Did you know the cure for hep c is pills for 2 months and those pills cost 60k.  Why?  because its a cure and they can&#39;t make you pay for the rest of your life like insulin or blood pressure meds.  Bernie you are a naive naive person that is using fear to try and change our government into a communist untopia.  There is no utopia and I&#39;d rather die than live in a communist nation.  You will lose.Free education will make the quality drop. The reason universities and colleges can maintain a high level of education is because they can afford to pay good teachers and professors. But as soon as you make it free, the demand for classes will sky rocket and the salary for teachers and professors will drop because where does the money come from? So you get shittier education from free colleges.Cool, now bring Donald Trump on your show! MAGA!!!!Bernie isn&#39;t gonna win because he&#39;s honest and actually wants to make things better...now have someone on that will debunk all this lunatics lies pleaseaaaaand here come all the internet &quot;TUFF&quot; guys to talk a bunch shit! 😂😂cant believe bernie is on JRE. FEELTHEBERN!!!ASMR level 1000....I cannot listen to this shitour only hopeBernie also doesn&#39;t mention how long you have to wait for things that are considered &quot;elective&quot;.  Over two decades ago I waited six months for something as simple as an arthroscopic procedure on my knee.  the Canadian system is great if you are at risk of your life.  If it is not a life-threatening issue, you will wait weeks if not months.Thanks Joe  for finally bringing real lefties like Bernie. - I hope you endorse Bernie soon. I knew you were always were a leftist. 👍Bernie Sanders is just talk and no action typical politics.Tulsi gabbard and now crazy Bernie? I think the next ghost is Christmas future, as I recall.Joe Rogan: Bernie, single payer healthcare,  Free Public college, and higher hourly wages sound cool, but have you tried DMT?Joe would get ol donny trump to hit that blunt lol 😂Okay. Let&#39;s get Trump on next.Genuinely surprised to see him in my notificationWhy would you even waste your time with this lunatic?Bernie Sanders &quot;White people don&#39;t know what its like to be poor&quot; 🖕 u bernie and the democrat communists.Oh shit. This was a surpriseOnce I saw the thumbnail, my fucking mouth dropped.Get President Trump on the show...<br />I triple double dog dare you!I&#39;ve been a surgeon my entire adult life, I haven&#39;t been that much of a fan of Bernie Sanders, mostly because I just don&#39;t see how my industry can be reformed in anything under a decade. Not without hurting both medical care providers and patients. Maybe with a solid decade of methodical, constant, and deliberate change led by people who are NOT politicians - it might be possible. <br />Where he wins me over, is his stance on drug companies. They&#39;re damn ghouls and they&#39;re literally bankrupting poor and middle class families by charging many hundreds of times what a drug is worth in comparison to other countries. And I don&#39;t have a choice when it comes to legally prescribing anything else. It&#39;s one of the biggest scams perpetuated against the American people by dirty politicians and pharmaceutical lobbyists.<br /><br /><br />Also, I&#39;m only 35 minutes in, but this man makes Trump sound like he&#39;s had a full lobotomy.<br />Trump is NOT a smart man.Get Donald Trump on! 😂Please vote Bernie America...Awesome!Nobody: <br /><br />Bernie Sanders for everything: &quot;the top one percent&quot; &quot;Medicare for all&quot; blah blah blahFINALLY!Comparing health care in Canada with its small population and America is just stupid. The survival rates for cancer patients like a lot mayor diseases, in America is much higher than Britain where I live.Wow Bernie this is nuts now let&#39;s talk pot legalizationSocialist alert!People like Bernie that think Americans own assault weapons is either so stupid they dont know the definition of assault weapon. Or they are liars<b>Here lies the argument that Joe panders to the Alt-right</b>I love Bernie Sanders everything he said was facts. America is screwed and people are to dumb to wake up and realize this🤦😔Bernieeeee 🤗 ❤️ 2020What a fucking platform this is<br />Biggest JRE fanbernie also wants medicare for illegal undocumented immigrants....Our Canadian healthcare system is very flawed and only getting worse due to open borders. What a jokeWhy can you not just admit health care is a privilege and still fight for universal healthcare. It’s that simple. It’s not a right. Doesn’t mean you can’t fight for itBernie your a politician that makes massive amounts of profit being a politician.... you vouch for higher wages for the working class yet dont/wont  even pay your own employees $15 per hour, and when they ask you to put your money where your mouth is you do but then in turn limit their hours of work. Also dont shit about humans poisoning the environment then climb on your fucking jet to sit into your million dollar home with expensive security measures and a wall around you.cAN WE PLEASE get Bernie some waterBernie you’ve never run a businessLMAO Bernie is a Commie, that is trying to destroy America through economic warfare. The democrats/Globalists choose the most incompetent people to run for President.Have not started it yet, but I have a prediction.  JR is going to agree with everything Bernie says even though in the past he says his policies won&#39;t work and then mentions Venezuela.Bernie you forgot to add it takes months to get heart surgery in CA. By that time you are deceasedon diabetes <br />If you google it right now,  100 million adults are living with pre/diabetes in America<br />In Canada 2.3 million people 12 years and older have diabetes <br />According to supply and demand <br />I wonder why prices are high for insulin  in America...Bernie does not understand the Free Market. How is he going to do all of this without raising taxes, and using legislation to take away peoples freedoms.If you don’t bring up DNC corruption and vote rigging Joe I’m gonna be a disappointCan you bring Donald Trump on the show?lolwutWhether you agree with Bernie or not, it&#39;s refreshing to hear a politician explain the why&#39;s and the how&#39;s of their policy proposals in longform conversation. Thank you Bernie and Joe!Holy ShitI could not care less faggot shitBernie will loves America so much he conforms....   im glad I won&#39;t have to work anymore so I can have everything that I wanted free.....or is that just for ILLEGALS???     oh yeah...  RACIST!!!!So full of emotions. Not really answering the questions though. I&#39;m not convinced.Joe “Shill” RoganI&#39;m not a Bernie Sanders supporter, but it is refreshing to hear a Democrat actually be bale to expand on a point even a little bit.Bernie is a millionaire socialist parasite who hasn&#39;t done a day&#39;s work in his life and who believes that there aren&#39;t any white people living in poverty.Imagine not so much of a bootlicker that you don&#39;t like Bernie lmaoLol this is real what an amazing time to be alive.Why would you even want that low life stupid piece of shit on your showufff this guy is a retard.I am a Libertarian so i do enjoy listening to differing viewpoints. The fact Bernie has a TRUE place to talk about his ideals is extremely great. I do disagree heavily with his implementation of alot of it. I think he is slightly misguided in the large effects of them aswell.  However I do not think he is some evil old man. I think his heart is genuinely in the right place. I think he truly wants the best for citizens and their well being. Which is honestly saying alot more than any other of both sides candidates.&quot;assault weapons&quot; every time. What if i assault somebody with a spoon?Dumpster fire.Trump needs to get on hereNow we need one where Bernie, Trump, and Joe all smoke and have a conversation.Fuck the minimum wage and tax loop holes. Money will always breed power if the government is big.Bernie is a far better candidate than the other candidates  that actually have a shot at winning. Choosing Biden, would be the same mistake as choosing Clinton last time. Biden is an establishment Democrat, and he is the continuation of the status quo, which isn&#39;t what people want. People want positive change, not same old same old, or negative change under Trump or any Republican administration denying science, logic, and embracing religious extremism. Bernie isn&#39;t communist, he isn&#39;t radical, he isn&#39;t extreme. He just wants the richest country in the history of the world to join other advanced nations in providing free health care, free upper education and make the lives of working people better. Those Republicans shitting on him, are shitting on themselves out of ignorance to what Bernie truly represents.How TF have people already seen this entire video when it was just uploaded 30 minutes ago!!?😭Joe, you are a true renaissance man.Instead of noone under 35 years old can be president, it should be noone over 35 years old!!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=14m15s">14:15</a> the tax dollars also go to your 3 houses mr millionaire.The corporate right is against Bernie, the corporate left is against him as well. This might mean somethingAsk him why he let Sethe Riche die in vaneMy ad blocker was automatically turned on for this podcast, free ads for all.The companies that pay the youth workforce 15 or 16 an hr will make money from those 15 year olds when they spend their paychecks.If I agree with Bernie or not im  Just impressed with the fact that politicians are coming on jre, and the fact that Joe has broken through. From getting high on podcast and talking bs to talking to politicians is impressive.A podcast with trump would be more than an hourdog whistle= white rights/alliesYES!!!!! IT FUCKING HAPPENED!!!Wow, all praise to Joe for this amazing podcast that he runs!<br />Everything from B-Real blazing up and talking about losing shoes during show&#39;s to presidential candidatesI’m curious to see if at some point Joe gets Bernie in a headlock and tries to stretch his neck out... or mentions his neck and yoga or somethingJRE is the better than any &quot;debate.&quot; We&#39;re seeing the future of how candidates will speak to the masses right nowI cant skip past the ads lololol fuck you faggots fade into death Rogan.Wow so medical drug companies have corrupt power to turn the political tides,thats just crazy and i think i agree on bernie sanders with this<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Edit:this world is gonna fucking collapse in 12 years if we continue this idiotic corrupt shitFeel the Bern!Bernie 2020!!There is a saying. If you were young and not a socialist, you are a bad person. If you are old and still a socialist, you are an idiot.The more I listen to him, it becomes blatantly clear that regardless of who is president without doing away with professional politicians.  Term limits to congress... NO superPAC’s etc...Noticed how hackneyed the comments are? When Kyle Kulinski came to the show with nearly identical talking points, these people agree with him. But when a self described &quot;socialist&quot; comes to the show with those points, these &quot;open minded&quot; people immediately get triggeredBooby Lee would&#39;ve been a better guest.Mazol Tov!This guy ran in the same race as trump, trump got voted in. What is going on in America 😂 what a joke.Maybe I’ve lost the plot but I’ve been hearing about this guy being anti-American etc... He spent the first 15 mins talking about how drug companies should not be able to monopolize the market and rape us with insane price hikes. What’s anti-American about this? Am I off? If I’m in an alleged free market why do I pay ten times what a Canadian pays for insulin? You would tell Starbucks to fuck off if they charged $50 for a cup of coffee.Joe “the G.O.A.T.” Rogan  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The best guests everI thought I might have learned something from this but nope, nothing but debunked 1000 times over npc talking points. Boring.I just heard about this! I hope Bernie looks like the retard he is.Thank you Joe, great job getting Bernie...finally!💚  I think I remember that you have been trying for a while w/no response yeah. Dude, and allowing a fair and honest discourse with Bernie, simply priceless!Noticed how hackneyed the comments are? When Kyle Kulinski came to the show with nearly identical talking points, these people agree with him. But when a self described &quot;socialist&quot; comes to the show with those points, these &quot;open minded&quot; people immediately get triggeredBring Trump on!no way haha, Bernie!?!?💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎The biggest waste of an hour ever and it&#39;s been out 30 minutesDadThis is Rad! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23OurRevolution">#OurRevolution</a>Awesome podcast.

Ohh no, they banned plastic bags, that&#39;s right.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>  still...I think Bernie is generally a nice guy and I think he doesn&#39;t mean harm. I just don&#39;t agree with his politics.Too bad he wants to turn America into Venezuela 2.0america get behind BERNIE!   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BACKBERNIE">#BACKBERNIE</a>5 minutes in already spreading liesYou&#39;re only having Bernie because people like him if you watch the videos you actually Bash him quite a bit.No fucking way that old mfCan&#39;t wait for the trump show! Bernie is boring as fuck.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yang2020">#yang2020</a>Hahahahaahhhaahhahahah yo unsubbed this is just horse shit now fuck the fuck off joe Rogan. Politics and shit fuck you.Joe&#39;s is a big Star now, for him to bring on a guy that&#39;s never had a real job, and let him give his views . . . Well that&#39;s just vary down to earth  👏<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Calm down Calm down  it&#39;s just . . . . well true 😉🧂... What about fixing the VA...? How do you expect me to believe this When we can&#39;t even get that part of the goverment right? ... Good conversation though. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23respect">#respect</a>joe needs to get trump on.I have somebody who has multiple families were in the medical field and friends and family that live in Canada a lot of them come here for healthcare because while it&#39;s cheaper it also takes three to four times as on to get the same Healthcare you would get here. For minor Healthcare issues it&#39;s great but once it comes to important Medical issues like heart disease a lot of Canadians come to the u.s. because Money TalksYou don&#39;t get a bill in Canada because you have already PAID for it through taxation.And tomorrow Andrew Yang is on H3 Podcast!  What a time.As a Canadian I wish Bernie would be more honest about some of the problems with Canadian healthcare. Yes it&#39;s free, but I am unable to access the best and newest treatments unless I go to the United States. Also, wait times to see specialists take months to years. Personally, I want the option to be able to pay to get better treatment. It&#39;s my health on the line, why wouldn&#39;t I want that.Dude if you want better drugs to live longer. You have to have a profit incentive to push for better drugs. Taking that profit incentive away will kill all of us. Bernie is a socialist and his ideas need to die. That all I’m going to say.If we can take care of the healthcare problem without having to pay more in taxes im all for that. The minute you want me to start paying EVEN MORE taxes, that&#39;s when you lose my vote. I can barely pay for myself. I&#39;ll be damned if i&#39;m paying for other people on top of that.Half way in, poor follow up questions. Tuition is high for aa reason. Easy loans, inflated prices due to demand.  <br />Solution federal video bank of education videos, free to view. Hire the best professors and editors to create the library.  Take test to pass, alternate accreditation diploma.  Free online education is the only cost effective solution to that issue.Most comments is just WAHHHHH SOCIALISM. Not actually listening to what he saysMaximum wage? Anyone?Whether you agree with Sanders&#39; politics or not, he cares more about average Americans than any of the corporations currently pillaging the world.get jim carey onThe real reason the podcast went record/edit release.  Can&#39;t have political guests Live and have them saying something oppsie.I&#39;ve worked at amazon for over 2 years. While my bi weekly paychecks since the increase have in deed increased. I was immediately put into a higher tax bracket my take home pay remained almost the same. My monthly bonuses which averaged about $200- $300 are gone. And my yearly insensitives (RSU&#39;s) are gone. Please stop helping Bernie.Isn’t this dude a bit old to be running for president? 😂 you Americans crack me up man.Donald Trump, get Donald Trump on this podcast.Bernie2020!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Amazing to see the growth of Joe&#39;s podcast. His ability to sit and casually converse with some of the most influential people in the world is unprecedented and something to appreciate.Great ideas. Might be the one who changes the world. But. Fuuuck i hate his voice. 😂😂😂😂The powerful BernieWOOOOWWWWW I had to click on this instantly, good on you joe roganalex jones was right. the schills have got to him, Rogan in finally under the control of big platform media. Soron has officially got his hands onto Rogan I have on good information from people working in tech companies that YouTube has spoken to rogan regarding promoting left ideology a lot more in the lead up to the election. I guarantee trump wont be on jre, he would jumop at the chance however its not going to happen as that goes against the ethos of youtube, and mass media .i&#39;m a massive rogan fan I watch all his podcasts. Today is a sad day because another great podcaster and media influencer has died, he has coward to the $$$$$$$$$$$$ and threats that he has received to toe the line . Alex jones , shapiro , Peterson , gavin mcguinnes are the last of the mohicans . Notice he has had tulsi, Bernie, flogging beto O&#39;Rourke he throws Donald under the bus. the ideology that hes pushing is clear!!!!!!!!!!!U think this old communist is the answer??Drink everytime this soyboy says FREETulsi and Bernie ....and I&#39;ll vote demBernie is wrong about long-form conversation on television. TV is dying.Not a lot of eye contact going on here.Ah yes, the people will say govt intervention doesnt work while society is slowly collapsing before our eyes. Maybe intervention won’t work cause the govt is corrupt... and maybe Bernie isn’t corrupt because literally rich people refuse to donate to him unlike any other presidential candiateBernie 2020!Yeah, extreme income inequality is an issue. No authoritarian national socialism isn&#39;t a solution but a much worse problem. This career politician would sell us out to the CCP in one term.  Have some balls &amp; invite Steve Bannon on, or Thomas Sowell, Nikki Haley, Larry Elder, Gordon Chang, Kyle Bass, Dan Crenshaw, Candace Owens, Dennis Miller, Tucker Carlson or Victor Davis Hanson. Better yet, invite them all.Sell out Sanders!Holy shit.Booooooooooooo... what a waste of a show.Bernie, I gotta help ya; <br /><br /><br />inversion table , shave your head , go on TRT , become a savageU gotta be dumb to support Trump and hate BernieBUT WILL BERNIE DRINK AYUASCA OR DO DMT IS THE REAL QUESTION!!??do you feel the burn baby?I guess maga boys will be butthurt now. I am sure Joe Rogan would have Trump on if he&#39;d accept the invitation.What would Bernie do with a magic lance to help resolve our gun problem?The majority of comments are just saying Bernie is a communist/socialist for bringing healthcare/education to the same standard as the rest of western civilization.here goes joe for president of politics now.Bernie the soundbite king. Unbearable lies.RON PAUL 2020!😂👍All the dislikes came from little dick pink pussy in the face trump supporters. Online warriors irl peons .Joe rogan should do the debates in September.Don&#39;t like all his views and the fact he bent the knee to Hillary. Respect to both. thanks joe.I&#39;m center right, but it was refreshing to hear a long form interview like this with Bernie.what a freak show!!No profit ,,, no care ... sorry just the fact . People want to get paid . You s-end 10 or 12 years in college you want to get paid . Capitalism works if you want to work !!!The top 1% all donate to the DNC, look into itTen minutes in and Bernie just slides around every questionI can smell his organs decaying through the screen 😍😍😍They all copied Andrew Yang, Yang 2020!Low energy BerniePaying for universal healthcare with rich people&#39;s money is a fantasy. <br />Rich people are rich because they are smart, corporations make money because that&#39;s what they are designed to do. <br />Tax corporations and they will either close, leave the country or adjust there model to shift the cost to us the consumer.They are not just going to say &quot;okay, you&#39;re right I&#39;ll pay more&quot;.<br />Besides taxing the &quot;rich&quot; is just the sales pitch. The average middle class American will end up paying for it.Bernie is right about UK air time. It’s at a set time, normally 7pm and is 5 or 10 minutes long. All major parties get it and it announced beforehand that it’s a political advert. This is the <b>only</b> time it’s allowed. UK spending on campaigns is limited to £100,000 per candidate, though The Conservatives have been busted recently secretly spending more.Bring Bernie and Jordan Peterson on at the same timeClimate change....Bernie with the let&#39;s talk about health care reply to people think you want to take their money and you love dictatorships... bahahahThe bill for that heart surgery is not zero dollars you hack, it is 40-300$ a month for the rest of your life even if you never have that surgery.No wayyyyyyy!!!!!!!!! My two loves!!!! Holy shit!!!!Yoooooo how? Omg i gotta listen to this podcast after workHis voice gives me anxietyHoly fucking shit. This finally happened. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotMeUs">#NotMeUs</a>Really need Ron Paul now more than ever.Bernie is our only hope!🔥🥰Bernie “coco” sandersWhy is it legal to put your money where you want...because you own it.I’m sad joe during push his on the high school kids having jobs and minimum wage... young people can’t get jobs if they get paid same as older more mature peopleBernie no. Yang yes.the beginning of this show was literally Andrew Yangs closing in the second debate lol <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a>Holy shit!!!!!!!Social security checks garnished for delinquent school loans.....lol...talk about poor <a href="http://planning.lol/">planning.lol</a>.Feel the Bern of inferior economic thoughtOne, price fixing is not fucking good. Two, the countries that price fix use drugs and healthcare  that are developed in the USNo wayyy🤣🤣🤣🤣Bernie could only stay for an hour cus he has to pee, knowing that&#39;s going to take another hour. Man has a tight schedule.Bernie is a fraud.The problem is,  Bernie is apart of the establishment!!! He very wealth and owns a sports car and multiple home!! Hello!! He&#39;s  been in office for a very long time.  I can&#39;t trust him with a 10 foot stick.Think he can land Trump?There is no such thing as a democratic socialist.  Because there is nothing democratic about socialism.His body language suggests that he knows he is only highlighting a small portion of the story, and purposefully leaving out major details that would blow his arguments apart. He knows he&#39;s not right.Bernie “not so sexy for the media” sandersNo you didnt..... No dude nooooooHoly ***, real Bernie Sanders? Joe Rogan is getting more and more influential.TRUMP 2020...fuck socialismJoe make him smoke so weedThis man will be a legend one day.Omg!!! Joe rogan is officially the best podcast in the 🌎Bernie the bumhole sanders , great guest,The only thing i agree is that big pharma rules the market. everything else is still a joke from bernie. FYI communism/socialism will always fail.blah blah blah statistics and the .5%, 1% and 2%   parerto distributrion approx the square of USA population at 360 mil    60 million people do half the work /production/wealth  HE is trying to go against  statistical math and nature even uses in it distribution (or am I just a Peterson Cuck ?)But white people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor .amazingAs a Mexican, Trump-Supporting, Veteran I ponder... Your ideas are not bad. Just unrealistic. America is unique and will never work under these other countries strategies (socialism). No country is like ours...Bernie going ASMR on us. LolGenuine question about Bernie&#39;s policies.  So he has said things like he will not deport people that over stay their Visas, advocates for decriminalize illegal border crossings and would minimize ICE. He is also giving illegal immigrants free Healthcare.  Will that not incentivize people to come here illegally demanding taxpayer funded benefits making an unsustainable situation?His honeymoon in Moscow in the 80s is quite telling as hes there with military officers drinking praising a communist country which paid for him, that failed a few years later like every other socialist attempt. Hes a soviet agent and his hollow communist policies are only meant to destroy the progress and superiority of the US. Hes a foreign agent but the dems are all compromised with corporate money meant to capitalize on the Chinese market to the detriment of America. Hes an evil enigma puppet wrapped up in a harmless old man but his masters know exactly what they are doing.People will always &#39;need&#39; shit. At what point do you stop and tell them to sort their own lives out instead of taking money off other people to support them?Remember kids, conservatives are so smart, they think video games and not praying in school is what&#39;s wrong with America. Vote R, because the R is for...Really interested to hear what he says and then he disappoints me after 10 minutes by saying he &quot;COULD care less&quot; about something....I don&#39;t know if I can get over that- he&#39;s really let himself down....Joe get Trump on the show,If Joe doesn&#39;t call Bernie out on his posture I&#39;m done.Legend has it, we&#39;re still waiting to see how to pay for his plan. He avoids saying tax the middle class.Glad to see a lot of conservatives giving him a shot in the comment section! Respectgod damn, get Ron Paul on nextOnly an hour long? Must have been a weak podcast.<br />(I&#39;ll update this as I watch it,)I&#39;d rather see a electoral debate on the JRE show that mainstream tvIt would be HILARIOUS if Cocaine Mitch would come on just cause Bernie called him out!Im from Canada. The E.R. in my home town is closed for sometimes over a month at a time bc of a shortage of doctors. FREE HEALTHCARE!Fuccck this guyAndrew Yang’s freedom dividend of $1000 a month to all citizens would kick start the economy and help unemployed workers and stay at home parents. Bernie’s $15/hr would force small businesses to cut hours and fire workers they can’t afford to keep and do nothing for the 40% of Americans who aren’t in the work forceThanks for having him on joe! It was great to see how out of touch he is in regards to his policies.I love JRE.....so I&#39;m gonna do my best to listen with a open mind<br /><br /><br /><br />.......until he talks about gun control...The problem with the economic system is &quot;Financialization&quot;. Layers upon layers of shell companies to stash away customer money to tax havens. Read about it people.So we have comrade Sanders. I’ll give this a listen out of curiosity.BERNIE!!!Serious comment: I’ve never, ever, heard Bernie not yell until this video.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=34m41s">34:41</a> <b>Error Bernie.exe has stopped working</b>Joe Rogan marketing agencyThey call Trump a Nazi when Nazi literally translates to National SOCIALIST!! 😂😂😂<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SethRich">#SethRich</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23neverforget">#neverforget</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Q">#Q</a>Starvation and genocide.Get Elizabeth WarrenFuck Wall street , fuck big pharma , they need to pay their fair share, Bernie 2020 with Tulsi as Vice PresidentI&#39;m 7 minutes in and his delusions have me baffled that he gets air timeNot a fan of Bernie but It&#39;ll be interesting to see him actually have a conversation and explain his view more.Rogan is imo the greatest interviewer in the world right nowComrade Bernie is fucking insane.I love how open minded people are being in the comments.Only an hour, step it up Bernie.Lol Bernie is in the top 1% and he doesnt realise it, what a hypocrite<br />No offence Joe but you really dropped the ball on this interview.<br />Bernie has a conversation about minimum wage while refusing to pay his own staff a living wage and when they force the issue he cuts their hours.<br />You need to do better Joe because this was up there with your original Jack Dorcey interview.This guys like a gift and a curse to me wants to ban guns but legalize marijuanaBernie 2020Don’t understand how free healthcare and college is a problem someone help me understand most kids are going to a shitty community college and is being charged thousands of dollars for a semester.We all need to watch this with an open mind. Put the partisan bull to the side.They should switch it and provide the tax incentives to these companies when they come out with drugs in areas that aren&#39;t very profitable. This way the company still makes money on normal products they create meanwhile put more effort into research that benefits all in return for tax credits. There is so many areas they could easily move forward but they wont bother today just because of future $$. You&#39;d think they would want the positive publicity from something like that as well.It happened!!WoooooooowEveryone needs to vote for this man he is our only hope !!!!So many dislikes from republicans before they even listen to the podcast!  Republicans proving more and more how close minded they are.Ended before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m20s">4:20</a> dame itDo people really think that the DNC will let him in after what they did last time? I&#39;m voting Trump, the party of slavery and segregation will never get my vote.Bernie ”I believe healthcare is a right”<br />Joe ”have you ever heard of DMT?”Oh fuck this is going to be weird.There&#39;s no more dangerous creature to liberty than someone who thinks they&#39;re doing you a favor and that you just don&#39;t know what&#39;s good for you.Lets get this to 10million“When I was poor and complained about inequality they said I was bitter; now that I&#39;m rich and I complain about inequality they say I&#39;m a hypocrite. I&#39;m beginning to think they just don&#39;t want to talk about inequality.” <br /><br />A Russell Brand quote yes, but point to this when anyone ever mentions Bernie’s wealth.What&#39;s up with all the &quot;I&#39;m a conservative but I&#39;ll listen&quot; are you serious? This is the guy who attacked hillary more than trump last election, and ended up joining her team when they didnt let him debate the primary. Paid shills pretending to be conservatives, all real conservatives know this guy is an anti white anti-semite socialist freakThe snake oil salesman at his finest. Bernie needs to go away, so I&#39;m glad rogan had him on to let people listen to his nonsense.He’s a very nice guy and all his ideas are very nice, but his plans just aren’t going to work and are too radical. Prefer Tulsi and Yang.Why do all of Sanders ideas involve giving the government for power?I believe Medical innovation would suffer greatly under Bernie. I just simply disagree with his philosophies. That being said I love that you had him on for a long form conversation. I would like it if all politicians were required to do this.Trump on Rogan in 2024 is going to be incredibleHere comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus... Screw Bernie...<br /><br />Trump 2020Good luck finding a doctor in Canada. I waited 6 monthsDude i had no idea he was a librarian or whateverIt&#39;s good to see a fair chance to explain his viewpoints and it did help me understand his arguments more.. but this solidified my choice to not vote for him.Bernie &quot;yuman right healthcare healthcare healthcare &quot; Sanders.I&#39;m here for the laughs!Classic Bernie pose for the thumbnailHonestly think Sanders is a tool. But because he came on JRE I’m willing to listen. I give him props for this.Wow I’m impressed with the comments, guess it shows how Bernie is a genuine human unlike some of the leftist that have come on this show. Love the love for freedom of views and conversations!whahaha this dude will never be president <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=24m50s">24:50</a>I hope this lame stream goes down as the least watch stream ever on This channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FuckYouBernieSanders">#FuckYouBernieSanders</a>We needed Eddie Bravo on this podcast tooRIP Ross PerrotBernie has never worked in the free market......ever.The new Oprah.I work in the insurance industry.

Minutes later....the debate is over.Bernie actually brings up some good points. Very surprising<br /><br /><br />However he barely makes eye contact with Joe.I&#39;m gonna go tweet and rant about how jealous I am for not being invited to Joe Rogan show.Shekels make shackles:)WE NEED DONALD J. TRUMP ON JREI hope he starts yelling at Joe like he does to voters.Bernie: joe do you know how much tuition cost in the 50&#39;s<br />Joe: no, how much? <br />Bernie: im not entirely sure... practically free<br />Joe: whats it at now<br />Bernie: i dont know but its alot....<br /><br /><br />Bernie has no idea what hes talking about.Political shill Rogan at it again.Canadian Conservative but definitely giving this a listen. It&#39;s always good to try and understand the other sides point of views on these topics.Bernie &quot;We only have 12 years left&quot; SandersIt turns out Kyle Kulinski had a lot to do with making this happen.Bernie just started paying his people 15 bucks an hour and he had to cut hours. Can&#39;t even manage a campaign and he wants to be president?Yoooooooooeetrading stocks tax is 37.5% thats what you&#39;re taxed at the end of the year. that is not modestima guess and say they not goingt to smoke with me . lolllAhhhh!!!! Its on!!! I&#39;m not pro Bernie whatsoever but am just so curious to hear him not rallying and sitting down with Joe Rogan of all people!!!Noam Chomsky please before he dies.Nope - I tried - but no way can I listen to this mental communist cunt!So here is where he loses me on minimum wage. I just got back from Seattle where minimum wage is much higher than Florida but damn it was expensive as hell. Everything was more expensive.  Cost of living was ridiculous.  <br /><br />Flipping burgers should not be a career. We need more jobs. We need to lead the world in new technology.  <br /><br />Andrew Yang freedom dividend seems a little smarter... this helps everyone. Over night flipping burgers gets you paid the same as an EMTWhy does Joe never challenge his guests ideals unless when it comes to weed. Joe, you’ve spent so many podcasts seeming like you strongly disagree with Bernie, don’t act like you’re supportive of him and his ideals so easily in this one.Amazon got around your bullying by reducing full time positions. . .TRUMP 2020! But ill still give Bernie a chance and listen to his words. Thats the difference between the right and the left.MAGA 2020Democratic socialism= some rich people may bear  the burden<br />Libertarianism= most working people do bear the burdenThey both don&#39;t understand the word &quot;free.&quot; There is no such thing as &quot;free healthcare&quot; or &quot;free education.YESSSS finally!!You can’t look to World War I or II to fight current wars.<br /><br />You can’t look at medicine from the 50s to create advantages in today’s new technological world.<br /><br /><br />My only issue with Bernie is on healthcare he constantly says “Look, this and that president did it” and NO one presses him on “HOW WOULD YOU DO YOUR HEALTHCARE AS A RIGHT?!?” <br /><br />He never answers. He reverts to he did she did. What are YOU going to do and how? <br /><br />I never hear an answer on universal healthcare. Like the implementation. Never. Bugs me. Other than that, he’s aiight for the demsBernie moaning about millionaires having influence in politics whilst being a millionaire politition 🙃Bernie Sanders/Tulsi Gabbard 2020<br />About Face: Veterans Against the War<br />Formerly Iraq Veterans Against the War<br /><a href="http://aboutfaceveterans.org/">AboutFaceVeterans.org</a>$400,000 in debt if you are a surgeon is nothing. If you don’t blow all your money when you start getting paid you can pay that off in a couple years. Harder for a typical person to pay off $50,000.I’ve been waiting for this for fucking years!!!!!! Years son!!!Only an hour and seven minutes... time to find out why.He’s got my voteHow awesome is this!The dnc stoke the last election from you. Why cuck, Bernie?Shouldn’t this be on mma showThe only positive about trump is that he has money he didn’t have to be bought out like every president. But socialism doesn’t work whatsoever. Free this free that, sounds great but nothing is freeI don&#39;t think anyone who is pushing the socialist liberal agenda should get any attention.  It&#39;s all lies n bullshit so you just promote bullshit. You can hide behind giving both sides a chance but why bother when you know what they stand for is not the right direction for this country. It is not a matter of opinion when it&#39;s a matter of fact. You worked hard to get your success Joe so you think taking that away by giving everyone free shit is the right direction?  You want good pay n benifits you work for it period. I worked all my life and before Obamacare I could afford to go to the doctor now it has allowed corporations to give shitty insurance and charge employees for it.  I now have to spend 5000 bucks out of pocket before my insurance pays anything. Obama, liberalism,  socialism is destroying this country and you effin know it joe. You get what you work for.Good job Joe you&#39;re actually starting to allow people with intellectual Concepts on your show no I&#39;m bought and paid for right-wingers when I want to do a 50/50 spread that way you Enlighten both sidesGrandpa Lenin is at it againMade it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=5m57s">5:57</a> before Bernie told his first whopping lie regarding Canadian healthcare. And that was after lying about healthcare bejng a right. Stopped watching.Jesus it&#39;s Bernie. Does he get stoned?Who the heck is this? Why did Tony Henchcliff cancel?!?WTF? Bernie Sanders?!<br /><br />I LOVE JRE but idk if I can tolerate this. I’ll try, I’ll give it a shot.did he live till the end?THANK YOU JOE ROGAN!RIGHT ON!!!!!I don’t agree with Bernie, but if you listen to him speak, he’s actually a pretty smart individual. <br /><br />Everybody only sees the 5 second clips of Bernie or Trump saying stuff out of context but if people would sit down and listen to either of them speak.. I bet they would be more open minded to the other side. <br /><br />Well done Joe, great podcast.Here we gooo3 min in and I gotta say much respect for Bernie calling out media . I&#39;m not a Bernie fan but Joe just brings the best out in peopleBernie is like rowdy rod Piper from &quot;they live&quot; and everyone is calling him crazy for calling out US oligarchsGET TRUMP ON!!!!!Ok, 1/4 way through &amp; talking about minimum wage, his answer is well off All the competition has to pay $15 then it’s a level playing field... um NO!  You do realize that they are going to pass that cost on to US the consumer or automate or cut hours &amp; numbers of employees!!  JUST LIKE YOU DID TO YOUR STAFF BERNIE !!!The instant dislike crew came full swingAMERICAS DAD!Joe get Martin Shkreli onyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssss!!!!!! GO BERNIE!!!!!! Why so short thou?I&#39;d like it if Ben Shapiro were there to raise the B.S. flag.Trying to sell socialism is akin to Jim Jones selling the Kool Aid.Who else feels fucked by student loans?!Love all the positive comments! Great episode ✊I&#39;m a Ron Paul Libertarian but this guy is the best shot we have to get an honest, consistent human being in the white house. I truly beleive he will fight against the insurance companies, wall street banks, big pharma, oil giants.. he has been doing it for decades. The guy got &quot;big Irish balls&quot;ahahah fuck you trump tards!!!!!!!!!!!!!Damn he’s a hop and skip away from getting Obama on the podcastNotice how in these comments it’s the conservatives and libertarians who have an open mind? I’m sorry but you never see this with liberals. It’s a testament to the confidence we have in our beliefs. We don’t need to denounce or hate on people with different viewpoints.I just got off work and this is exactly what I needed.I am glad to see all the right wingers in the comments saying they will listen.  It&#39;s the first step to recovering from the conservative cult.We need the economic policies of Bernie Sanders with the immigration policies of Donald Trump during his campaign.Ooooh. Noooooo Unsubscribing as we speakomg alex jones is gonna break up with rogan again and start crying about how  he is a racist inside trading  CIA agent until he gets back on the podcastRemember when those 2 blacks chics backed him down off his own mic on his stage and took over. Lol.Sure, I&#39;ll listen to, <b>&quot;Let&#39;s grow the federal government, comrades&quot;</b> , for an hour.The millionaire socialist Bernie Sanders who got setup to lose by the DNC and never said a word about it. He&#39;s a fraud .Is Joe gonna offer Bernie a blunt?BERNIE 2020!!!!✊✊✊✊Raising the minimum wage only jumpstarts inflation. Then $15 an hour is the new $7.25 sophomore level economics 🙄Bernie just became the leader in pollsCity University of New York &quot;CUNY&quot; was once considered the Ivy league of free higher education.Lol this is awesome! You should totally interview the President next! Trump 2020!If you’re unsuccessful in life and are jealous of successful people, then vote Bernie Sanders so you get more money for being a failure.Tulsi and Yang are the only 2 Dems I trust but seeing Bernie here is cool.Lmao if Joe gets Trump on the air ILL VOTE.Get Trump on!!!BIG BERNIE BOOLING IN THE BANDO.Why isn&#39;t joe questioning his rhetoric? This is jack dorsey all over again lmaoJoe &quot;Softball&quot; RoganRegardless of ur view u gotta admit this is a great interviewi dont know what the fuck i am politically but man do i get excited when joe has a political guest on. so mind opening every timeI  wonder if joe passed the bong 🤔A government big enough to give you everything you want, is also just big enough to take everything you have.Awesome, Joe Rogan finally interviewed his real dadClimate change is a Trojan horse for socialism.Guarantee money for big pharma! Let&#39;s run medical care like the DMV! 65 yr olds are made comfortable while left to die in hospitals, why can&#39;t we treat 35 yr olds with exactly that same treatment?!JRE #1776 - Donald TrumpPut some Republicans on the podcast to nice to hear Bern tho I know nothing about himMan, it&#39;s surreal watching Rogan go from what was essentially a very niche Podcast for fighters and stoners, to what is essentially a gigantic media platform that shapes and drives the narratives of scientific research and political discourse.<br /><br />Good for you Joe, I&#39;m glad I was with you from the start.Bernie Sanders: &quot;The problem is money and billionaires...&quot;<br />Also Bernie: &quot;I live in mansions and expect others to pay my salary...&quot;Deluded guy, has got no chance.This might honestly be the fucking smartest decision Bernie has ever made.Canadian healthcare sucks. I’ve had many experiences in American and Canadian ER’s and I’ll take America’s any day. Efficiency, attitude, everything’s better BECAUSE you pay the pretty penny. I’m not super well off but when it comes to my well-being it’s worth itNext step donald trump.Nice old guy, what division in the WWE was he, or was this before the weight classesBernie Sanders......Joe Rogan......HERE WE GO!!!!!Minimum wage is over 11.00/hr in my state right now. New York State. It’s 15.00 in nyc. Needs to be at least thatvin this stateJoe really is the Chosen One, wholly crap, what if we are in Joe&#39;s simulationDoes he realize it takes weeks, if not months, to get k to a doctor in the major cities of Canada?  This guy skims a book and considers himself an expert on the subject.yaaaaaay more free stuff !!!!Joe&#39;s conservative comment section is gonna be throwing a fit about this lol. As a New Zealander I still struggle to understand the concept of medical bills being a thing you guys deal with. And not having 4 weeks of guaranteed paid vacation. If these things make NZ a hellhole I&#39;m glad to live in the hellhole 😁1 hour?!I&#39;m here for da commentsBernie is such a grade A prick.Bernie mutherfocking Sanders.......oh my!Good podcast but I&#39;m still voting for Trump 😄Do trump next.  Have a podcast with him to see his human side.Bernie &quot;crooks in wall street &quot; SandersDon&#39;t fall through left and right paradigmBernie Sanders 2020! <br />People over profits!!!<br /><br />Big Pharma are NOT making cures they want repeat business.<br />In 2nd Amendment it states  &quot;well regulated &quot;!<br />My man Bernie need to try our Cali Kush😉Bernie Sanders and most white Democrats want to globalize this country to eradicate the white race and turn America into a welfare state.Lol  Bernie trying to talk about minimum wage when he wouldnt even pay is own staff 15$ an hour then he did and cut there hoursI don’t trust Berniewhat do you think is going to happen to the cost of consumer goods if people are paid 15/hr instead of 10?  if people want to make more than the minimum wage, get the skills for a better job, or start your own business.  one should not be entitled to a fair life.  since when was life ever fair?!  if bernie thinks 15 is fair, why doenst he pay his own staff that?  theyre in open revolt by exposing this!   what a hypocrite....Yeahhhhh, I don&#39;t listen to socialists. Get Trump on here.Does anyone really think that the DNC will let public enemy no. 1 - an old white male (even though he blabs about being an ‘ally’) anywhere near the nomination? Sorry Bernie but you helped usher in this era of toxic identity politics.I can&#39;t listen to this commie blabber about nonsense. Out at 24 minutes.All Bernie needs to do is livestream a meme review to get us zoomers to vote for him.Everyone already commenting about how terrible Bernie is--despite the fact that this video was uploaded half an hour ago and is an hour long--is a testament to how close-minded people are. At least listen to the whole damn thing before commenting you fucking weebsI live in Canada, the bill is not $0 it&#39;s half of everything I make for my entire life. it makes me angry every time I hear Canadian healthcare is &quot;free&quot;. We spend &quot;half&quot; as much per capita because we are regularly denied health treatments when it doesn&#39;t fit the cost/benefit calculation the government does on you. GTFOH with that bolognaHow many of these comments are gonna be conservatives virtue signalling the fact they can hear a different viewpoint without imploding?This conversation will make history. All of the current and future candidates will need to be open to have a CONVERSATION like this, with someone who will ask the real questions, and not just give a prepared  speech..From now on I am waiting for Trump in this podcast!Democratic socialism is an absolute joke. There is a reason why people from Cuba and Latin America tend to vote Republican( don&#39;t get me wrong there an absolute joke just like the liberals) There is no perfect form of government but true market capitalism is the best option I have seen so far. The problem is is we&#39;re dealing with true crony capitalism right now.Bernie the bozo! xDThat&#39;s exactly what Yang called it.Tulsi/Bernie, Bernie/Tulsi 2020!He keeps clearing the bullshit out of his throatThis actually happened right? This is real? Well damnBernie = selloutHe doesn’t know the difference between a rifle and a assault weapon lolOne of the problems I have with Bernie not that I think trumps morals or manners are anything good 😂. When Bernie says free, what is free? Nothing is free, socialism is a romantic idea that doesn’t work. It just doesn’t.Did he apologize for shooting Steve Scalise?To think a lot of Millennials loved this guy. Makes you think what are they teaching in schools, up to college? Obviously not free thinking.Every Presidential candidate should be required to make an appearance on JRE. I&#39;d say it&#39;s actually in their best interest! Pull that up Jaime.joe you being a toe again? why cant you press for those whom have no voice?Bernie! Joe! Love this!Micheal Jordan Anderson Silva Ali Floyd huuuh Joe the Goat Rogan dont at memoney = power...power must be limited...simple concept....that&#39;s actually the best reason to have a high tax bracket for the extremely richTulsi Gabbard commercial before Bernie 😂It&#39;s Bernie or Trump.Let&#39;s try out this. Put fox News hosts at McDonald&#39;s for the minimum wage. They would vote for Bernie in a heartbeat.awesome joe. awesome awesome awesome awesome. btw im a conservative trump voterReally want him to beat biden because biden doesn&#39;t stand a chance.Don&#39;t fall for the BSDamn Bernie I was rooting for you. However, I disagreed with 90% of what you were saying. It seems you love to talk about the top 1% which is of little concern to me, it seems to be emotional wording to get poor people riled up. I am a small business owner, I&#39;m not Amazon or Mcdonalds, overpaying people for simple jobs would put a strain on not only my business but other hard working small business owners. Missed opportunity buddy.WOAH WOAH WOAH!!!!!!!!take a shot every time bernie clears his throatI just cum here to unlike this bullshitdamn 2K dislikes already. rogan really got people sperging out over this one.I am happy to see he has Bernie on. I won&#39;t agree with Bernie on much besides the fact that there are some things he correctly identifies as issues, but doesn&#39;t quite get the prescription correct. Big banks, some corporations, and others have indeed skated many many times while the middle class has been strained to the brink (now).<br /><br /><br />I do believe he is a man of the people, but I will never be able to get behind his socialist view of things.Ok everybody settle down I had to say that, come on!Hes really gonna sit there and say the quality of health care is as good in canadaIf every candidate for 2020 (including Trump) could come on this show, or at least participate in a platform like this, I would be happyHoley shit, I can&#39;t believe Joe got Larry David on, so fucking hilarious.What the hell does Bernie think the rich corporations do with the money they earn? They reinvest it into the market.<br />They expand their business and create new jobs. Sure they have a few extra cars and houses but so does Bernie.<br />Socialism is not the answer.Amazing that he brings people from both sides like Ben Shapiro, Steven crowder, then people like Tulsi, and sanders.I-... I-... A heads up would be nice. I am speechless. Last thing I was expecting. I need a minute.America Will NEVER Be A Socialist Country! This man (Sanders) said &quot;When people have to stand in lines for food,that is a GOOD thing.damn 2K dislikes already. rogan really got people sperging out over this one.Social Security is not a rigght it is an entitlement people pay into .  It not Welfare  ... !!!!Lol I’ve never heard him not shouting. It’s kinda weird to hear him just talking. Good though.Why doesnt Bernie look Joe in the eyes when he&#39;s talking to himDamn, Can&#39;t wait to listen to this tomorrow!!Nooo fucking way!!!!!! Bernie on JRE &lt;3 keen as a beanIf andrew yang aint gonna win, u got my vote BernieThis is awesome!Socialism is slavery.......Look into itWhere’s the “Joe Rogan is an alt right gateway all he does is have conservatives on and agree with them” crowd now? He has all types of people on and he always has since the beginning.It&#39;s amazing that out of all candidates, Bernie Sanders is the one who understands the reach Joe Rogan has. Take my vote cool grandpaFUCK ALL BRAINWASHED REPUBLICANS FOX NEWS IS PROPAGANDA ABORTIONS ARENT KILLING CHILDREN  FUCK TRUMP DOWN WITH THE GOP THEY ARE EVILLibertarians &amp; Progressives Unite for Bernie Sanders / Tulsi Gabbard 2020If a serious presidential candidate comes on the Jre they should have to do no less than three hours. One hour is chicken shitI love Bernie Sanders, he&#39;s the only one of the top candidates who hasn&#39;t sold us out.This guy is a clown and Joe is starting to become a joke.ohhhhs hoot, buckle up cocksucka&#39;s. If ol man bernie hits the bong he will have my voteAfter watching the first few minutes, I&#39;m convinced Bernie doesn&#39;t actually want to be President. This is not the demeanor of someone trying to win. This is a very old man who is very tired.I&#39;m a wizard but I&#39;ll still give it a chance.What&#39;s this actually live?This peice of shit CALLS TRUMP A WHITE SUPREMACIST WITH NO EVEIDENCE, WHY IS HE ON THIS SHOW?Bernie got 3 beach houses.Joe is not bias with the people he interviews, Burnie is one of the most important sit down&#39;s in are time Bernie is the man that will lead the people to a forward moving society for are future... Bernie 2020 vision <a href="http://usnot.me/">UsNot.Me</a> for the win. ;) 8) :o)  So glad you got Bernie while he was in cali.no fucking way!Oh yea feel the bern baby!Joe ‘Elk’ Rogan with Bernard Sanders- This should be interestingSee Burnie fail number #569495384. You can&#39;t fucking raise minimum wage without fucking up everything else.. Rent prices will increase and the cost of food and other goods will go up so those businesses can afford the increase in labor costs. So raising the minimum wage all it does is make prices go up. So  you never actually get ahead. It has other consequences too because if a dishwasher gets $15 /hr then a cook doesn&#39;t want 15 too he wants far more than the shitty dishwasher so its a price wage increase all across the board. Then businesses become more picky on who they hire. So you will increase the unemployment numbers because those people cant even get the baseline shitty jobs because the companies who normally would hire them has become more discriminating.&lt;3Complains about lack of time on commercial TV, does the shortest Joe Rogan podcast ever.2016 was Bernie&#39;s time. They fucked him, and then he cucked to them.Actually, Bernie, the drug companies are not researching Alzheimer&#39;s drugs. There are only 70 in the entire pipeline for Alz and 1100 for Cancer. Eli-Lily - pulled the plug on the only Alzheimer&#39;s drug they were doing trials.Thank you Joe for having Bernie on, and thank you for letting him talk most of the time. I only wish it were longer.&quot;Not me, US.&quot; <br /><br />Bernie 2020Wow! Joe actually was able to get Bernie on here!Other countries spend less on healthcare per capita because almost all of the medical advancements, treatments, research and new drugs come from the United States.Bernie&#39;s wrong about a lot of things but I&#39;m glad he did this.Can’t make it on $12/13 an hour? Dude Bernie hate to break it to ya bud but most people making that are happy because most people are working for $8.75- 9.50 an hr in the MidwestOnly one hour?🤔If healthcare is a human right, why are you only trying to provide free healthcare to only Americans? And if it is a human right, why does that mean by definition that it should be free? Is food a human right? Should that be free? What about shelter? Should all houses be govt funded?Haven’t watched yet, but I REALLY hope Burnie smokes a doobie with joeAmazing to see actual public discourse with the leaders of our country. Much respect to these two influential men sitting down and exchanging ideas. Joe has given a long form voice to multiple candidates.<a href="http://berniesanders.com/">berniesanders.com</a><br />Bernie beats Trump!<br />Med4All <br />Volunteer, Donate, Vote!<br />🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦Joe get Jeremy Wade from River Monsters he has a new show out to promote.Thank you 🙏 Mr Rogan for continuing to produce these podcasts.He&#39;s so full of shit<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m53s">23:53</a> &quot;and in some cases to the democratic party&quot; wow... seriously, just wow. This man is either blind or a liar. Likely both. Look at silicon valley alone. Who the hell do you think all of them donate to? Absolutely ridiculous.I doubt i&#39;m gonna be able to watch this baffoonTrump will win in 2020 <br />Liberals don&#39;t have a good candidates <br />Their only hope old man commie Bernie Sanders and creepy pedo joe BidenYOUR A BUM BERNIE! GET A JOB YOU JEW BASTARD!Bernie: Before you ask Joe, I&#39;m currently on a healthy dose of DMTOn this day we are blessed, for this will spawn a thousand memes.Are there different kinds of Insulin?  I know for a fact you can buy a vile of it for $25 at Wal M<br />art? How cheap is it suppose to be?I love Bernie so much.I&#39;m surprised old man leftist didn&#39;t get the comments censored.The people&#39;s champ on jre 🔥🔥🔥Hell yea, hope this man becomes presidentMy favorite part @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m05s">0:05</a> that voiceThis is crazy! Joe you&#39;ve made it !I enjoyed this, props to joe for giving all sides a place to speak their views! TRUMP 2020!!An A+ podcast with an A+ candidate. Nuff said.30 min and already beat fighter and the kid in views.My notification said joe rogan &amp; bernie sanders. The name sanders rang a bell, i was intrigued to have a look. Sorry but after 1min i’ve seen enough. Respect for joe to invite the man but sorry don’t you think he should be retired. Look towards your neighbour and get somebody young like canada or as in New Zealand a young mum. The whole American system is out of date. Half the lot should be fired and the other lot should do the work they have to do. They all seem to be out there for themselves. Trump did it for fun, barack was the right tool at the time. You need someone young &amp; bright...Joe!!! We love you!False the reason college went cost went up was because the government stuck their nose in it.Funny how he doesn’t mention how you underpaid his own staff and had to cut their hours and then fire them for trying to form a union come on Joe asked the real questions don’t pussy outI&#39;m waiting for the T(rump) to arrive at the J(oe Rogan).No fucking way...😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 I was NOT expecting this! But I’m happy!I wanted to listen to this, but I stuck my fingers in my ears and yelled Socialist, while crying like a bitch for 70 min.Trump 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸is trump going to come on to talk about wall street and saudi arabia?  XDI hope in the near future these traditional debates become obsolete and these longer format discussions become the norm. Thanks for this. I want him or Yang to run against Trump.I’ve waited so long!!!! I’ve wanted this so badly!!! Yes! Yes!Fuck yeah! Big props to both of these two for doing this! No matter your views, can&#39;t deny this is progress for american politics and long form discussionDeath is a preferable alternative to communism.Nowaaaaay it&#39;s lit!!!Every problem in the world: ....<br />Bernie Sanders: “The government can fix it! Cause you know... the government fixes everything with no waste”Bernie 2020!!!It&#39;d be interesting to have a current or former board member of the NRA on the podcast. Someone like Tom Selleck or Pete Brownell.Please joe, get him hi.Hot damn JoeJoe is the podcast GOAT. CHANGE MY MINDI&#39;ll swerve this oneFEDERAL RESERVE  THE BOOGEYMAN THE LEFT CANT MENTIONWhy are the bots stating they&#39;re Right Wing and somehow feel confortsble to listen to this?!Joe Biden should also come on Joes podcast! Thats real conversation... no media noice and manipulation... if he is smart he&#39;ll do itThe comment section seems to be filled with people who want to brag about how open-minded they are for watching a Bernie Sanders interview.Fuck this socialist piece of shit...Dumbest old fuck out thereJoe should get Trump and Bernie on there to debateHoly shit he actually got a big politician on hereJoe please get Trump on the showCould Rogan land Trump on the show? Would it boil down to Joe kicking Trump’s ass?this guy should just go to a failed state, instead of making the US oneOnly in America is giving people healthcare and education is a net negative on society. The country is fuckedI really love this format for political discussion. Even 25 mins in, I feel like I understand Bernie a lot more than I previously did. I still disagree with a shitload of things he says, but understanding is important.Each candidate should be on the JRE. Make it happen Joe.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Body language reminds me of a toad.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a>  we dont need better daycares, we need mothers taking care of their own kids while fathers have their authority over the family restored, and come back in the home.  end family court favoritism of gynocentric policies, and get women out of the work force.  restore the cost of labor to what it was before feminism.  fuck the oligarchs.  bernie is a feminist, fuck that shit.Bernie 2020...How can you have &quot;Healthcare as a human right&quot; while at the same time having liberty as a human right?<br /><br />In other words, to guarantee your right to healthcare you need to make someone work for you (a doctor); you may argue that this doctor is being paid, but it&#39;s done so by the labour of the taxpayers. Therefore, taxpayers are working for you. This can be called indirect slavery? Yes. Don&#39;t get me wrong, this system is much more benevolent than previous slavery systems, but, in principle, is the same.<br /><br />And I&#39;m not even arguing against &quot;the right to healthcare&quot;, I&#39;m just pointing a contradiction. You can&#39;t ensure the right to healthcare while at the same time ensuring the right to liberty and the fruits of your labour. At least not in an honest manner.<br /><br />Maybe the right to liberty shouldn&#39;t be respected in full, I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s for some other day.WHAT! BERNIE?!? NICE<br /><br />Also 2k likes? I thought you guys were smarter than that.Apparently hes never heard of cspan 1 or 2 or pbsSo happy to see the comments filled with opposing views coming together  and loving free speech! &lt;3Yes, yes, YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!Ideas are all fine and dandy...until the rubber meets the road. What Bernie never addresses (while saying &quot;other countries do it&quot;), is that because medicare was implemented, everyone else in America had to pay for it. It opened the door for easy manipulation.<br />I ask you, if the government came to you and said &quot;hey, I know you make 20.00 per hour when you work, but from here on out, 30% of the jobs you do, you will only be paid 15.00, if you don&#39;t like it, tough t***y said the kitty.<br />I appreciate ideas presented in calm voices, but i don&#39;t appreciate dishonesty, especially when it completely ignores the realities of previous policy.I&#39;m an open mind but I will listen to this with a conservativeHonest question you need to ask yourself. Where are you going to really going to get to know a candidate? 1. A quick 10 minute segment on mainstream media with loaded questions and skewed framing of subjects engineered toward bias? 2. A long form podcast with a regular joe? ....this format is and will be the future10 minutes in: medicine in Canada for 1/10th the price?! Put him in the Trump administration! Sorry not voting for socialism. He can do that 1 good thing as a subordinate. Only question is, who&#39;s footing the bill?He&#39;s only here because this is what the young cool kids are watchingTeachers arent underpaid! lmao so sick of that shit. In CA they make around 80K a year. Oh wait, they get 3 months off too. So 80K in 9 months. Most teachers ive spoken with arent complaining about the wages. Its the school systems and funding etc.The Bernie ASMR video nobody knew they needed!Ok... Why does Bernie always say “we” when asked a question about his individual singular self and the actions he will take as POTUS? <br />Who is “We”, Bernie?Hey Joe, any reason why you were dead silent about the El Paso shooter but went into a retweet fury after it was found the Ohio shooter a self-acclaimed leftist?Joe rogan is a cuckBernie is full of shitCan&#39;t say I expected thisbernieiswrong comOh my god. I cannot believe he got Bernie on here.Awww the sad sad conservatives are triggered by Bernie Sanders, sad face. Edit:  Yes! Triggered conservatives in the replies, my day is done. I have such a huge smile on my face.No, raising the minimum wage does not affect every business equally. If you have a giant operating margin (big firm) it&#39;s way easier to absorb than if you are a small company.Holy shit<b>cheat sheet</b> Canader =CanadaTRUMP FOR 2020 but you still can talkJOE GOING FULL SOCIALIST, JRE IS OVER.I can&#39;t believe  that he got Bernie  that pretty coolJust came in long enough to say I can&#39;t. I just can&#39;tWaiting for joe to ask Bernie about how clinton bought the dnc/democratic nomination and stole it from him, and why he still backed Clinton after he discovered he got screwed? Timestamp pleaseGive a rogans down to this episodelmao the dislikes, feel the burn bitchHe won my voteBernie!!!!!!!!!!!Tax funded health care is great. Many of us in the world have it and none want to change. No one ever goes bankrupt from seeking healthcare and no one is ever refused care. From what I understand your average co pays are the same as we pay to see a doctor visits (except our low income and unemployed pay much less) and our prescriptions are free or small charge for some drugs. And we have no insurance to pay. Since you are a much bigger country with more wealth I think it will be even better for you.I assume there will be many many tubes tied and even more vasectomies in the near future. How can middle class or lower class afford to give their kids the lives they deserve?  U.S is a nightmare.Hey Bern...I don&#39;t have an awesome studio...could I get you to give me most of Joe&#39;s? thanks in advance...I&#39;m gonna give this a listen before the like or dislike. To me Bernie&#39;s points have always felt weak at best and deceptive at worst.  But everyone deserves a chance on JRE.Look. A millionaire speaking with another millionaire about money problems. 😆 😆 😆Gotta love Bernie!As a Bernie fan, Bernie had a bit less energy than he usually has. He might have a cold or might be a bit tired. But the answers were still excellent.Fuck Bernie Sanders!OH SHITSuch a presumptuous asshole. &quot;The American people want $15 an hour&quot;This is a vapid interview. Bernie has a chance to explain some numbers and he is going to talk in general terms. What’s the point of a several hour cnn interview?Check out all the Bernie Bros posing as Libertarians in the comments, saying they are giving Socialism a chance. Get out of here with that. POSERS. Paid Bernie staffers. Libertarians are not Socialist, end of Story.Like him or not, Bernie Sanders is far and away the Democrats’ best chance at beating Trump in 2020.MR.MEDURO? fuck Maduro and fuck sandersLOL Rogan would hate Sanders&#39; economic policies ahahaha Rogan wants to stay RICHOnly one hour?! I&#39;m feelin&#39; the BernHow do we pay for it? Doesn&#39;t answer and goes on a 10 minute story lol. By taxing us just say it already lol.Free health care and free college doesn&#39;t help much when you can&#39;t afford food, clothes, and shelter. A $15 minimum wage DOES NOT EVEN COME CLOSE! Support the Freedom Dividend! Andrew Yang for 2020! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang">#YangGang</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YangGang2020">#YangGang2020</a>Must be annoying having a conversation with a guy that rarely looks upDid you ask him why he claims to be against corporate greed while simeltaneously having Wall Street&#39;s cock down his throat?The bern!!I say what I want but this guy faced the corrupted Dems full front in 2016 and still is now (fake news keep bashing him). I&#39;m fed up with the corporations running the Republican and Democratic parties. We need more people like this. If Trump faces another Crooked Hillary, the choice is gonna be the same as 2016 for me.This should&#39;ve been 6hrs long with a white board presentation and ended w/ Bernie reading us a bedtime story...Anybody who says &quot;I believe in the 2nd amendment&quot; but then says in the next sentence &quot;we need to ban assault weapons&quot;, that person does NOT believe in the 2nd amendmentI honestly wish(ed) this was a really well thought deepfake,This shows just how DESPERATE Bernie is, to be on this Podcast. never vote for someone this desperate.Oh shit Joe finnaaaallllyyyyy got Larry David on. Love Curb Your Enthusiasm.I&#39;m surprised this commie actually came onHoly Shit?!?!Here we go!Can’t wait for this to go around people will see how a real person sounds as a politicianNo......fuckin....way.  trump is next thenJoe: So like...<br />Bernie: In other countries...wow! im just, wow! Amazed with this good one. Thank you Joe and Bernie  🌞🌻.WOWMy nigga Bernie!!The dnc stoke the last election from you. Why cuck, Bernie?Bernie has brought up one thing that i find appealing as a conservative and that is the “top 1 percent” yes taxing the rich likely wont impact them much but the idea of taxing them at a slightly higher rate then the lower and middle class and receiving that money is appealing, paired with yangs idea of $1000 a month and id honestly support it. Its not a traditional way but in economics a saftey net is a necessity and funding it through taxing the people who make more then everyone seems honest but would it ever really make a difference probably not.Right wing snowflakes melting in the comments !Do not vote for this nut job <br />He plans to double ur taxesI’ve spent over a quarter million dollars on my education not to mention nearly 20 years, please tell me why I owe you the fruits of my hard work and labor for free?Preaches living wage while under paying his staffEVERYONE CARES ABOUT RUSSIAN TROLLS——ITS THE lobbyist INTERFERING WITH EVERYTHING. HOW CAN DEMOCRACY AND TRUTH PREVAIL WHEN THE MONEY RUNS EVERYTHING. ITS A FUCKING JOKELet&#39;s see what this hard working, successful leader lays down.I&#39;m to the right of ghengis khan but I appreciate Joe for bringing on someone like Bernie Sanders. We need to hear all viewpoints.Word on the street is if you listen to this podcast Bernie will give you free stuffI paid national insurance for healthcare coverage for 30 years. Got ill, got free healthcare (funded thru taxation) got treatment, got well. Got thrown back into the job market PDQ (I&#39;m self employed) and worked again. Contributed to society, earned good money and paid my income derived taxes.<br />Didn&#39;t go broke. Didn&#39;t go bankrupt, lose my house and didn&#39;t forfeit my kids inheritance.<br />I live in the UK.Guarantee Hilary could never have an honest conversation like this for an hourI never dreamed I would ever find such progressive ideas being discussed and <b>promoted</b> on the JRE, but to hear it straight from the horse&#39;s mouth? It&#39;s a dream come true. We don&#39;t even need Jimmy Dore to come back on, Bernie&#39;s got it fuckin&#39; covered.Why are Conservatives willing to Vote for Socilal Democratic Canidates like tulsi Gabbard but Not Bernie Sanders??????? Both him and Tulsi agree on M4A, Tuition free college, lowering Drug prices,   Ending the wars,   Immigration Reform, and legalizing Marajuana. Conservatives are weird manFirst thing out of the gate is that we need the government to force private news networks (which many of us personally detest) to grant x amount of time to each candiate.<br /><br />Screw government encroachment. If you dont realize that you lose liberty just about everytime a law is passed, I dont know what to tell you.Can Sanders form a sentence without mentioning other countries?Only white millennials and degenerates love socialism/communism. <br />Socialism destroyed my once beautiful countryBernie Sanders 2020.You&#39;re the best, Joe.He should ask Trump to come on tooWoah!Bernie Sanders on Joe Rogan my dreams have come trueWho is fact checking this dink? 12 years my ass miss green new deal.How are you going to fix this? Well its simple... let me respond with more problems that most Americans would agree with but absolutely doesn&#39;t answer your questionHave trump on nextOMG WHHHAAAAATHrm, only downside was bernie not looking joe in the eyes on his memorized statements.  Other than that.  Bernie kept on point.  Plus being on campaign.  I honor him for taking the time for a podcast. From a regular person that got lucky in life in hollywood.  Was funny enough to sneak into 90s sitcom and reality tv and yet, podcasted for a goof.  Now, has some of the most important people in the USA coming to his show and giving him an hour.  That is making it.Bernie is now demanding free TV shows to go along with free everything elseget trump onFeel my weight in front 🏃‍♂️<br />Following the sound 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️<br />Moves away so fast 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️<br />Falling to the ground 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ .................................................<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />🌠 Bernie Sanders Running For President 🌠Wow Bernie makes a lot of sense.Bernie Sanders without a shadow of a doubt is the best candidate in this election. He is a politician who will bring true change and begin a political revolution which is desperately needed in this country. No longer should the greed and selfishness of the 1% and massive corporations rule this country as they do. Bernie will lead with genuine love, consciousness, and compassion for humanity and will aim to make America a more equal and fair place for all peoples. It’s not a matter of left vs right, it’s a matter of which politician is the most loving, the most humane, the most generous, the most conscious, and the most selfless.love you Bernie, but Yang is the 21st century.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=26m00s">26:00</a> min pay attention everyoneRespect to any conservative who actually watched the entirety and listened. Bonus points to any who paused and looked things up/fact checked along the way. 😉👍When discussing health care expenses, I hope he addresses law suits. You can’t watch TV for very long before you see a commercial from a law firm looking to sue some part of the medical industry. Yet, we never hear about tort reform. The attorneys make money in settlements because the plaintiffs know it would cost more to defend themselves in court. The reason the same drug used for an animal costs ten times more for a human is because animals can’t sue.YYOOOO LETS GOOO. Im voting for Trump, but i am excited to hear thisAre Bernie’s ideas radical? No... wanting to help people is the least we can do as humans.<br /><br />But, is the implementation of his ideas radical? Yes. <br /><br />Anything mandated by the government requires force to back it up. Force, in its simplest form, is the ability to remove resources from one individual in order to allocate those resources elsewhere. Force is violence if voluntary participation is not allowed. <br /><br />We should not be FORCING others to help each other. We should be TEACHING and SHOWING each other the importance of helping one another instead.<br /><br />Voluntary participation is humane participation. Mandated participation is radical, dangerous, and should be shunned.Thank you Joe Rogan.This guy is a one trick ponyJoe asks what he will do if he becomes president. All Bernie did was use his talking points and bring up issues, not once did he talk about an actual strategy to fix anything.I&#39;m from kentucky, yeah we don&#39;t want you hereI&#39;m with the man that walked with Martin Luther King... Enough saidwhere did this come from? was not expecting this.The dnc stoke the last election from you. Why cuck, Bernie?This guy has had the same message since 1701 ..Reporting in at 80K viewsFrom the comment section one thing comes to mind, people saying i&#39;m this side, i&#39;m that side, is politics a sport? Do people wear some kind of a shirt?  Forever? There&#39;s no room for a change of mind?This guy lies every time he opens his mouth. A socialist is just a communist without a gun. None of his economic ideas work when you work out the math. He believes is what stalin and Hitler promoted but the group he is going after are conservatives and free thinkers.Bro.... bernie on the fucking podcast..If hes not a Zionist shill I&#39;ll eat my hat<br /><br /><br />Btw hes lying about Canadian healthcareSocialism has no place in AmericaBernie: &quot;I believe in the second amendment.&quot;<br />Right wing nut: &quot;he&#39;s gonna take our guns like Obama did!&quot;Bernie is a communist ass clownJoe got a natzie on line wow lost respect again help the fucking people on street 1st then fix the world you ask zero good questions  joe zeroThe fact that some people come to this hour long interview 10 minutes after it’s posted and immediately dislike, shows me that there is a large portion of this community that is simply not willing to have a conversation in good faith. :(Yes!!! Bernie2020!! Thank you Joe!Gtfo!! I need to cancel my date early to listen to this.... damn it Joe Rogan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WE the PEOPLE need to fight the push of ongoing censorship, we can’t allow them to slowly chip at our privileges and rights.Bernie hates time constraints but instead of staying on joes podcast for hours explaining his policies and how they would work he only gives joe a hour of his time and than Bernie goes... and gives speeches about the same shit over and over... or how come the people running start YouTube channels explaining everything they want to do years before the election process?Cheers to Joe for being awesome enough to get Bernie on.<br />Tulsi for president and the bern for vice pres!America&#39;s dad Bernie Sanders!!!)🤸ATTENTION BERNIE AND ELIZABETH ;   YOU CAN BOTH BEAT JOE BY RUNNING AS A TEAM!  WHO EVER HAS THE HIGHEST POLLING GETS TO BE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME OF THE DEM PRIMARIES.  THE CANDIDATE WITH THE LOWEST NUMBERS GETS TO BE VICE PRES!   JOE IS OLD AND LOSING HIS MIND, WE NEED CHANGE, NOT MORE OF THE SAME! 3 MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION, THE OTHER CANDIDATE SHOULD PUT THEIR SUPPORT BEHIND THE OTHER!If Bernie Sanders can&#39;t beat Donald Trump, then it shows you the extremely poor condition the US education system is in.Joe: You know that DMT is fantas----<br />Bernie: But have you tried cigars?Why has he not had Trump on the show? He likes to talk alot of shit about him.... but never digs into the actual facts. Joe pisses me off with that type of shit... when someone can prove him wrong with facts he asks like it is no big deal and alot of times the facts are on deep subjects.incoming corporate shills here to insult berniethe problem is candidates say alot of stuff...then once in office nothing happens...or it gets worse....So they raise the minimum wages.... with the way taxes work they just take more from you when you earn more. Is this really a problem solver?Damn this is sad... Abandon all your principles to &quot;connect with the youth&quot;.America has less mass shootings per capita than France, Norway, Switzerland and many others. And we are only tenth for gun violence in world.  Yes it&#39;s a problem but ppl need to atleast be honest with information. <a href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mass-shootings-by-country/">http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mass-shootings-by-country/</a>&quot;They don&#39;t care about the health and well-being of the American people, all they care about is making money&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Hey guys, go to Onnit dot com and use the code Rogan to get 15% off some Snake Oil designed to convince meatheads that they&#39;re smart&quot;I haven&#39;t watch this yet but if joe doesn&#39;t bring up the fake cellphone call imma be piss lolNo fucking wayI heard Elon Musk was here.One problem is joe just agrees and doesn’t push himTrump sanders Clinton joe rogan debate special podcastI don’t think you’re a dictator, I just don’t think you understand mathHow can Bernie basically be the only one who calls it like it is and is outspoken against the American oligarchy?America finally waking up. Greed is not good and should not be tolerated. People before profit.Whoa<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=23m20s">23:20</a>  Bernie gets triggered ✊👊😂🤣not even half way in and i’ve got like 10 follow up questions that Joe should’ve asked. where is Tim Pool when u need him!?!?78k views?IT HAPPENED!OMG, it actually happened!This seems problematic in a disingenuous manner 🙄this old man will never be president.holy tits the last person I expected to be on his show is Bernie SandersFirst ever JRE I ever thumbs down...Joe What is going on????Joe Rogan is trying to crash the internet.im convinced that the people that disliked this are fucken idiots that base their entire identity on politics and are most likely racist fuckwits that voted for TrumpLmao look at the triggered snowflakes downvoting this as soon as it gets uploaded.Y😎 this fake podcast? No way it&#39;s real, this is too cool.Bernie and every other govt rep can stay TF outa my business. Deliver the mail, protect the borders and leave me TF alone.Could you imagine Trump holding a conversation for an hour?Anyone that goes on this asshole&#39;s show should be disqualified from running for office.WHEN I SAW THIS I WAS FILLED WITH SUDDEN ABSOLUTE HAPPINESSDon’t let your cast become a political platform joe ffs .bernie just won the election with this one cuz20 minutes in and Rogan is either throwing Bernie softballs or he&#39;s luring him in and making him comfortable in order to open the conversation up.Yes, i love using my money to pay for someone else to have shit that refuses to work.Joe Rogan is amazing for allowing differing viewpoints to coexist and shuffle out the ones that should prevail !! We all can learn so much from each other’s differing perspectives !Im rolling. Up for thisGet Ron Paul on.Lobbyists don&#39;t exist in nationalised health care because they strong arm the crap out of the medical industry, then we pay for all the innovation... I hate Bernie sometimesWhy is Joe allowing himself to be brainwashed?Bernie Sanders has ZERO chance of becoming POTUS in 2020 but I will watch this with an open mind and we&#39;ll see if I feel the Bern.oh shit my guy Bernie on The Rogan Podcast!!Everything is getting more expensive because THE US DOLLAR IS GOING TO ZERO!Why does Bernie not look at Joe for very long?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=53m27s">53:27</a> Rogan and Sanders Marijuana Pipe Session: your welcomeHealth care is not a human right because it requires the labor of another human and you don&#39;t have the right to that person&#39;s labor.Go trump kill niggersomg bernie fuckin sanders. hes mostly a knucklehead but dam this should be good<b>Bernie Sanders is all talk. He&#39;s basically a warmonger for huge tax hikes, has no concept of capital flight. He pushed Russiagate, supported Jussie Smollet, attacked the Covington Kids, has been dead silent on Julian Assange, voted for sanctions in Iraq- which killed a half a million children, voted for Bombing Yugoslavia- which even people in his campaign resigned over, and he voted for funding the trillion dollar F-35, the biggest waste in history- and the damned thing didn&#39;t even work. Some criticisms of certain candidates are debatable, but all I just listed are terrible, shitty mistakes that point to either dishonesty or downright misrepresentation of character. Tulsi 2020- fuck having another baby boomer in office.</b>libertarians are either low IQ or pedophiles, often times bothWait....you have Bernie Sanders on here...... yet no plans for not Keanu Reeves?Yaaaaaaaas something to listen to on the way home!!Bernie &amp; Tulsi 2020 for real change Americans deserveJoe Rogan surprises nobody by having this socialist scumbag on his showJoe needs to start giving hints before these uploads or I&#39;m going to need a Nokia 3310 for every time my phone flies out my handBernie, don&#39;t come to Canada to buy your drugs. It&#39;s wrong. I am lobbying my government to block all &quot;drug tourism&quot; coming into Canada. <br />Seriously, it is unethical thing to do and it&#39;s wrong.Ask him why he didn&#39;t pay his campaign workers 15 an hourYou should’ve asked him what he thought of Sacha Baren Cohen, since he trolled him in “this is America”😂Fun fact: The entire platform of every candidate running on the Democratic Party ticket are completely basing their campaigns on Sanders 2016 run. The Grassroots funded campaign (even though Sanders is the only one to not have billionaire or corporate contributors) Medicare for all (even though him and Warren are the only two for abolishing private insurance) Wall Street speculation taxes, climate change action, and affordable higher education/housing. Yet the media is smearing Bernie for people like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. (Establishment dems that don’t give a shit about the people.)Let’s fucking goooooooooBernie, can I have some of your profit?Bernie gets itNo one wants to hear from anti-free speech socialist scumSanders Rogan 2020Weak interview its Jack all over again.Bernie &quot;hypocrite gimme all your money and rights&quot; SandersMight have to unsubscribe from JRE... can’t believe he had this goofy bastard on the podcastWait what lmao Joe Rogan the savage!!“Let me pull that sucker to your mouth, Bernie”Trump didn&#39;t meet with the Koch brothersBernie starts off on a bad foot admitting that they are all acting.He just doesn&#39;t make sense on a lot of issues. Should have pressed him more.co·er·cion<br />/kōˈərZHən,kōˈərSHən/<br /> Learn to pronounce<br />noun<br />the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats.I just had a convo today about him having bernie on, how fucking uncanny!!!!How much did this fucker have to pay you to get on this show lolImagine voting for this old cuckJRE: Tanking US presidential campaigns since 2019.So many insecure cry babies on the left and right upset that not everyone thinks exactly like them. Kill yourselves pleaseeeeeeNext on blah,blah,blah.Yang gangYou don’t go to any dr you want, you go to any dr you’re willing to wait for. If everyone tries to see the best dr, everyone is gonna wait years.American conservatives are retarded. The Conservative party of Canada and the British conservatives concede that healthcare is a human right.If only Uncle Joey was there ...Joe makes the point about small businesses eventually running out of business and Bernie shifts to McDonald&#39;s and Amazon. Bro you getting shit for not paying your staff 15$\h and you have the balls to spin the narrative. Bottom line is you raise the minimum wage, businesses close, inflation rises and unemployment rises. It&#39;s fucking simple math. Amazon is going to automate a big chunk of their workforce and they could care less about your moronic minimum wage.Minimum wage: raise it, prices rise, cost of living rises, minimum wage no longer a living wage.  Free market finds the balance. Socialism finds inefficient systems and uninspired souls.Libertarian here, don&#39;t like Bernie at all. But I love how Joe has him on the showBernie “Agender” Sanders20 mins ago was posted. 70 000 views. 3000 comments.Joe once commented that Bernie Sanders head comes straight out of his torso, and he must be in pain all the time....<br /><br />Will Joe give him some tips to fix his posture?Joe&#39;s Bernie impression sounds more like Bernie than BernieThis man is know for praising the Cuban revolution and loved Moscow during communism and celebrated his honeymoon in the USSR... now he does say many valid things. Capitalism has gone overboard and people can&#39;t pay there medical bills but i believe deep down he is more extreme and left then we actually know.Hey Bernie you’re a fucking morondmt comment<br />...<br />😂😂😂😂<br />...<br />bottom textFkn liarThere&#39;s nothing you can say that will make me want to give you 60% of my pay checkGuys, if you&#39;re reading the comments before watching the interview, go back to the video and ignore them. People are going to be trying to influence you to support or reject Sanders. Listen to the interview and make your own decision based off what you hear. Come back for the shitposting after.Quality of Care is not better in those other countries, also wait times are up to 20x longer. Have a broken leg, have fun waiting 4 days for surgery!Hard passFirst three minutes  Bernie talks about how other countries do this and do that .... Bernie , your in the United States of America !I think Bernie wouldn’t be a terrible second pick, but it’s clear that we have a futurist and a person with a present state of mind for present problems and that is Andrew Yang. I’m voting for YangBarely in and sad this isn&#39;t 3 hours.Hello BurnieIt is a YOUmin right!thank you so much for having Bernie on. I hope people in the left that are very critical of your show can see that you are trying to offer different perspectives.Where&#39;s Bernie&#39;s oxygen canister?And just like I&#39;m voting for Sanders. Hahadid he say he could just walk into a gun show and pass a background check (thought he just said you there isn&#39;t background checks at gunshows) and buy 12 guns and sell them to criminals to do criminal acts???? Thats fuckin illegal BERNIE!!Healthcare is not a ‘Human Right’, because somebody’s gotta pick up the damn bill. There is no such thing as ‘free healthcare.’ One way or another, someone has to pay, individually or collectively. <br /><br />Ah, wait, I forgot that all socialists think that money grows on trees!Joe had Andy Ruiz- Mexican American heavyweight champion and Bernie Sanders on in less than a week, The Trump clan must be furious at him right now 🤣🤣Fuck yes I’ve waited for thisThis is the Jack Dorsey interview all over again....😒Fuck this shit, have trump on u fucking moronIt&#39;s a u man rightFantastic guy!This podcast used to be your stoner uncle talking conspiracy theories to a legitimate political platformAs someone from outside the USA, some of what Bernie says is correct, but the governments do not look at the profits of the drug company when they look at purchasing medicines. They negotiate prices. You can’t just tell private companies what they will take as a price for their medicines. The real world does not work like that, unless you want to end up like Venezuela.Okay man, I am only 30mins in and plan to see this through, but what the heck Joe absolutely zero challenge on anything yet? How can you possibly discuss minimum wage with out bringing up inflation?! We had a real chance to learn something here but so far it&#39;s just letting Bernie spout his agenda with no challengelmao it&#39;s been up 25 mins and the psychos in this community already hit it with 1.8k dislikes. I understand people being fans and liking right away but not viewing just to dislike. but but .... ThE BaTtlE oF IdEaUzWtf Bernie Sandersjoe is getting too leftist these days. bring back stefan molyneux if you want to actually be an open minded person. like him or dislike him he&#39;s one of the brightest minds out there right now, one of joe&#39;s best ever guests and has some of the strongest arguments for the political right, but joe stopped bringing him on because he apparently got too controversial. that should be a red flag right there. not truly open minded. caving to leftist pressure so much for taming that inner bitchBernie made NO ZERO Eye Contact......Only major country that doesn&#39;t provide healthcare as a right?<br /><br />He&#39;s either plain dead wrong, or his idea of &#39;major country&#39; is skewed just enough to make him right.Bernie ducking and dodging those lobbyist questions, wonder why that is?  <br /><br /><br />Hope Joe asks about the DNC screwing him out of the 2016 nomination in favor of Clinton, and then Bernie endorsing her.   A lot of Bernie voters went for Trump because  they felt Bernie sold out.Feel the Fuckin BernI think bernie has a good heart and bad ideas.<br /><br />Good conversation though for sureNever disliked a video so fast lolI could push back harder on a garden hose joeSocialism = Slavery<br />Capitalism = Freedom<br />God Bless America<br />Land of the FreeI don’t believe health care  should be a right it should be earned.<br />This guys a joke.Bernie towed the party line after the DNC fucked him. He&#39;s a grifter and a liar, all talk and no substance.and the internet is now explodedThis is an amazing interviewKyle Cucklinsky is stroking his tiny liberal dick right now😂Its a solar min period you idiot of course its hot god joe is a fkn loserCan Bernie not look Joe in the eyes? Really off puttingBig mistake by Bernie on coming on here. The only Democrat I was considering voting for, but man this guy doesnt have an original idea to solve any problems in this country.All I want if Bernie smoking pot with Joebernie talking to joe like hes having a private father to son heart to heartHe’s admitting it’s a rigged system!  WtfDemocratic death nail.....CLIMATE CHANGE........Who cares if I can&#39;t feed my family fuck the climate!!!!!!Cant stand this guy but ill listen.WWWWHHAT1 minute in and he says &quot;the DNC is in a hard position because they have 20 candidates and want to give everyone a fair shake&quot; does he recall the 2016 nominationWhen you Pee does it Bern?FUCKING SOCIALISTBernie Sanders is what is known as a Dangerous idiot. No he&#39;s NOT evil, but his ideas are so stupid they&#39;ve killed more humans in the 20th century than war. However, im glad joe had him on. The only downside to free speach is, there are so many people who think Bernie is a genius just because his ideas sound so heartwarming. And they lack the critical thinking required to they of the repercussions of his ideas. Socialism in all forms sounds like utopia as long as you don&#39;t think about repercussions. However i enjoyed the podcast. I gives me insight into how these people get followers. Its almost cult like with the promise of utopia.Damn. I didn&#39;t think this was gonna happen!Joe should stop letting Jamie book &quot;talent&quot; ffsDamn his voice sounds great on that podcast mic!Bernie “I bring a knife when I go jogging” SandersThanks for having him, I can finally see why people call him crazy. Just a weird old guy with no real answersHe always talks about health care, his socialist ideas are horrible. Our country will turn into a venezuela. His talking points are not effective and will crumble our economy.In come the hatersJoe Rogan needs to get the president on.I thought Obama care would fix everything!  Love Bernie but socialism is not the way. Equality of opportunity. Not equality of outcome.more clip[s please. i don&#39;t have 1 hourDamn. I didn&#39;t think this was gonna happen!People’s Champ right there man!! ✊🏼“We gotta beat you again old man?” <b>insert spongebob meme</b>Adolph was a socialist....FEEL THE FUCKING BERN YOU FUCKING JOE ROGAN CONSERVACUCKSTo be fair, Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex. Exactly 35 months later, JFK warned us too. And he threatened to expose them all publically, while dismantling them. Look how it&#39;s grown since then. How did it grow??? Our secretary of defense Mark esper, an arms dealer for Raytheon, and ex military 4 star generals retiring but joining the board at Raytheon. Everything leads back to Raytheon/CIA. Now what the fuck are we going to do about it?? Cuz TULSI can&#39;t do it alone. JFK tried that shit before.Does Boynie seriously think he can stop Drumpf? He&#39;s such low energy. Joe should have Trump on next. Not even 20 minutes in I&#39;m falling asleep. Nappy Bernie YAWN <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FUCKSOCIALISM">#FUCKSOCIALISM</a>Trump is a fraud.

Weird shit for a collectivist to own....You can tell Bernie respects and values his time with Joe more than ANY corporate media host he’s ever talked to on MSNBC/CNN/etc. That’s why I love this guy.

He doesn&#39;t practice what he preaches.fuck yeah Bernie 2020I had to white-knuckle through this podcast. <br />God he is such a dishonest communist scumbag. <br />Everything he says is  absolute pie in the sky crap.<br />Snake oil salesman.holy shit! this should be good!Hellz yeah!Bernie &quot;Low-Energy&quot; SandersBernie is wrong about economics.Canada also received a human rights violation for wait times to receive medical care. I can get seen and treated tomorrow if I needed to in the good ol USA right now.Bernie is #1!I think for Joe to be fair you cannot have 3 presidential candidates who are Democrat and not have Trump on the podcast. Like Bernie said give everyone a fair shot.Fuck Bernie&#39;s political views, but im glad you let him come on the show.Orange Man BadFuck you Bernie Sanders<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m52s">4:52</a> : &quot;I LOVE PUDDING&quot;Commie Sanders.

He&#39;s a doormat and will get walked all over by anyone who wants to. And honestly I&#39;m not thrilled about having such an old person as President.BERNIE IS THE ONLY HOPE FOR THIS COUNTRY! SHOUTOUT JOE ROGAN FOR HAVING HIM ON!lol gateway to alt-right btwI think joe should have Bernie back on and he should have someone from the other side to have a conversation. I vote for Steven Crowder lol.Canada is a U.S. vassal state and for that matter, so is the UK and EU. If they had to spend the actual cost of their defense, which right now is a burden the U.S. largely bears, they could not afford their universal healthcare system.<br /><br />The U.S. Navy alone is 3/4ths of the entire EU military budget. Who is going to step up and fund a navy sufficiently capable to protect the trade routes on which their economies depend?This guy is so full of shit. You&#39;ll never be the president of the United States. hahahaha.The problem with Bernie are the American voters unfortunately... It&#39;s sad.Harsh truth, but he&#39;s had his entire life to make changes and campaign.  Way too late to mount a serious campaign for Bernie, he&#39;d make a good VP or part of the team at the whitehouse. He&#39;s never going to be the guy who wins the popular voteAmazing job Joe. Logical, rational people want to see all sides of the argument and decide from there. Acting on preconceived notions from any side is lazy. Thank you for allowing people to voice their opinions through your platform.Oh my god. This just broke my brain. Joe might be the most influential person on the planet right now.I&#39;m not a Bernie fan at all but his campaign managers are wayyy ahead of the rest putting him on Rogan, the new CarsonBernie 20201.21 gigawatts!!!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=4m22s">4:22</a> Bernie cough!Incoming Gavin incels... 3..2..1..I&#39;m not an American so I have no dog in this fight but why do your Republicans say they hate Nazis, Dictators, and The Government but support a party full of the Rich people who pay off and own your Government along with the people who fight against your own people&#39;s civil liberties and rights? Is your ENTIRE country on Meth? Serious question. No wonder a reality show star runs your establishment.I was gonna start rewatching the Harry Potter series tonight but this will doAs of now, it&#39;s been 24 mins since the video was uploaded and has 1.7k dislikes already! Did these people even watch this?! The video itself is 68 mins long!Will Joe ask him why he accepted the democrats and Hillary shafting him in the last presidential run??12 years!!!! We’re all gonna die!!! Ahhh! Vote for meDo you idiots realise he is openly stating he will go after the American economy when he says wall street speculation? Just so you know every single persons retirement and every dollar invested in america is traded on speculation. Say good bye to your retirements dipshits.Americans really need to understand the difference between socialism and social democracyFeel tha burnnnn lmaoI  voted for this cuck, but he lost to Hillary so i said fuck it im voting Trump.I think Hillary Clinton&#39;s Dildo is still in his ass. No coming back from supporting corrupt DNC. You had it all and chose power establishment over cheated voters soooo GFYS. You will ALWAYS be all talk and no action. I&#39;m voting 3 rd party.BRING ME PUDDDDING!MAGA!How about this....if you make 500 dollars a week cash no tax that&#39;s only 25k a year...and that right there is why us blue collar workers can&#39;t buy a house or property...food, clothing, electric,gas , insurance, a car....etc and the list goes on...Every presidential candidate should be on JRE. Fuck debates!Shit, get Elizabeth Warren on this so we can rip her up.Just hearing Bernie talk made me feel hungry. Socialists have that power.Holy shit balls!!LolI don&#39;t know how anyone can downvote this. Fantastic podcast. As someone who strongly dislikes the media/news, I try to learn about these candidates through the internet. These podcasts really allow everyone to speak fairly and freely for long periods of time regardless of your opinions!Im not looking forward to the fights again or every politician lying to us and trying to take our rights away. But as a gun guy id rather bernie win over trump again. At least one will do some good with the bad instead of just bad. Fuck id rather have obama over Trump because with obama the gun talk was just that, talk. No action, none of my shit was taken away and once again bump stocks are stupid as shit but thats not the point its about rate increasing devices which could be boiled down all the way to semi auto guns, you could have long heavy triggers, limited rounds, complicated reloads, thin hammers, heavy resets etc which is no good for guns. That could become the new guns. Everything is all tricks with the left people wake up. Edit 15 minimum is to much for the jobs that people will do. If i make my 15 doing construction i could go work for starbucks make the same, have a seat stay out of the heat or cold and be on my phone. Me doing construction and making the same as any other job is not fair. Life isnt fair but if we are gonna make it fair then we have to play this game. I will not put in all that effort and eventual harm to my body if im making the same as some sit around Bob. I just wont ill demand more cash, carpentry/demolition is a very important job that is always needed and you dont want to piss us off. We wont build your shit, we will build our shit. Same goes for the people who keep your wifi up, your power on, your water on, your food in your stores etc.Bernie didn&#39;t really answer anything. He just gave examples from past governments. And let&#39;s all think. This guy pretty much produced the cow fart genius that is AOC.The 1 hour playtime and softball questions make it feel like an ad for bernie. <br /><br />I guess if he asked any tough questions, nominees won&#39;t come on but man this feels literally scripted. Like literally looks Joe is reading his questions.Don’t like Bernie, but props for recognizing both sides of the spectrumMr. Magooby<a href="https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2012/3/29/1078852/-75-Ways-Socialism-Has-Improved-America">https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2012/3/29/1078852/-75-Ways-Socialism-Has-Improved-America</a>whaaaaEvery presidential candidate should be on JRE. Fuck debates!socialist policies by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m58s">2:58</a> lol1 hour 7 minute video uploaded 24 minutes ago and already 1.7k down votes....🙄Never trust somone with shoulders in line with ears. So sorry don&#39;t like him. And he promoted hillary. So fuck off no neck old cunt.YANG TULSI BERNIE....<br />fuck it Joe go all the wayGuess Bernie, Gabbard and Yang are all alt-right nowJOE ROGAN &amp; TRUMP NEEDS TO HAPPENWhen does he ask about aliens?In FINLAND, Bernie would be considered a MODERATE.     Thats how HARD RIGHT Corporations and Weathy have dragged America.Canadian here: I wouldn’t trade our health care system for the US model for any reason.So when is president Donald Trump coming on?Wow, nice get Joe!&#39;Fuck those pharmaceutical companies........that keep making medical advances that save lives...and that all of the OTHER countries also get to use in their free healthcare systems.&#39;<br /><br /><br />Please list all of the major medical advances that we got from those countries with their &quot;great healthcare systems.&quot;<br /><br />He hates ANYONE making money, even if they save lives......unless you write a book, of course. lolSanders is the type of guy that would rather make me listen to Schaub.YOOO WOT.Ordinary people can’t come together when they are divided in race, gender, politics. Maybe pitch your campaign based on everything ordinary people have in common. Like money. Re distribute the current taxes. Allocate them in the manor they were intended. Fix that first.FEEL the BERN Bro RoganSeriously....Just another crazy socialist<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=0m29s">0:29</a> bruh he just ripped off Andrew YangI was goin to watch this vid.. but I got high..Noooi wayyyyyy Joe got Bernie. <br />JOE YOU ARE THE NEW OPERA!I have my criticisms towards Bernie&#39;s politics, but damn if I don&#39;t respect him for reaching out to the other side.The fact that around 20% of the votes so far are negative, barely 20-odd minutes after this went live, reflects an intellectual uncuriousness that is concerning. You can disagree with his socialist leanings (I do) while agreeing with other elements of his worldview, or just enjoying the conversation, and then judging the episode accordingly afterwards. What proportion downvoted instinctively? A fair number, I&#39;d opine. Very sad.Build the wallNed Flanders!! Oh just Bernie Sanders. Sanders makes Flanders look like Slash.Back in 16 I felt the Bern<br />Now .. it&#39;s just luke warm nothing burger jibber jabbber.Government owned Tv! Listen up peopleTrump2020Oh please tell me how I’m poor because I live in Kentucky! I make $65,000 a year. Work 4 days a week and live in a nice 2000 sqft house with 2 cars. All of that with 0 debt. Maybe get out and get a job and stop going to college for liberal arts degrees.I gotta stop about 11 minutes in and just ask...joe do you buff your head? Like that baby has an impressive sheen going on.“Just put the 99% into the 1%”Way to go Bernie!!!<br /><br />BTW Marijuana ain’t heroin lol your riteWOAH! holy shit wasn&#39;t expecting this videoGonna press him on how socialism kills? Doubt it.Oh my god I can&#39;t believe this is real! Yes!!!Wow Bernie Sanders!! Joe Rogan is the best . Best pod cast love the channelwhen does he ask bernie about dmt?Lets push every candidate to do long form podcast interviews. The American people do have the patience to watch or listen to 20 candidates on a few hour long podcasts.Holy shitSanders is a fucking grifter!Holy!  This is awesomeBernie Sanders the type of guy that flushes the toilet after fartingIt took Bernie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=2m57s">2:57</a> to mention free and accessible. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m impressed or annoyed.I don&#39;t like Bernie at all but Joe should have got Killer Mike on this podcast with Bernie I think that would be a good podcast!I like Tulsi but why has a quarter of Joe Rogan fans given Bernie a thumbs down already??   SMH..Great to get him on, I know all politicians talk a good game, but I like what this guy has to say. However, in my home, UK, these TV debates he speaks of only came in just over 10 years ago, &amp; I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t get half hour to speak, uninterrupted. There are similar rounds of questions &amp; maybe a little bit of a longer &quot;final statement&quot; from each. However, it&#39;s even worse now, as we have the leaders of ALL the parties, even the peripheral ones like The Green Party &amp; Plaid Cmyru - whom only govern in Wales. In fact, on the last debates, our Prime Minister at the time, Theresa May, didn&#39;t even go to at least one of the TV debates - it&#39;s not required for each party to attend. I suppose it&#39;s different due to it not being a 2 party competition (although it pretty much is) &amp; we vote for a party, whereas USA votes for an administration, i.e. The Trump/Obama administration.I wish someone who knew what they were talking about would be on here when Joe gets a podcast guest like thisGoin to the PEOPLEI disagree with Bernie’s policies, but the dude got shafted by his own party out of the nomination against Trump.No way great job JoeHe Blasted Trump!!  But were did he go on his Honeymoon again.. this guy is a communist plane an simple.. an his followers think hes just a  SocialistBernie “I wrote a best selling book so of course I’m a millionaire” Sanders.Dan Carlin would be a good interviewer for BernieJuxtaposed with Yang&#39;s podcast, Bernie is really disappointingMy boss is a die hard Democrat and he is worried about a $15/hour minimum wage. Said he will have to cut hours and lay off.Fuck you joe fuck you Bernie i hope you both fkn chokeThis Communist would ruin our country within months. Joe throwing softballs is pathetic as well.Bernie looks like he has had a long and rough 2 terms... oh shit this is him before becoming President... he wouldn&#39;t survive 2 years let alone 2 terms lol.Holy shitYou’d have to pass legislation to force a private company to do the bidding of an elected gov official. My god what is going on.After I watched him kiss Hillary&#39;s ring I can&#39;t take any of this serious. I hope you guys enjoy the podcast though. Sum a muh bitchhessgimme my free shit bernie, im tired of workingOoooooohhhh $#!+ He got Bernie!!!!!!My grandpa went missing in Southern California. If anybody sees him please call me. He&#39;s  77 years old with white hair. He kinda makes you wonder what a boring/clean Andrew Dice Clay would be like.I&#39;m used to Joe rogan  Having those right wing nut job trump supporters on his show lol this refreshing someone with a brain♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>bravo joeI love the part where they talk about DMTJoe you gotta get trump on there after this to lay down the truth 👌1 hour podcast?  Wow, I guess Bernie cant handle the burn.  Is this Joe’s shortest podcast ever?  I havent listened yet.  Heres my prediction:  Bernie says his normal talking points and complains about USA, while proposing no realistic solutions besides turn USA into venezuela; Joe just agrees and says light hearted things to try and humanize bernie to young folks while not asking any critical questions.   Lets see how my guess is!Can anybody answer why doesn’t joe do live podcasts anymore?Didn&#39;t know this man had the ability to speak at a normal volumeThank you Joe!!!!18 mins in I&#39;m out of this crap show.MAGA MAGA gang gangVideo hasn’t been up 30 min n I see the trump bots out in full forceBernie From BKLYN!!Andrew Yang 2020Has Rogan stop doing live shows??Bernie you dont pay your own staff what you want to minimum wage to be you hypocritical titWhat a bunch of horse SHIT!This video was posted 20 minutes ago... it&#39;s an hour long and people are complaining.

I&#39;ve heard that&#39;s how they do it in third world countries (don&#39;t quote me on that) but it works 30 percent of the time every time!&quot; ... Give me a break, Bernie. You&#39;re still supporting a political party that cheated you out of a primary spot and talking about fairness and &quot;the equality of the Democratic process&quot; in the same breathe? ... What a joke.I’m not a fan of Bernie but I got to see his side of things, though I don’t agree I’m glad joe just talks to anyone from Alex Jones to Charlie Kirk, Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro, and now Bernie Im liking the political talk every once in awhile good shit joe&quot;It&#39;s exiting to have you here, man,... Mr. President.&quot;Sooooooo when does the ACTUAL President get the chance to defend himself.Wow! What a get! Congrats Joe and Jamie!Holy shithave you been to Vermont? LoLThat “public goods” ad thoughWithin the 1st 45sec you can tell this is going to be a great pcast2 minutes in Bernie already talked about passing legislation to enforce media participation in campaigns lmaoNow let&#39;s get Trump on!!Get Trump on...&quot;The only way that change takes place, is when ordinary people come together and stand up and fight to say the status quo is not working.&quot; Time to raid AREA 51.....Love it when he says raise the minimum wage to a living wage. This is the guy that was paying his campaign staff 13 per hour. They demanded 15, he gave it to them and then cut their hours.Just clicked play. Betting Joe panders as usual to whatever this clown proclaims.Sanders taking a page out of yangs playbookThis man is the only truly honest, authentic and sincere person I’ve ever seen in American politics in my entire life.Say the same things in the same ways and somehow that&#39;ll change things in a way it didn&#39;t before? Nope. Get young people in politics. Get this guy out of the way. He&#39;s an easy target, and he weakens those ideals he supports by being chronically ineffectiveGet trump<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=16m11s">16:11</a> idk he doesn&#39;t sound confidentI was a Bernie fan the first go around but feel like he sold out this time. I&#39;m excited to hear this out and give him another shot.Ugh climate change at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng&amp;t=17m51s">17:51</a> ...using AOC time table.. GIVE ME A BREAK FROM THAT STUPID DATA! CO2 is only 0.04% of ALL gasses in this planet, and they&#39;re saying it&#39;s gonna kill us. Stupidity.Bernie&#39;s headline quotes are good. But a lot of them are half truths.YES! YES! YES! BERNIE!Within the first few minutes,  it seems like Bernie hates the idea of people making money at all.WE WANT TRUMP!!!! He would do it Joe, get him on!!Bernie: i will raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks<br />Bernies staff: you dont even pay us that<br />Bernie: thats a Republican talking pointthis will be most watched video on you tube more than tulsi more than anything ever too  bad it&#39;s not liveOh shit Bernie Sanders!cant wait for the click bait JRE clips!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The comments here are gonna be toxic but also watch how the Bernie-haters are already being seriously ratio-ed in the Likes vs. Dislikes.The dislikes, dawg. You all are fantastically partisan.... I LOVE IT!Not one dislike or negative comment to Bernie is valid or cannot be effectively argued against. He represents the hope for an America to be proud of again! Bernie 2020!Get James O’KeefeClearly not listened to the whole podcast yet (no one has...) but was slightly disappointed when I saw it was 1 hour, don’t need 3 but 2 hours would be great.  Now I’ll see, might still be really interesting.Communist loo bagCant even pay his own ppl 15bux hr.. Sciences are political you atupid fkI disliked originally, but yeh this needs to get viral, near 20 mins in and he really doesn&#39;t have a clue... Sunlight and all... (edit sorry 19 mins in and heard the perfect Yes Minister reference)BERNIE!A 2019 Bernie is totally different than a 2016 Bernie which is why so many people have abandon him.  <br /><br />Socialist policies, identity politics, America sucks, pro open borders, pro hate speech laws, half the population is evil is a losing strategy.  <br /><br />I see this is the shortest JRE I&#39;ve seen. He probably couldn&#39;t go longer than an hour because it was his nap time.oh snap, this oughta be good... wait, only an hour long?!&quot;Hello, 🅱️ernie&quot;only an hour?!Life complete.Bernie or Yang. This is a hard decision.Bernie means well but..... ahhh.. minimum wage and blah blah blah.BS, you should learn a lesson from Matt Hughes and step out of the way of the oncoming (Trump) train, you old hippie! The new winning wave is coming through and you cannot spell triumph without Trump. Let&#39;s go! MAGA 2020Jesus look how horrible Bernie looksIf someone wants to shoot a mall up they’ll find a way to get a firearm, evil is just evil sadly it’s a part of our world, the solution is probably to stop covering them on the news and giving notoriety and not bringing it up. The media has to play some role cause they know they’ll be “notorious”. no news  coverage and instant death penalty is the only viable solution.You know what keeps prices down? Competition. Always has always will. If you want to make healthcare affordable, allow competition, remove regulations and stop corruption.Fuckn oldass socialist!!..old bastard is going to destroy the countryGet Trump and Alex Jones dude. That would be FUCKING insanity.OMG, Joe has Bernie Sanders on?<br /><br />Reddit Incel triggered powers activate...1600 dislikes in 11 minutes ?!<br /><br />also, why do I keep envisioning the top of Bernie’s headphones as a yamaka?!&quot;PUDDING!!!&quot;I will just unsubscride from this channel, why in the hell would you give this joke of man a platform is unbelievable, this commie bastarda should sell his homes and give it to the poor than this as hole can talk.Love how all of these right wingers talk shit about bernie all the while they say how great tulsi gabbard is... news flahs fuck heads... she agrees with bernie on nearly EVERYTHING!An American legend.Dems2020He&#39;s got my vote! Bernie 2020!<br />Now if only we could get rid of the electoral college so my vote would actually mean something in my state.Getting Trump on JRE would be top 10 most watched podcast evernever watched joe rogen before ... hope you put on a good show ... bernie tulsi 2020 !!!This comment section is so full of temporary poor millionaires it’s not even funny.Oh man, this should be good. Pressing play and rolling a joint.Who fucking cares?..Trump 2020 is a slam dunkI didn’t realize just how old he was until this.Greatest moment in podcast history!!!WHATYour promise lol ypu are a fkn millionaire you old hagIf You dont like Bernie,  You&#39;re just Ignorant, Delusional or just BOUGHT.     SAD.   Stop Holding America Back.I&#39;m Canadian so let me tell you when u need heart surgery your put on a waiting list and half the time those people die waiting on that list. Canadian&#39;s with money go to the states to get it quicker and with better doctorsSteven Crowder will chop this up and destroy Bernout.<br />        Change my mind!The decline in wealth is due to the fact that the federal reserve/ central banks have the power to print money out of thin air and dilute the purchasing power of the people. They then pay their cronies, lobbyists, politicians, etc to keep them rich and in power and The People poor and slaves to America Inc.his posture is terrible.The like-to-dislike ratio is already insane and this was uploaded like 20 minutes ago. Fucking Incels are just as triggered as the feminists they claim to hate so much and yet they see Bernie on the podcast and the reaction to dislike is automatic. Fuckin LOLMother fucker....it finally happenedJoe needs to have every democratic candidate on at the same time so they can have a real conversation 😂Bernie &quot;I want Government to control everything&quot; Sanders.wheres eddie bravo!?Get Trump &amp; Bernie on togetherBut <i>were</i> they live?Bern- &quot;Da one pacent!!!&quot;<br />Toe Rogan -&quot;Please quit screaming Bernie&quot;<br />Bern- *Whisper screams &quot;DA ONE PACENT!!!!!&quot;<br />Crazy Commie. I think I&#39;ll skip this one. Even though he was right about Ross, but he is nowhere near a Ross Perot or Ron Paul...but Trump is! Trump 2020I’m against socialism I’m more of a capitalism but 1000$/month Guy.Holy shit what...That’s one thing I have to say we have done right in the U.K. for once. Yeah the NHS isn’t great, but it’s free. I couldn’t imagine getting something like cancer and ending up selling my house to pay for treatment. To be honest America should be ashamed it hasn’t given free healthcare to its people yet. Just goes to show how money comes first before peoples well-being.The comments section is gonna be filled with angry conservatives lol. Get ready to see talking points like &quot;Venezuela, how are you gonna pay for it and we will never have socialism! (even though we already do.) <br /><br />Medicare For All, raising the minimum wage, tuition free college, taxing the rich, ending the phony wars on drugs and no war with Iran. Sign me up.Bernie should look Rogan in the eye when he&#39;s talking to him.. He glances but even when he&#39;s done, he doesn&#39;t often look up. Sorry but if you aren&#39;t confident enough in what you&#39;re saying to look someone in the eye when you&#39;re talking to them, how do you expect me to be convinced that you&#39;re making a sincere argument in which you truly believe?Mike Gravel endorsed Bernie earlier todayscroll up and get your own opinions before reading down here, imo.Hell ya. Good to see ya on Rogan&#39;s show Bernie!Bernie 2020 let’s go!Not even 5 minutes in and Bernie wants government to regulate TVI Bet when BernS  people said no drugs OR POT on the premises during the interview Joe said,   yes sir .Joe rogan is so much smarter than Bernie, Neanderthals for life brother!!!!!Socialism kills people<br /><b>Change my mind</b>I&#39;m listening now and I hope to god he ask him why he told his supporters to vote for Hillary last election after the bitch stole the nomination. My whole gripe with him. If you&#39;re not the nominee fuck the other person running. Ron Paul did it numerous times. He endorsed NO1 after he lost the nomination.Yang and Tulsi were better3 minutes in and I already have 1 &quot;free&quot;.... do I hear 2?!BOYNEEE SANDUHHHSHe should have mentioned what johann Harri said about decriminalisation of drugs, e.g. Switzerland and PortugalHere is how you deal with Healthcare. Make a Non-Profit, then have all those that want Socialism for Healthcare join in. There is your large Single Payers. Trump already wants to break down the barriers for across State Line Purchases. Leave us Americans who don&#39;t want it alone, and who will just keep voting to have it dismantled can have our own choice. It is our American Right to decide what to do with our body. No Government Forced Healthcare! There problem solved. Because I am a problem solver. You guys get a large Single Payer with massive Political Clout, and the Non-Profit can use the Government to Regulate Healthcare. If it is such a great thing, Americans can join in for X-number-of-years. See, side step this political bullshit and using Market Forces. Win-Win.Nooooooo no no nohohohoho what a fool absolute troglodyteBernie 2020. Clearly the best candidate, and one of the only ones that actually gives a shit about you.BERNIE &quot;THE COMMUNIST&quot; SANDERSFinally the Goat Bernie in the building!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bernie2020">#bernie2020</a>Bernie &quot;using taxes to actually help the middle and lower class instead of the 1% and their corporations&quot; Sandersthere is not a NATIONAL HC system in Canada, its provincialBernie Sanders can’t take on this power, he just wants to pretend like he has it over them by becoming president. There’s no controlling the 1% who truly run this country, not even with law.You divide the candidates have 2 nights no audience and you dedicate each “debate” to one topic for 2 hours. Then the next debate is a different topic for 2 hours etc.Please listen to this whole podcast. I applaud Joe tremendously for his platformI used to enjoy your show but since you turned to the jewwis side, you suck. Get yourself some tucks n a donut.....your going to need it. SHILLS !! 👹I hate how Bernie acts like he has the moral high ground. His platform is; free market bad, government good. That is not a moral high ground.Good fucking luck trying to take my gun, bitch. I’m a mother fucking law abiding citizen. I HAVE A GUN IN CASE A PSYCHOPATH LIK EL PASO BREAKS INTO MY HOUSE, fuck you Bernie.Vote Yang2020!!!!!I can&#39;t believe I can&#39;t believe it <br />I am 100% sure it&#39;s gonna broke the internetHow much is a living wage...$20 an hour?I didn’t get a notification that they went live.

My God people, get a fucking life.A socialist jew telling us how we should live while he drives around in a lambo and owns 3 houses across the country...<br /><br />Very rich...no pun intended.I’m mad Joe didn’t talk to Bernie about DMT aliens and human animal hybrids!!Tweeting is what we like bernie you fkn loser and joe keep sukin cok like you have for yrs pot is ruining you small mindJoe “I live in LA so I pretend to be liberal even though im die hard conservative “ RoganNo sir. Canadian health care is not as you describe. Won&#39;t even get into the long list of errors and misconceptions. It is likely better than what you got going on in the US but please.This comment section will be absolutely aids I’m calling itWtf!!Ever since Bernie invested in hemp/CBD his campaign money spending has tripled. He must be making $$ 💰<br />BOSTON HEMPIRE is the company he invested in. They sell CBD weed all over the United States. Genius business. Basically weed 😂😂ANDREW YANG GANGOnce again Mr.Rogan having more of an impact than the newsKyle Kulinski jerked off to this videoI fucking hate Bernie Sanders, and this podcast made me hate him more. Thanks Joe!Bernie &quot;Trust me, I&#39;ve met them at McDonald&#39;&quot; SandersI’ve been listening for 16 minutes sounds like Bernie Sanders Is full of shitI wish Joey Diaz was there to give Bernie a cookie 🍪TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸Now joe talked all that shit about bernie.

Good little socialist.Bernie has more hairs on his head than Trump has functioning brain cells. Bernie has great points based on realityCan’t wait to see how this podcast get shown to the masses. Will they say Rogan’s a white nationalist still or will he now be a libtard ?He&#39;s the cure to racism in America right now.Crazy Bernie!How does Joe land these interviews?

You blame lobbyists, but don’t say that they’re giving the money to the FUCKING POLITICIANS!!!<br /><br />This interview is just as softball, ass licking as that first Jack Dorsey interview. If you’re going to have cunts like this on, you need to prepare and make them actually EXPLAIN their position.I&#39;m a conservative, but I will listen to this with an open mind.Isn&#39;t TV nationalized in the UK and that&#39;s why they have to give candidates time or something like that?lol k ill give this a chanceI left a dislike because I want sanders interview to get ratioed.Dear god pls I hope we get a Bernie hitting the join gifRight off the bat: &quot;We should force all TV stations to provide free air time to ANYONE that wants to run for president.&quot; My god, he&#39;s dumb. lolWas going ok up until that timeline of doom shit.

I divorced her lolPOGInvite Andrew Yang again so he can bring a powerpoint.This guy is a CNN pundit at best.I couldn&#39;t be more proud to see the greatest pick for President on Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast. Bernie is the OG on nearly every other issue everyone else is running on.Joe! Kamala had several chances during and after the debate to respond to Tulsi’s charges. She didn’t and won’t.Nice to see the Russian trolls filling up the comments with salty tearsOh my fucking god. He actually did it, he had bernie sanders on his show after so many right wingers on his show talking shit on progressives and allowed bernie sanders to state, explain and defend his case. I have to give props to Joe on this.Give up all your shit so somehow everyone will have more shit.. don’t ask, it doesn’t have to make sense just vote don’t think about economics or passed socialist regimes.Fuck yeah!He sits like Larry King.  If he wants to lower corruption in DC, make lobbyists and campaign contributions illegal.  it&#39;s legalized bribery obviously, and Bernie&#39;s been playin the same game his whole career lol...Bernie is phony &amp; has sold us out by endorsing hillary will do again.

It is all determined by supply and demand, Bernie.I actually said &quot;what?&quot; out loud when I saw the guest. Not a particular fan, but just wow.Bernie is aiming for the wrong things, he is saying the drug companies this and that. Well attack the drug companies, dont screw with middle Americans insurance.I hope Joe will ask how Bernie feels being fucked over 4 years ago.Bernie &quot;Larry David&quot; SandersI don&#39;t know if i can watch this one. We should have no tolerance for Socialists.Crazy Bernie can&#39;t even look Joe in the eyes -- How&#39;s he going to rule the worlds strongest military?there are actually people who still think bernie has a chance lmaoWe love Bernie and Tulsi!!!fair play to this bloke, he wants to give you what we have... free healthcare! You need to vote this bloke in. ;)Health care is not a human right. It requires others to give their time and skills in order to heal you. The right that you have is to make better decisions on your health. Eat healthier and exercise. I shouldn’t have to pay higher  taxes because some idiot decided to eat cheap processed food and now has diabetes.Donald Trump wouldn&#39;t have the balls to sit across from Rogan for an hour.Not a fan of Sanders since he threw his weight behind Clinton, but glad to see him on JRE! Much better than some silly MSM soundbites.This guy is too old. Tulsi 2020.BERNIE SANDEHSGot my voteBernie’s solution to everything - the government can solve itDone with ya! Later gator!I need more then an hour JoeWhy does Bernie remind me of doc Emmett brown?If you want to fight corporate interests, the industrial military complex, etc. this man is your best chance. <br /><br />And if you let a few tweets tinged with identity politics get in the way of his solid policy, you need to check your prioritiesThis guy can&#39;t pick his head up....Kamara didn’t even care to respond LOLlol all those downvotes and you guys haven&#39;t even watched the whole thingBirkin sandals“In other countries”. F, there’s still a little bit of time left, Bernie, move there!  Gawd!Some of these comments are unfortunately proof of why we need to expand education in this country. The US education system has failed.It is a shame that this is so short.You jumped the 🦈keep this up Joe and the democrats are gonna start calling this election interferenceWHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Didn&#39;t see this coming.Awesome hopefully you will extend your platform for the current president to promote his campaign...lol bi partisan my ass joe your becoming a clown more and more as the days go by. Very sad.Forcing the media to do something....oh how socialist and facist that sounds 😆I wish Joe would get two candidates on and have them debate for hours.Holy fucking shitballsMany salty right wingers in the comments..August 6, 2019 is the day Joe Rogan solidified himself as the Podcast GOAT signed and stamped.now have Rand Paul on. PLEASE. or RonShit i wish this could have been a 3 hour conversation. Holy shit Bernie crushed it out of the park.joe &quot; this show is free&quot; roganI agree with Sanders in that what we have been seeing as of late are not debates. After watching 4 DNC &quot;debates&quot;, they more resemble an auction with other people&#39;s money.what the fuckMr. MagooPlease keep communism out of America....Make America Think Harder.... bye Bernie!I really hope we get to see Bernie Sanders meet Sernie Banders.The day this commie dies will be a great day.Bernie runs until he gets a check. ✔ and drops out every time.Hindsight is 2020<br /><br />Sanders for Presidentim gunna watch this, but i have to make the joke. did he figure out how to get out of the shower properly?Fuck yeah. Thanks for this Joe &amp; Bernie! I&#39;d love more guests like this.FIRSTI’ll be honest, I’m going to give this a shot, everybody deserves a chance in conversation.  From a libertarian.Hey Bernie, have you ever tried D.M.T?The reality of Canada is far from what he just said. Ask a Canadian citizen how long and how many hoops you must jump through to get treatment.Work for your own money, you don&#39;t get mine.Whaaaaat? Fuckin yessss!my presidentHoly fuck.Don&#39;t agree with Bernie but every but seeing a normal conversation between two people is not the norm these days. Joe does a good service no matter who he has on.Rogan wants to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FeelTheBern">#FeelTheBern</a>Bernie bent the knee to Hillary and the DNC in 2016 despite being blatantly betrayed by them. Strike one. <br /><br />Bernie flips to identity politics for 2020 in order to gain activist votes from the Left. Strike two. <br /><br />Bernie preaches socialism, yet is a millionaire with three houses...<br /><br />And that&#39;s the game. Spineless hypocrites, thy name is SANDERS.1.2k dislikes 15 minutes after upload. either, everyone watches at 4x speed, or you guys aren&#39;t actually open to new ideas.Joe Rogan for president.

Stop comparing us to Canada, Bernie. They have 37 million people living there. The top 10% earners in the US pay 90% of the taxes in the USA with a population of 327 million people. It&#39;s impossible to fund health car with those numbers. Spend less in the government if you want to fund health care for the citizens of the USFiring this up r/n, not sure if I can take Bernie&#39;s nail on a chalkboard voice for the next hour, but we will see.How sweet would trump be on this! Or better yet, Alex Jones and trump!Hell yea Bernie 2020Joe Rogan for presidentI just got 6% more jewishNOIs it me ?????? Or does bernie sound like THE BUTCHER FROM GANGS OF NEW YORK ????🤣🤣As a swede to hear about your healthcare it baffles me that you don&#39;t have free healthcare. Damn...Now get TRuMp on&quot;I think food lines are a good thing&quot;-BernThe thumbnail even has Bernie’s signature hand movement lolPetition to get Sean Evan&#39;s on JRE...NO JOE!!I’m not a fan of Bernie, but it’s amazing that Joe can communicate with everyone.Yeh, it was pretty good. Leave it to Joe to get in there.First, it was Elon to Feel the Burn. Now we all Feel the Bern. Thanks Joe. You are a gentleman and a scholar.I did a double-take when I read the titleThis is the one place I hoped this show would not go. No matter what party. I watch joe to get away from the noise. No more. I’m out. Thanks Joe for all the entertainment.Bernie doesn&#39;t know how Canada works. He is a retard for failing to notice how impossible it is to bring a lawsuit against healthcare providers in Canada.Get a clue, commie!Love Bernie, and great questions Joe!JRE debates after individual podcasts with each candidate. It will be the futureWOah burnie the communist is hereHow in the fuck is Joe Rogan doing a better job of spreading the message of presidential candidates than MSM in their debates? DNC should just give up in MSM and give Joe a debate to moderate tomorrow.Love itNewsflash you aren&#39;t guaranteed other people labor or efforts, nor is it or Right if someone else has to put forth an effort.Americans are so heinously stupid, how can you call him crazy Bernie for wanting to give you free healthcare. You spend £600bn a year on pointless defence. You are so blinded by the lobbying that goes on politically it&#39;s not even funny. America &lt; Europe.Uh oh, Rogan&#39;s gonna get it for this one....Joe needed to ask about his direct involvement in the $200 million EB-5 scam in VT that he promoted....And his wifes corruption as well...Anyone who hustles their ass off and produces gets screwed under Bernie&#39;s ideas. No thanks.Do I get free stuff from Bernie for listening to him for nearly 68 minutes? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />BWHAHA just kidding obviously we all get everything free and he&#39;ll make it work completely rhetorical question.not a fan of Bernie, my name says it allOh shit. Trump next podcast.Joe Rogan uploads and SpaceX is live sending a rocket. Nice timing.He evaded the question of why lobbying exists. <br /><br /><br />The truth is, lobbying is a right that all people have, and average people help create non-profits which lobby for those people&#39;s interests.Get him to toke on a joint, then watch Bernie surge past Biden.<b>The problem is, he doesn’t want to fix the current system, he wants to renew. Which will cut out certain participants. Gaining control on the other side, Again... not for the people. But likely his own pocket.</b>Wat!!!  Wat!!!!! 😁y you outdid yourself this time, Rogan. Bravo!!!👏I love how it&#39;s always some upper class activist who proclaims himself as the hero of the working class. Advocating for policies that would hurt us. <br /><br />Why can&#39;t there be a true working man fighting for us? I&#39;m tired of these elites trying to pander and say they fight for us.Bernie doesn’t mention you could wait to 6 months waiting for a surgeon cause they don’t think it’s important enough to fix it then due to lack of doctors. Sorry Bernie what will you do about fixing that problem. I love ya Bernie, but find out the whole story.Where’s Kanye...?As an Australian, the highlight of this is watching you yanks tee off on each other in the comments section.Honestly, if Joe had every candidate do an episode his viewers would be making a more educated decision than they would by listening to the presidential debates. Conversations like this gives people a chance to hear each candidate thought process, pause, and fact check. LolI&#39;m from U.K....Bernie is talking out his ass.....There no law here in uk that says you have to let a politician speak for an allotted amount of time...On the contrary....Our news media are even more biased than CNN and will constantly interrupt you and strawman you... Especially if you&#39;re right wing.Socialism is for figsnot even murcan, just here to see the inbred trump loving hicks try to string together angry sentencesright wing snowfalkes with the dislikes...<br />...as always...Bernie 2020!Guess what? All the money the Big companies lobby with is paid for by Taxes. Think about itFeel the bern!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not this moron!LOL Bernie needs a combGo home old crabBURN THAT MIC HE GOT LITTLE BOY LIQUIDS ALL OVER ITThe real answer is there is no status quo, there shouldn&#39;t beMindless cucks disliking again!<br />I&#39;m proud of you and your predictability.Anything that requires the labor of another is NOT a right.........Joe, if you could some how get Donald Trump on your show - I think it would be the most watched YouTube video ever. <br /><br />I would definitely love to see your no nonsense interview technique up against Donald Trump!It’s crazy how when I white guy does a massacre they say he has mental illness like wtf ! Now out a sudden he’s mental illness come on .Fuck Bernie Sanders!! What a waste of time to actually listen to what this socialist prick has to say!! You really gave him a platform???I&#39;m glad to see Joe do this. I have a feeling I may not have ever heard some of this information, nor would some of his viewers.Do your presidents have like a minimum age requirement? Like almost dead?it&#39;s socialism or barbarism folksAre these not live anymore? My notifications suckNobody:<br /><br />Joe Rogan: So Bernie, have you tried DMT?Wait WhaaaaaatBernie!lol, WHAT??plz get trump onLike him or hate him he is repeating stupid comments. Just like his issue on healthcare, because if the argument is that healthcare is a basic human right, then what about housing or food? You fucking need shelter and food LONG before you need fucking healthcare but if you bring this up people are jumpy on it. Give everyone free shelter and free food.. oh wait that cant work? Then why the fuck do you think free healthcare can work? Most people from other countries come to the US for surgeries and treatments because their free healthcare sucks ass..This is why joe is the best, I&#39;m more conservative but I appreciate the fact he has ALL types of viewpoints on his show, censorship is an evil we should all fightIT&#39;S HAPPENINGFree stuff!<br />Yeah but who pays?<br />You do.All I can’t think is “pudding “ 😂<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a>Joe.. <br />Did Bernie ask to come on your show or did you guys ask him to come on your show?(if so, when?)Joe Hogan is a real American.can joe rogan make a unofficial political debate, even if its just democratsMy dad lives in Canada and the health care sucks.No longer watching JREI just clicked this and I’m 5 seconds in hoping and praying to god joe has some balls in this interview.HAVE TRUMP ON!!!!It’s pretty obvious, let joe rogan interview each candidate, most thumbs up runs for president!<br />Problem solved! 😂👍All the inbred cousin banging Trumpets are going crazy on the dislike button right now 🤣🤣My dislike has nothing to do with you Joe. Love youYyyeeeeeeeesssssssss!Bernie is a joke get realI&#39;m just here for all the assblasted conservativesWho&#39;s fact checking this commie?We here in Germany redistribute much much more than the US does. Trust me, we are not a socialist paradise. If we didn’t have a strong medium-sized, family-owned company structure, we wouldn’t even have a lot to redistribute. It’s not about getting stuff to people. It’s about people getting the stuff themselves. And that issue has not yet been solved by socialism or communism. You also end up destroying families when you take away the need to make responsible and reasonable decisions in your life.About a fist from your face there BernieWell done Joe, had mixed feeling before clicking playBernie Sanders, super loud since 1941Bernie is the next president sorry Trumpwow .....now u gotta get the president ONThanks for having Bernie.  Great interview.  Medicare and Education should be a right for all Americans.   Tagging every policy of Bernie’s as socialist is disingenuous.Is it Bernie Sanders interview or his shoulders 🤔?The united states healthcare is wonderful, no child with anything moderately serious condition gets treated, any law abiding well meaning adult also gets treatment. Yes everything costs a lot of money but it costs money to have great healthcare. Some things should definitely change, I agree but the problem is the drug companies, nail the drug companies for getting everyone hooked on opiates, sue the drug companies for everything they have and use that but if you give everyone healthcare I&#39;m going to have to pay for it and I dont even have healthcare myself. The middle class will get screwed in this deal for sure.The first 12% of the last 10% of the last 7% of the first 16% of the last 8% of the first 1% should smoke DMTYo what the fuck this is awesomeYAAYYYYYY MORE GOVERNMENT CONTROL! If the government can’t fix your roads properly and in a timely manner, then they sure as hell can run our healthcare!10 years ago Bernie Sanders was given a choice...Weak. Get Trump <i>and</i> Alex on together.Joe...great work sir...havent even watched interview yet, but thx for having bernie on!Be spitting  straight facts😎😎😎😎Get Donald trump on the podcast.

After 3 years and finally getting mad at my doctor, she told me I had liquid in my mastoid. I was in for tinnitus that still prevents me from sleeping. Put 2 and 2 together.

MARIJUANA IS OBVIOUSLY A BIG ISSUE”He’s going to end up opening a can of worms with having both Bernie and tulsi. This will set a precedent of probably trump and Biden coming on. It’s going to be a wild 2020. Who would have thought 9 years ago or whatever the shiny happy jihad guy would have presidential candidates on his podcast influencing culture 😬Bernie is trashEarthquake is gonna hit San Fransico. HAARP look it up and wake up.Joe can seriously just invite all the candidates and do a long form conversation. Fuck the debatesTrue to form, the JRE episode featuring Bernie is free to all.One hour is not enough!&quot;White people dont know what its like to be poor&quot; - bernie lolSocialism badThe old guy has a hard time looking Joe in the eye,  Red Flag!! Big timeOnly an hour man?HOLY SH    -  -    IT how does he do it?  Joe Rogan and Bernie EFFIN Sanders!Every candidate should have to do long form podcasts like this. We learn more about them than the stupid debates.I can’t imagine this voice leading our nation for 4 years.Opening up talking about the constraints of time in debates-on an excellent medium to have a debate-  I can&#39;t count the amount of times I wish the guest on here had a mildly intellectual opponent there to call out the glaringly obvious lies coming out of their mouth.Bernie is an ASMR dream if you&#39;re a socialist. Bernie. Please stop whispering.LMAO... I&#39;m only 20 seconds in but, is Joe doing low key Bernie impersonations while talking to Bernie!? I swear he just did it like, twice in 20 seconds.

How about that he promises mandatory $15 minimum wage, yet didn&#39;t pay his campaign staff $15 until a few weeks ago, then cut their hours as a result? Bernie is such a hypocrite. No thanks on the whole socialism thing...Ohhhhh shit here we go !The problem with drug prices has nothing to do with negotiating with drug companies. 100% of the reason that they can set their own prices is because of our patent laws. A drug company CEO admitted as much. A pill that sells in Australia for $8 sells here for something like $2,000, or whatever the absurdly high number is. When asked why, the drug company CEO said, &quot;Because it&#39;s still protected under patent here. In Australia, there is a generic version available.&quot; Don&#39;t keep them under patent protection for so long, and prices will come down faster, sooner.WhoooaBernie “ I have the intellect of a fruit fly with Down syndrome “ SandersThe video has been up 15 minutes and there are already over 1500 dislikes, I think that says a little about Americas and there ability to listenTrump 2020!!!why didn&#39;t OBAMA CARE SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS!!!  lies and more liesNot a fan of bernie, but good on you for having him.

The guy whose job has been to be apart of his own political sabotage since 2016. Capitalism for the Win ! ✌🤑 . . .Bernie and JoRo need to have an ayahuasca ceremony togetherBERNIE HAS AT LEAST FIVE CHILDREN LOCKED IN HIS BASEMENT RIGHT NOWOne hour and seven minutes, how much of these video you cut out young Jamie?I tweeted this a few days ago but holy shit, it&#39;s getting worse lol. Bernie has spent so much time shrugging when asked about how he plans to pay for all of his plans that his shoulders are now fused to the back of his head. That ain&#39;t healthy, Bernie.  <br /><br />Also, Canada has universal healthcare and it&#39;s a shitshow. Waiting months or even a year or more to see a doctor, astronomically long waits at the ER, and the only way to have speedier &amp; better healthcare is to pay for it.  Definitely don&#39;t want that in America.  I&#39;ve lost basically all respect for Bernie &amp; most of the democrats running for office, but I wanted so badly to be able to listen to him talk to Joe but I just can&#39;t do it. At least not in one sitting. He&#39;s just talking nonsense.It&#39;s really exciting to see Bernie on the show!Dope. I&#39;ve been hoping for this for so long.please have Ron PaulThis is where the debates should take place.Fox News told me everything here is a lie.get TRUMP and killary on here also please!We get it, you hate the United States of America and you’re still butt hurt about the blue wave flushing itself down the toilet. Meanwhile, Donald J.Trump, 45th President of the United States of America, has only contributed to record low unemployment, record high employment amongst minorities, AA business ownership +400%, achieved 3% GDP within 1 year, 4.1% GDP in ‘18, stock market is up $6T, record high DOW growth(6000+ in one year), $5T+ back into our economy, $89B worth of regulations abolished, TPP/Paris Accord abolished, record number of Pedophiles and Human Traffickers jailed in 2017 and 2018, more sex criminals and pedophiles arrested in the past two years than the entire previous decade, created commissions for opioids addiction/child trafficking/voter fraud, millions of jobs created, illegal immigration down 50%, denuclearization of Korea, democratic corruption coming to light every single day(FISA Abuse/FusionGPS/Uranium One Indictment/HCF funded Russia dossier/Podesta child porn/DNC nomination bought and sold/$400M channeled from Russia to HCF)Damn atleast listen to the whole thing before you start shitting on the guyBernie Sanders is hilarious to me. He reminds me of the grandpa from the Disney movie “UP”😂Feel the BernIt finally happened.

I&#39;m doneThis was short but sweet. Good job Bernie comrades!Wahooooooooo, well done Joe!Bernie&#39;s &quot;experts&quot; will tell you Canada&#39;s healthcare quality is &quot;as good or better&quot; than the US? lol, 🆗 sure Bernie. Meanwhile, actual Canadians will tell you it sucks to wait months for healthcare and have to deal with the crappy government-run single-payer system.  Actual Canadians interviewed about it ➡️ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2jijuj1ysw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2jijuj1ysw</a>   So much so, those who can afford to do so, use the more costly private healthcare alternatives which at least Canadians have as an option but Bernie would outlaw here!. Why are they more costly? Because it is expensive to do healthcare well. And it&#39;s your life that is at stake, so those who can would prefer to pay for quality care.Wherever you look the United States public are a cash cow for the corporate elite.Over spending, overeating, overdosing, more more more, all you can eat. The only place you can find cheap fast food and insanely high insulin prices...BERNIE FUCKING SANDERS!!!! LOVE THAT MAN!BOOOOOOO!!! You stinkBernie lost my respect, he was a good candidate and I would have 100% voted for him, but he lost his spine, supported Hillary, wants to open the countries birders, give healthcare to non-citizens, and hopped on the &quot;Trump&#39;s a racist orange man bad&quot; train.

And loves to kill unborn babies especially unborn black babies. <br />Shame on you joe you fucking piece of scumBernie talking about the DNC giving candidates a fair shot is hilariousHoly shit, it Bernie Sanders!How the FUCK was this only an Hour long...Bernie would burn up the first 2 years of a Presidency. Look how they all have aged from the time they are Inaugurated to the time they are done, does not matter 4 or 8.Next is Biden.<br />Biden to Rogan: Nice to meet you Hulk HoganF<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CK">#CK</a> YEAH!!!!!!!!!!Love you BernieSprained my index finger puppet clicking so fast. I’ll be sending my hospital bill to Young Jamie shortly.You need to get trump on. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MAGA2020">#MAGA2020</a>Okay, here&#39;s the problem with &quot;free&quot; out-of-pocket healthcare: In America, we pay doctors and nurses a LOT of money. In Canada where healthcare is free, they have opened up a new problem: Nobody wants to be in the medical field because they make a lot less. I&#39;m not saying healthcare shouldn&#39;t be cheaper, but if we try to make it &quot;free&quot; with higher taxes, then we&#39;ll open up a whole new can of worms and have more of a doctor shortage than we already do and I have yet to hear Bernie Sanders address this.I don’t want to write for 20 minutes so here is a video explaining why American healthcare is superior, more superior than Europe and Canada.. our facts and statistics prove it.. <br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/Lr1fXOSpIj8">https://youtu.be/Lr1fXOSpIj8</a>I’m a conservative but I’m still gonna listen to this nut jobugh......... stop that nonesense talk about universal healthcare/healthcare for all. bro, the countries that have, the SYSTEM BROKE DOWN. waiting times for appointments rise up into extremes, hospitals get privatised, standards are lowering, and people wish they can afford private healthcare because there they MIGHT get faster appointments or better treatment but it&#39;s still not guaranteed. Oh yeah, not even mentioning how the bloody taxrates for healthcare have skyrocketed.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieOrBust">#BernieOrBust</a> this man is the only person who will bring real change.Holy shit!Feel the Bern ( OF THE DMT, THE DMT, THE DMT!)I made a Bernie Debunked video.  The guy is a complete fraud, here&#39;s the proof, from his own mouth:  (It&#39;s worse than you think)  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDhiJVeaung">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDhiJVeaung</a><br />I don&#39;t mind Joe giving this fool a mic, I just wish he&#39;d dare to challenge his socialist bullshit.AWESOMEThanks for this but I’m still voting YANGI liked Andrew Yang but damn do I need health care! I haven’t been to a doctor since I was on my parents insurance like a decade ago. I need it! Just to get a vagina check up once in a while and affordable birth control!The podcast has been up for 11 minutes it’s over an hour long and already heavily disliked. Why not try listening first and then forming an opinion based on what you’ve heard? So many closed minded people here... you ever hear of DMT?I&#39;ve lived in Canada all my life.  You don&#39;t get to choose any doctor you like because so many people have coverage that we all fight to find the one doctor accepting new patients.  My pregnant wife waited two months to get a Meet and Greet with a doctor.  The care is atrocious.  They rush us in and out the door as fast as they can and we end up with rushed service and you often have to get 2nd and 3rd opinions that confirm the 1st doctor was incorrect.   Do not listen to Sanders on healthcare.  He&#39;s as much a fraud as any other.Bernie is unironically the only Democrat candidate who&#39;s against open borders and increased immigration, he&#39;s the most sensible choice. Too bad he doesn&#39;t have a chanceI wonder if Bernie watched the videos of joe making fun of him before he came on haha I wishbernie is a racistWhispering Bernie is sexy Bernie.Fucking commie IS after our hard earned money. I hope he&#39;s offended! Healthcare is NOT a human right. Sorry Comrade Bernie!BERNIE 2020Bernie Sanders voice “The 1%”Healthcare is not a right. It&#39;s a combination of commodities and services. Be gone commiebernie sanders should kill himselfGET A LOAD OF THIS SOCIALIST. I will win in 2020. Win bigly. Believe me.This motherfucker owns multiple housesBut.. but..

Burn one with Bernie; I want to hear about the alien lizard people.<br /><br /><br />Bernie is full of shit, by the way. He wants your shit so he can give out shit for free.Good to see him on here allowed to speak at some length. I disagree with him on most of the things he said, but it was good to hear it at length.I love Joe, but I can&#39;t watch this liver spotted old commie for 5 seconds.<b>Bernie Wants Babies Ripped To Pieces... While Saying People On Death Row Should Be Allowed To Vote... Just Shows His Supporters Are Full Blown Psychopaths Just Like Their Cult Leader</b>In other countries state television is much bigger and thus politicians can easily be assigned major airtime.

Total piece of a shit communist.Does he expect everyone to forget what happen last time he ranMan that guy is boring as fuck .. he need some lsdFuck BernieTypical retardarian morons in the comment section who think they have a patent on understanding economics while believing some of the silliest utopian nonsense that isn’t even anywhere near close to what can be considered rational.Socialism will work this time…This podcast is going to get censored by the mainstream left...I’m a trump voter but i’m gonna watch this whole thing.

C&#39;mon man....we all know you&#39;re a liberal but now you&#39;ve joined the machine (the mainstream media, Google, FB, IG, TWITTER, YouTube and the rest of them) who are all interfering with the not only the election but with the manipulation of what people are allowed to think, see and say.  Bad move bro, bad...bad move.  You&#39;ve truly exposed yourself as a Hollywood, left of left cuck.  Sad day.Dude doesnt even pay his workers $15 an hour.Yeah Bernie, let’s pass legislation to force a broadcast company, a private company, to give free air time to the State so the candidates can spread their propaganda. How very authoritarian of you$15 an hour will be beautiful! Our Dollar is already collapsing, might as well fight for 1 million dollars an hour minimum wage. Dumbass socialistsLol Bernie is trash n a fraud.oh godIs dmt included in the healthcare plan??Why not allow people access to healthy food instead of shoving health care medicine down their throatSo did Rogan get Bernie to smoke a blunt like he did to me?Pull that sucker close to you Bernie. You wanna keep it about about a raised fist from your face.Have not been this hyped about a new JRE since anytime I see a new Joey Diaz one. No idea how people label joe as right wing when he has people from each end of the spectrum on.people think he wants to take their money? it literally said on his website he would tax people that make 50k a year a extra 5k on top of what they already pay in taxesNeat to see him on here, still a kook though.Bernie: but other countries <br /><br />Bro, this is America!! We’re on top of so many things!! Capitalism brings more people out of poverty to filthy rich than any other system!Imho There should never be a bernie sanders interview unless ron paul gets to sit in.Fuck Joe Rogan. He&#39;s demonstrated over and over he&#39;s nothing than an ignorant fool shilling for communist rule.YES!!!!!Can&#39;t wait to watch this &lt;3Trash.Fuck yes.Bernie Sanders is on! I don&#39;t agree with the guy but I gotta respect thispodcasts like this are better live because that way large amounts can&#39;t be edited out  without someone knowing  which seems to happen every time a guest mentions financial thingsWoah, big surprise.No you banned automatics you idiot not ar15<a href="http://alienmikeoc.com/">Alienmikeoc.com</a>-Ban assault weapons <br />-Yeah but have you ever seen complex geometric patterns made out of love, Bernie?Yanggang!just here for the maggats comments 😅Replace the debates with a round table discussion with just the candidates and no crowdHe’s a white guy. He won’t be elected by Democrats lolLike this if you have a lil wienerThey give candidates &quot;free&quot; time on the BBC because its a nationalised channel that all tax payers pay for so they are given the right to see their candidates!THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN A SOCIALIST IS A DEAD SOCIALIST!!!!!Can’t wait for rogan’s trump interviewOpen borders and free stuff......how does that work?Fuck is going on!!   Here at your service a real biblical prophet. Bow down to the power and sensory perception from datura.It’s happening! It’s happeningHOLY SHIT HE DID IT1k dislikes lmao&#39;I want a hundred and fourwty percent tax rate and white people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor&#39;Hey Bernie how about the drug and low income problems in your state?He is a bumbling buffoon!Lol baaaahhhaaaahaaa come onEvery day I wake up and thank god Bernie Sanders is not the president.BeautifulTULSI FOR THE WINAny other guest<br />&#39;yeah just pull that microphone closer, like a fist away&#39;<br />For bernie<br />&#39;let&#39;s pull that microphone closer&#39;<br />Continues to push it for bernie<br />Joe is clearly a socialist by his display of weaknessBernie didn&#39;t pay his own employees $15 an hour and when they made him pay them 15 he cut their hours and fired people. it&#39;s simple economics people. If I have $100 an hour to pay people and I&#39;m paying 10 people at $10 an hour and the minimum wage forces me to pay them $15 I have to let go of 5 people. So it actually hurts the people more than you even know. And let&#39;s say the business owner needs all 10 people to stay afloat. Now by forcing business owners to pay 15 you inadvertently raise unemployment and kill fragile businesses on the verge of dying.Oh shitI bet 98% of the down votes are just because it&#39;s Bernie Sanders.He should have had Crowder doing Bernie instead(((Bernie (((socialist))) Sanders)))Precz z czerwona zaraza!This episode comment section should be avoided. It’s going to be toxic conversationHealthcare is already guaranteed to all. This guy is a dope and a liar.This guy won’t even live through his first term smhThe platform should be free.... it’s our America after all and it’s the reason we are left behindHoly moly. YESSSSS!!!!😍😍Still not better than Andrew Yang ... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yang2020">#yang2020</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>This fkn piece of shit. Fkn joeBREAKING: Alex Jones receives second command from Jesus to destroy Joe RoganThis guy has my voteA lot of brain dead conservatards who are coprophiliacs for the rich in the comments, not surprising.Here for all the people who cant define socialism telling me how its the worst thing in the world.Bernie has already admitted that if he is elected that yes, in fact, everyone&#39;s taxes will necessarily go up, In part, to pay for health care for illegal immigrantsRight off the bat. Healthcare is absolutely NOT a human right. You do not have the right to anyone else’s services. A country or state can vote to provide healthcare through taxation. But that doesn’t make it a right. The fundamental misunderstanding of rights is what is most alarming about Bernie and many others as well.Bernie still hasnt realized government provided services are not “free”Politics is in everything. It’s just a word people use to refer to the process of getting literally ANYTHING done in any form of civilization. It’s not bleeding into you’re podcasts, it’s bleeding into everything because this is the real world where grown ups occasionally discuss reality.Really don&#39;t like Bernie but I applaud Joe for having him on.The debates are a joke right now. Bernie is not even the furthest left candidate.Please get Peter schiff back on the podcast instead.  I like my politics and policy discussions with a strong bias towards rich business owners wants and needs. Not this socialist shit that&#39;s biased towards gross icky working people.Oh shit things got real<b>It&#39;s Bernie Sanders but most importantly no black people on this podcast! Keep it up Joe!</b>Really take this in: A conversation with a comedian/pothead/MMA-commentator is gonna have more impact than the official televised debates....<br /><br />What a time to be alive!I&#39;m impressedBernie &quot;People used to laugh at Ross Perot&quot; SandersWithin the first 3 minutes <br /><br />Joe: Do you think you could convince the TV networks to give you free airtime?<br /><br />Bernie: No, you would have to pass legislation to make them do that.<br /><br />And that’s how socialism works.Thank you Joe!Rogan Throwing SoftballsAudios brokenI live in Quebec Canada, the most socialist province of Canada. Taxes are 50% and are roads are terrible, enjoy!I am from Canada, Our Health Care is shit. Ive been waiting 4 months for a specialist so before ya go on about about how great the quality of care is could you please go into detail about why you think that?The trully sad part is that he&#39;s too old...Ben Shapiro and Bernie Sanders  drbate on JRE!!Naaahh. I&#39;ll pass this :<br /><br /><br />Like most recent JRE&#39;s I&#39;ll let this pass...Bernie is a fucking idiot put him in a homeWhen you gonna get Trump on?😂😂 Bernie wants free time on networks, who are expected to just give up entire primetime timeblocks, losing all that revenue. Literally everything he wants is a handout. Nothing&#39;s free. Either the government would have to subsidize those timeslots via taxpayer money or the networks would be forced to lose the revenue of those timeblocks that would normally come from advertizers. Just because &quot;other countries&quot; do it. Yes, other liberty-deprived socialist hellholes. 💀💀No fucking way finallllyyyyyUnions have spent 22 times the amount of money on lobbying during that same time span lolMy two favorite people in the universe.2 minutes in and I&#39;m already sure not many important questions were askedBernie ya like dick and balls? You like deals and business? CBT?Bernie ‘DMT for all’ SandersBernie Sanders is what this country deseves. The middle class has been in submission for decades now. We bailed out the auto industry, wallstreet and added trillions to the dept to give billionaires more tax cuts while they buy back their stocks, invest in automation and still ship jobs overseas. The American people even spilled blood when we fight the elites useless and pointless wars. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!!  BAIL OUT THE MIDDLE CLASS💪Whaaaaaaaatttttt????!!!! Yeah baby! America’s Dad Bernie Sanders!Get Richard Spencer on!He has my vote.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23med4all">#med4all</a>bernie will always be top jewFuck this Gulag lazy piece of shit.Much socialism. wow.WhaaaaatttJust a reminder to all the people that are going to shit talk and support their corporate approved candidates and/or orange presidents; Bernie Sanders has the courage to come to Joe Rogan’s podcast and be asked hard hitting real questions and explain his platform to Joe’s audience. Did they have that courage or did they run of Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC to answer safe corporate-approved softballs? <br /><br />Exactly.Not radical.....smhTrump2020! ;)Big Guy!!!Bernie look 120 years oldI love this guy&#39;s extra crispy chicken.:-)The UK has state media, which EVERY citizen MUST pay for through their taxes.  It&#39;s NOT free, jackass.I felt the bernraises min wage to $15 cant afford to pay, reduces hours<br /><br /><br />media are blaming Trump for the shooting, ignoring the Dayton shoot was a far-leftist  radicalised by all this left wing media like buzzfeed and dangerous rhetoric such as concentration campsI love you Joe, but are you willing to offer all candidates the same opportunity? Or have you opened Pandora’s box and did your part in skewing the process? Difficult times, hard decisions. 😳This is what we call Big Brain time<b>FUCK the Communist ideas and policies that Bernie Sanders has</b>Bernie is here to break the matrix 👀This is awesome!5 minutes in, Old Red is already spewing his bullshit propaganda. INSUFFERABLEFuck this socialist who wants to tax everyoneThis guy is an idiot, trump is already setting up a system so we can by medication from CanadaBernie was my guy in 2016, Yang is now my guy for 2020, better policy and ideas.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yanggang">#yanggang</a>The only guest Joe has ever adjusted the mic himself for😳😳😳 W O W 😳😳😳.Mad props to Joe for having one of the few politicians that aren’t bought out.It should be a requirement for every candidate to appear on the podcastIts NOT law in the U.K. to let people speak.<br />News channels are basically propaganda machines the same as yours.Those that live in Canada go across the border to America for their Dr.  The drug prices in America is why Trump signed the bill to import cheaper drugs.  Bernie isn&#39;t rich enough to not be paid off.  Wonder who is blackmailing him.Joe might fuck around and get thanos on his podcast.<br /><br />Joe: so why do you want erase have the population <br /><br />Thanos: see the thing is joe....Lol oh no! <b>How retahded is dis goina ghet?</b>What&#39;s up with joe and having commies onMy Father has had bypasses 17 years aprt and never spent more then a weeek if not just 5-6 days  not a month?Even though I completely disagree with his policies and political views this was hella interesting.. he actually made some good pointsA lot of Bernie haters. It works both ways, guys. Radical left-wingers, mainstream &#39;&#39;woke&#39;&#39; scolders and left identitarians really need to stop calling everyone a nazi, racist &amp; sexist all the time. But, conservatives should stop with the nonsense that any progressive policy = equal to communism. Both are insane and untrue, both are counterproductive. Tribalism is the real mind-killer. Challenge your own beliefs, be a critical thinker, regardless of your ideology.He needs to be in a fourth home. An old people&#39;s one...Finally Rogan is starting to actually listen to the real left instead of simply parroting right wing talking points that he&#39;s picked up from his right-wing friends.Im in.🎧You should have had Jimmy Dore sit in on this one, Joe. Bernie has dogged Jimmy for 2 years straight because he knows he&#39;ll ask him actual questions.Vermont is drug infested and not rural you IDIOTWowHoly shit it&#39;s Bernie Sanders on jreSandders and the 4 horsemen of the congress wamans are the most dangerous thing to this country.<br />Socialist pig dogs!

I waited 11 hours in the emergency waiting room with my pregnant wife who was having serious abdomen pain. Almost 12 hours to see a doctor. Our health care is a fucking joke. People go to the US from canada for a reason for health careHealth care in the UK is not accesable to all, it usually has a waiting list of 4-8 years for OAP&#39;s who have to get in line and suffer serious pain and illness ! If you have less serious conditions you can be refussed treatment . Dont listen to this man it doesnt work !This is going  to be as funny as the Alex Jones one.This is going  to be as funny as the Alex Jones one.Good talk, though I still have no respect for Bernie. should have just lit one and said we should do some DMTThis is gonna be fucking hilarious I can&#39;t wait to watch this.Watching JRE dont feel the same no more /:Bernie Sanders is a badassYo what is going on Bernie on JRE?!Ahhhhhhhh it&#39;s just a Republican talking pointsOh my god it actually happened.Joe Rohan is the greatest interviewer of all time.

This guy is insane.I&#39;m good, I rather sweep the sidewalkI think the problem conservatives have with Bernie’s healthcare plan is that you have to force doctors to work for very low pay.wtf joeOh nice the crypt keeper, I love tales from the crypt!Never had a real  job, no Military service  but wants to lead our Country.“I blame the media to some extent”, wow, so fake news is at least partially true? This is why outlets like JRE are eclipsing traditional media outlets.the system is so dysfunctional because some of the health care networks are getting up to $100 million per mentally ill opioid addicted person ...free public healthcare will eliminate all that plus balanced the federal budgetTrump 2020🇺🇸You animals dont deserve BernieIncluding Alex Jones would have won the internet.I was not expecting this whatsoever but the episode of JRE has really made my day at least so far I&#39;m only like 6 or 7 mins into the episode.Joe will never have a republican on his show...My 45 is semi auto gonna take that you fkn loserThe money drug companies spend on reaserch is never mentions.His polices sound great until you realize you can&#39;t do that when you promote open borders!Holly fucking shieeeeeeeeet son...&quot;When you&#39;re white, you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be living in a ghetto. You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor. You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.&quot;  -Bernie Sanders, 2016Love this manAll the edgy libertarians/trumpsters gonna let us know how little they understand common policies such as universal health care.WHATGet Ron Paul in there already!!!Feel the Bern &lt;3<b>Pretty sure this&#39;ll be his lowest viewed podcast</b>Joe &quot;you need DMT my friend&quot;Holy shit man!am i the only one who doesnt trust a multimillionaire socialist?Didn&#39;t see this comingShortest JRE of all time.

Annoying afOh look it&#39;s Crazy Bernie, let&#39;s hear what socialist plans he is talking about today.Damn is joes compound haunted ??Get tulsi on here next that would be interestingGreat to see Senator Sanders on JRE. Bernie 2020!IMMEDIATELY FRIGGEN CLICKEDOmgD  M  TI like Bernie as a person but his socialist policies will ruin this country.James Adomian’s finest performance. 👏Bernie Sanders is such a dipshit especially when he said white people don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be poor and he&#39;d be fine with a 100% federal income tax increase. More white people live below the poverty line in this country than any other group of people and the last thing we need is more federal income tax taken out of our paychecks. Not to mention this guy thought it would be okay to hold gun manufacturers liable for deaths in shootings that their brand of firearm was used in. This guy wasn&#39;t even employed until the age of 40.If the guest would have been a Bernie&#39;s intern, he/she would have made less than U$15.I like the way Bernie speaks quietly never heard him like thisIm excited for this.I think I like Tulsi bestFucking commieFuck yeaaaaaaaaWho&#39;s here before the million?Rogan&#39;s first question: &quot;Do you get frustrated by the time-constraints of the debates?&quot; Bernie: &quot;Absolutely!...&quot;<br />- Then why is this podcast only 1hr 8 mins long??Fuck this socialist pile of fucking shit .What Bernie Leaves Out of Healthcare:<br /><br />The average wait time in Canada for a surgery is 20 weeks... Cardiovascular: 8.4 weeks.<br />Last year there were more than 1 million people waiting for surgeries across Canada.. an all time high... there is 33 million people in the Canada. That&#39;s 3% of the population. <br />Translate that to a population 10 times that amount in the United States and its 9.9 million people waiting for surgery.<br /><br /><br />That&#39;s all the BS I could take from Bernie. Socialism is always a dead end beating a dead horse.just get them in here 3 at timeRemember BURGER&#39;S🇺🇸   healthcare is COMMUNISM  !Oh shit here we go againOfficially the best podcaster everI have a new found respect for Bernie now.Wow this is fantastic!

I was just saying recently you should have Bernie Sanders on!!!LolBernie2020 !I saw him on Marshall&#39;s Instagram 👋Bernie Sanders - the economically and historically illiterate socialist who thinks, like every socialist before him, it will be different this time! Joe references Chicago and Detroit, then asks a far left Democrat how to fix these places. Detroit hasn’t elected a republican mayor since 1957.

Feel the burn baby!No, nope, nut!I never clicked on a Joe Rogan Podcast so fast in my life!!!Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos next please!Nigga get trump in theirThe VA wait-list &quot;scandal&quot; was actually fraud.  That is a crime.  At least SIXTY people died as a direct result of that crime, that is murder.  Bernie went out of his way to prevent investigations and he protected the orchestrators and the million dollar bonuses that they killed veterans for.  He&#39;s an accessory after the fact as far as I&#39;m concerned and deserves the harshest punishment under the law.  Fuck Bernie Sanders and whoever think he&#39;s a good person.Bernie died on this podcast..RIPIt’s going down!!!Joe 100% works for the CIABernie &quot;Minimum wage should be 15 dollars at least for all but my staff will do fine at 12&quot; Sanders<br /><br />Bernie &quot;Baltimore is like a third world country&quot; Sanders <br /><br />Bernie &quot;Hillary stole my nomination but I got an Audi and a beach house from my fans so thats alright&quot; SandersWell I did not fucking see that comingFeel the BernDefinitely getting super stoned later &amp; watching this!Bolshevik BernieNo way he got this old crusty liberal on here this should be goodBernie2020An hour of promising free shit?Bernie 2020!!I can’t see this video generating any controversy or unrest in the commentsShould&#39;ve asked about his staff wanting 15hr lolHoly shitI&#39;ll bite. At least he had the balls to go on Rogan. Now the real question is will Joe push him or give him the most soft ball interview ever.I do not have high hopes. Let&#39;s see what we can learn here that can&#39;t be read in his bio. ZzzzzzzJoe, now that you’ve done this.... give us what we want.... TRUMPTRUMP 2020!Where is Andrew Yang?Holy shit I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s really onThis is what we’ve been waiting forIt’s. About. To go down(((Bernie Sanders)))Like I&#39;ve been saying,  Joe you don&#39;t have the stones to interview president Trump.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FACT">#FACT</a>What happened to live JRE?So much ignorance regarding Bernie, hope some people will actually listen to him.It&#39;s about f&amp;$%ing time you had him on. Good interview as usual.The folks not on the hard left will still listen to this and appreciate that Joe got Bernie on the show. The folks on the Left are still bitching Joe gave Ben Shapiro &amp; Alex Jones airtime.This was an automatic watch, but I would&#39;ve loved Tim pool to feature in this podcast just so joe doesnt have to risk his liberal following and someone can ask real impactful questions.NEVER EVER CLICKED FASTERYAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!-I&#39;ll say this off rip and then I&#39;m out Berrine your a dirty commie.

It&#39;s Mr. Sanders!_uck this socialist.I want Bernie to smoke so badFuck Bernie SandersWas it just me or was this not live streamed<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump2020">#Trump2020</a>🤮 He&#39;s a real shyster with some seriously evil politics but congratulations on the interview.✔<br />It&#39;s understandable that you can&#39;t push too hard on his insane policies because if he ruins his reputation doing this podcast, other big names will be hesitant to appear on the show. So there&#39;s an inherent need for a lot of softball questions in order to ensure the future of the podcast and its ability to attract big name guests. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Don&#39;t forget, EVERY politician is completely full of shit. Even Uncle Bernie here. Don&#39;t fall for their nonsense.&quot;So Bernie you&#39;ve had a very long and successful career , but have you ever tried DMT ?&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for this for four years!!!!
