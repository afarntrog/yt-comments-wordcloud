Hi Gaurav  , can we have server id as one of the columns in the table and use that also while querying the DB , so that it picks only the undone orders by that server(dead server) only, and rest can be taken care by the load balancers which is distributing the load ?amazing series!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=2m21s">2:21</a> ahahahahahaha.Please make a video on Udemy System Designthis is awesome explanationPlease create a video over HermesJMS. This video was really helpful in getting the basics of MQYou are the best teacher. Thank you very much.Very confusingAmazing video.A very good videoHi Gaurav , Nice video with simple example. please make a video on ListenerAmazing work Gaurav, Keep inspiring!Last time, I was attending one interview and detailing similar restaurant example.<br />They have asked me, &quot;what is this design pattern?&quot;. But I said something that was incorrect.<br />I would like to drill down and identify all the possible design patterns with right examples (just in restaurant is sufficient).<br />Could any one help me on this?I love the turn in at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=4m09s">4:09</a>Do you have video for Disruptor? I am looking for your nice presentation.In my view, load balancing is not required here. It may be overkill. It is slipping from main concept of Message Queuebro, you doing wellHey Guarav, I am curious. If S3 (server 3) went down, can&#39;t traffic 9 and traffic 11 be identified as the ones that need rerouting if the database table had a column specifying which server it was routed to? That way we can query in the DB for requests that were lost by losing S3 instead of querying for all requests that have not finished yet.Pretty well explained.Hello, really grateful for ur video, really. But May I give u little suggestion ? I’m backend dev, and new to system design. Sometimes I can’t understand what u r trying to explain. U speak then u stop then speak then stop. I think maybe things would get better when u try to explain things more fluently ? Again, really grateful for ur videos. Just really want to understand every video u shares with us😬 thx!Hi Gaurav, In the video where we discussed about duplicating order no. &#39;3&#39; between S3 and S2, the S2 is still up and running right? So will there be a case where load from S2 should be distributed to other servers? Will we be doing load balancing even if the Server is active?These are some really good reads about how message queues can be used for both server failure and load balancing<br /><br /><a href="https://dev.to/matteojoliveau/microservices-communications-why-you-should-switch-to-message-queues--48ia">https://dev.to/matteojoliveau/microservices-communications-why-you-should-switch-to-message-queues--48ia</a><br /><a href="https://insidethecpu.com/2014/11/11/rabbitmq-qos-vs-competing-consumers/">https://insidethecpu.com/2014/11/11/rabbitmq-qos-vs-competing-consumers/</a><br /><br /><br />Since message queues work on publisher-subscriber model, we should also consider the case of load balancing at the publisher end like topic based/ content based load balancing.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern</a>I like the way you explain itI ordered pizza after watching this video😋That &#39;filling up the coke can&#39; face! LOL :D - thumbs up for a great video explanation!Thank You Gaurav for the video...I was wondering in a typical system design where does the messaging queue reside? Going by the concept, messaging queue is checking health of different servers, load balancing and heart beating..So, I am guessing it resides on an application server?? And then it talks to different server where the service has been hosted?Hey thank u so much I appreciate your work I have a query can u please help me out, I think u do have adequate amount of knowledge 😊I was disappointed to not see anyone appreciating the 9/11 crashing pun at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=4m36s">4:36</a> lolll@Gaurav:<br />Though content is good. I feel you are violating seperation of concern design principle by let load balancer deduping request from client. What we can have is FrontEnd service which takes care of these tasks and load balancer would hit one of the FrontEnd service.<br /><br /><br />Also zookeeper is the best choice for heartbeating and sharing some distributed info about a cluster of servers. I would recommend to use this.<br /><br /><br />What you say?<br /><br /><br />P.S. How could you forget kafka as message queue example :Pthis is the first time I found the wrong explanation.<br />1. Once you have notified and it found that server 3 is dead then it can give that specific task to &quot;assigner&quot; node which basically divides the task and share between other nearest server to that location (it is important). <br />2. Each shop has to maintain his own task queue and &quot;assigner node&quot; would add those task in that queue based on priority ( but this will be least among its own task, as it requires to completes own task first then other. ) <br />3. there is no use of centralized queue, until n unless you provide a feature to the pizza shop and based on user location pizza shop automatically (user did not select the shop which is always the case in dominoes at least)  assign this task to the nearest shop. <br />4. Load balancer (if you were talking about the actual load balancer between servers) is no use for the assignment, as its responsibility to just equally divides the task across multiple servers within the same region for which this load balancer responsible for.How S2 wont loose it buckets ????? Please can you elaborate Gaurav Sir  .....   In Consistent Hashing , some buckets from s2 is supposed to shift from s2 to s1 and same like s3 to s2 ..............   Sir please clarify my doubt I am in confusion !!!!!Hi Gaurav,<br />I have two questions regarding this:- <br />1)  How would the shop ask the client to pay, would you like to keep a WebSocket which is already evented or would you have some sort of polling, which again would take up the client resources?<br />2) What will happen in a scenario where a machine crashes, you redistribute its load and the machine comes back up again. Then there would be duplication for that request. How to handle that?Great video! One minor tweak I&#39;d make, rather than pushing tasks to the server why not have the servers pull tasks from the queue. No need for a load balancer and you can spin up new server instances without any bookkeeping or overhead.Is this similar to how RabbitMQ works?Why the heartbeat mechanism causes shuffling of all the incompleted orders?  It need to take account only that of the dead server&#39;s right?<br /><br />See only few gals are commenting out :DCool!<br />Thanks for sharing.Please confirm if my video understanding related to queues are correct :                                                                                                                        <br /><br /><br /> When S3 crashed, we wanted to re-distribute the order no 9 and 11 to other pizza stores (s0 to s2).But server did not have record or order no&#39;s which were assigned to Pizza store S3.<br /><br /><br />Initially we thought of using &#39;Load Balancer&#39; for this purpose. (This is clear to me, so moving to queue now)<br /><br />After that we improved our solution by using &#39;Message queues&#39;. If we use &#39;Message queues&#39; then we need to have one &#39;Queue&#39; for each Pizza Store (Both at client and server side applications). Each pizza store will listen to its own &#39;Message queue&#39;. Whenever a new Pizza is added to a &#39;Queue&#39; (belonging to S3). when this Message is received by Pizza store S3 and acknowledged and then S3 starts processing it. If S3 is &#39;SUCCESSFULLY&#39; able to complete it then message will be removed from the Queue at server side. <br /><br />If S3 crashes then heart beats are not received and all messages stored in the Queue [belonging to Store S3] will be added to other store&#39;s Queues.<br /><br />If S3 throws error/Exception (Enough Cheese not available for Pizza) during processing then message is still on server queue [Not a valid use case for current discussion]Most probable combinations of scenarios: <br />Async, Sync and in-flight from an architectural or design principles for any business applications or business applications with active messaging queues.<br /><br />Might be great to exchange and share more tgoughts to and on this sometime.what are different mechanisms to  assign Message Queue to different servers. is there any tutorial on this ?from where did you learn all this stuff? really great video :)As a European developer that has seen too much low-quality programming disasters from projects outsourced to low-wage Asian country developers, I must say that it&#39;s refreshing to see an Indian engineer that has actually studied for this stuff and knows what he&#39;s talking about, using the correct terminology...

Which part of the design could help us in achieving this?There is an wide popularity of Kafka as Messaging queue&#39;s , as i understand Kafka is not maintained (except confluent) ,so you need to take care of scaling /replication /availability/SLA-guarantees/Latency(cross geography presence) all sorts of things to manage on your own it on the other hand there is Google pub/sub which is an maintained solution and keep you away from all this maintenance and provides all features of an queue ... which one is better ?  <br /><br />Although couple of limitation of pub/sub is by default it does not maintain  order which if you actualy do want it it is possible using PUB-SUB/IO  , but also in general maintaining order for an high scale system an anti-pattern and would&#39;nt slow you down ?9 , 11 are being handled by S3 and it crashes 🙄🤣Super!!! Thank you Bro...Hi Gaurav,  I agree that it won&#39;t duplicate to same server(i.e &quot;request3&quot; won&#39;t go to &quot;s2&quot; again) but &quot;request 3&quot; can be gone to server &quot;s1&quot; right? How does &quot;s1&quot; know not to serve &quot;request3&quot; which is currently in process with &quot;s2&quot;.<br /><br />Will load balancer lookup for all the virtual hash functions off all servers whether this request is already there?Hey Gaurav, appreciate your awesome work. my point is as you gave example if a pizza shop is down. what i think there will be no server on shop side and a shop has a client id only<br /><br />servers must be at remote location.<br /><br />orders object must have a client id.<br /><br />there must be process on server side that check heartbeat of client with an associated client id. if that client id down ( clients spawn a heartbeat thread to server and server checks heartbeat from client) then it will do the rest of things your explained done by your notifier   component to assign the orders ( to client having nearest to client which is down)Gaurav, this is really a nice and knowledgeable tutorial you have made, in very sort time you have explained this topic very clearly. Can you try to make it as a practical ( how to implement RabbitMQ)at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=5m28s">5:28</a> he makes himself laugh and forces not to laughThank youWhen  s3 crashed, requests which were assigned to s3 (9 and 11) are redistributed to other servers( s0,s1,s2), but why there is need to redistribute the requests which were already served by (s0,s1,s2) in the first place -&gt; didn&#39;t get this point.<br />Going forward, let say they are also needed to  be redistributed, but doing that won&#39;t again send requests to the same server again.<br /><br />consistent hashing just assigns a particular range of &quot;hash key&quot; of requests to a server, and when one of the server dies , it just redistribute requests of dead server among other servers, it doesn&#39;t check whether the &quot;hash key&quot; of incoming requests is already being served by a server or not, it justs forward the request. Then how UNIQUENESS is achieved?Nice work. So on and so forth. 😂Please make one video on Kafka. Appreciate your work. &lt;3When is it overkill to use a MQ?Is Kafka a messaging queue similar to RabbitMQ? Or is it a completely different animal?what is the different between message queue and message broker?why order3 can&#39;t come to server s1 (@7.31)In a typical System design interview: Dabbe banao dabbe.. :Dwhen u say bucket, do you mean some sort of a set???Well..Well...9 and 11 are taken by S3 and S3 crashes.<br />He said it unconsciously, it proves that mind can relate things flawlessly without someone&#39;s knowledge.why use a notifier in period 15 second  instead of you can use a periodic checker on main queue that status is not done. I have a best idea in Software Architecture works  based on Store Procedure, I&#39;ll be happy Cooperation with you to expand my idea. my email: iranerpgroup@<a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail.com</a>Isn&#39;t Kafka a message queue?Why ar Venom xd9/11..and it crashesGaurav i am going to implement bulk email sending service. My use case is when a person purchase tickets for multiple persons then my service should send tickets to their corresponding email using any email service. I think messaging queues would be best in this use case.s2 is processing order no:3, how come it&#39;s possible to process order no:3 from s3,(how come it&#39;s possible  to pick single request by multiple servers)The only youtuber that keeps his video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk&amp;t=9m59s">9:59</a>I just wanted to know about the notification server. You said the notification server will query the server for order completion but won&#39;t the load be much lesser if the request from the server&#39;s end is sent instead of the notification server querrying repeatedly to each server. I may be mistaken or it may be some implementations specific stuff. 😀 Just want to understand.... Can it be also done like this.Hi, very nice video! I have a question, what about the Event Queue? Is it the same, something similar or something else?Gaurav,  the message queues would work for some offline processing.. Can u please throw some light on using the same for ecomm apps where customer interaction and response should be that of real timePlease suggest any good book for system design.Hi gaurav. please make videos on design and analysis of algorithms..<br />Things like how to determine the complexities of algorithms.. thanks for all your efforts.Hi Gaurav, All your videos was great and helpful for all of us who trying to get in to IT jobs. can you explain the messaging queue architecture design and post some videos in Technical architect interview preparation processGreat videoHey Gaurav, you explained the concepts behind services provided by a message/task queue neatly. Your system design series is extremely useful for beginners like me. Keep up the good work.<br />I have a small suggestion regarding the pizza example. In the scenario of a pizza shop node failure, the load balancer may consider other factors such as geographic proximity of a particular shop to the clients location. Hence the  dynamic reallocation of requests by load balancer also includes some business logic. This makes the example a little bit complex for explaining the purpose of message queue. Please do consider finding out more simple examples which serves the purpose without additional complexity in future videosGreat video. Would like a part 2So from what I know, a message queue is different from a load balancer.. How can a message queue has load balancing, heart beat, and notifier in it? that confuses meThanks a lot Gaurav for this video.😊👌👏👏 Suppose a server is doing some heavy  image processing task and it consuming lots of time and task queue declare it as dead server then how can we recover that processesing? Even if task queue directs that request to other server then same case is definitely going to be happened with that server as well. How to handle this problem?<br /><br />Regards.When notifier check that server 3 is down, and it ask for list of jobs not completed. right then why it cannot ask for jobs specifically related to that&#39;s sever from dB and fetch jobs related  to say server3 and allocate them to other servers. Will it will automatically resolve the duplication problem?Great job explaining everything in a way anyone can understand. You are a natural teacher! Please continue teaching and sharing your knowledge!Thanks, But duplocate handling has been taken care by all applications and it is mandatory almost decade back, that is the obvious in Computing technology. Anywat session was good.Hi Gaurav,  I have a little doubt in uniqueness with load balancing while say S3 server goes down and it has a order id 3. And also lets assume s2 has also an order of id 3. Now let&#39;s assume the request_id for both the order fall within the region which is to be routed to Server S2 when S3 is down. How will it handled then ? as we don&#39;t have the info in DB order_id 3 is associated with which server ? Please help . Thanksu r talking about distributed processingYou mentioned that server 3 is down, then why can&#39;t we just send the unfinished deliveries of server 3 to other servers, so there will be no duplication in the first place.Awesome video!!Concept wise, what would be a different between a Worker, a Consumer and a Producer? I am having some difficulties distinguishing between these conceptsHi Gaurav, nice video. Can we have the gateway consisting load balancers to distribute the requests to different servers and msg queue only to communicate between servers?Very niceHi Gaurav, Can you please explain this in more details like what are the classes hierarchy used to make such application ? Your teaching way is too good please explain this also. (Y)What if two messages in the message queue are dependent. <br />Say for eg I have a order management system.User pays for a product online and buys it .Now there will be two types of messages to be sent. <br /><br />Say one message is sent to user for payment information, <br />another message for  the seller saying order is placed. <br /><br />Now the payment msg should be sent to user first (on successfull payment) and then notification message to the seller. <br />Order should be preserved. What if the first message sent to user is failed, <br />we should avoid notification msg being sent to the seller.<br /><br />May be the example I have provided doesn&#39;t depict exact real time scenario, somewhat similar situation. <br />How to handle these kind of scenarios in message queues where sending one message depends on another message deliveryHi Gaurav, can you please tell me how this problem of asynchronous request processing was handled before message queues are invented?Bro, keep bringing up more videos like this. We are all such a big fan of yours. ALL the best! 👍 <br />PS: Amazon has SQS ;)Appreciate your work!! thanks for sharing.Hi Gaurav, This is the one of the best real life example (with pizza shop) showing the need of asynchronous request/response system. Thanks for the great video. Really loved it.Message queue is getting lots of spot light in the industry, please keep making the video on this topic i like you way of teaching. thanks again.Very well explained👍 ..If possible please make a video or two on Kafka Queues( involving Producer n Consumer ) ..This would serve as an example for for few of your previous videos on MQ,Load Balancing,Event Driven Systems..This would help them put together..HEY GAURAV<br /><br />Is messaging queues and task queues are the same things ?You use &quot;so on and so forth&quot; a lotSystem Design: What are Messaging Queues?<br />9,999 viewswhich mq is better?I am third year btech software engineering student and I am comfortable with normal coding....what should I do for better placementsWe would like to have videos on object-oriented design patterns too like observer pattern etc.<br />Please keep making videos. :DHey Gaurav, how expensive it is to distribute all the Orders of one shop to other shops? And Please clarify about the backlog issues in this mechanism. Thanks for the video!What if there is a change in order request by the customer. Does these messaging queues allow accessing any random data variable? if not than I think that we need to maintain another in memory hash map for the above request as it would be not adequate to query database as the wait time would be more.I&#39;m self taught and system design is not an area that I seem to be learning from documentation (and that makes sense, it isn&#39;t relevant to synatx or features of most technologies). Thank you for providing this material! You&#39;re decent to good at teaching, but mostly you&#39;re providing resources that are difficult to acquire outside a classroom or without a mentor.There are very less resource available for system design in youtube so please complete series . I like the way you teach. Thanks for making videos for us. God bless youNice explanation! Can you suggest resources to follow for system design?Hi Gaurav, great fan of your hard work. Can please suggest some resources for learning system design in depth.Consider 4 servers. server 3 which was processing request R3 and R33 gone down. (Service is about to complete) these requests now are assigned to other servers and they start processing it.   meanwhile server 3 comes online. Now at this moment other servers who got extra request s just started, and there work for those services is very less compared to the work done by S3. In this situation service assigned is reconfigure again??? Or work done by S3 is simply discarded???for each system design if a detailed explaination is there, then, it will be helpful for all becoz i think i can learn system designs from you <br />thank you for your extraordinary work
