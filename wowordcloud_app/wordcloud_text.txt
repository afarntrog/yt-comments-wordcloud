SE cupp cakefor all you dems complaining that cnn is being rational, just turn on Rachel Maddow if you want to be told what you want to hearExactly what CRAZY ideas is Trump running on?Patronising Los.It will be interesting to see which candidate is wanted by CNN, Google, FB, MSNBC and China want for the next left wing candidatec cupequal medicare for all? Ok, propose how this is done, without killing small business.. We&#39;re waiting!She was so fired up and angry at the beginning and just sort of deflated in what I hope was dawning realization that this issues are multifaceted and therefore requires multifaceted solutions that &quot;sound&quot; out of the box but actually is already being done (in a manner which is costing us more).its difficult to watch her talk with all that hand movement going onJust corporate dems pushing their near propaganda agenda it‚Äôs all about the Benjamins , free college? Free healthcare? A living wage for the majority defining a well functioning economy? Heresy!! We couldn‚Äôt make as much money off the poor if were helping the poor T_TDude, this is the dumbest shit i‚Äôve ever heard, ‚Äúthe spiks can go to the er if they want healthcare then get deported afterwords, what more do they want?!‚Äù <br />Polls: 70 percent want medicare for all<br />Cnn: MOST AMERICANS DO NOT WANT MEDICARE FOR ALL <br />The only polls where americans are against single-payer are push polls,, ie; ‚Äúwould you support a government run system if taxes went up, time to get care increased and medicare went away...‚Äù 3 makes no sense, 2 in untrue, and 1 is obvious, but most people would be better off net after tax without paying for insurance. Stfu about ‚Äúleft wing media bias, just because they have a black ancor here or there doesn‚Äôt mean they left wing, insisting that though, does mean that the right wingers saying that are racist afSE Cupp is an idiot! Sorry! Glasses don&#39;t make someone smart!So proud of President Donald Trump with North Korea! Say what you want...but you would have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to see that this man is doing a great job! I&#39;m an American before I&#39;m a Democrat or Republican...and I&#39;m willing to give credit where credit is due! I want what is best for our country before I want what&#39;s best for a party! My vote is for America...and that just might mean that Donald Trump has my vote for 2020! Imagine how much more could be accomplished, if we all worked together! We don&#39;t need to worry about outside wars...we have one going on right here inside our own country...and it&#39;s not benefiting any of us!Meh‚Äù cnn is sooo far left wing‚ÄùThis woman needs a brain enema...  She is clearly bias and should not be granted an audience, on this network. &lt;changes the channel&gt;I think the Democratics are¬†implementing EXACTLY the correct strategy ‚Ä¶ in order for Trump to be reelected. With this one difference. This time, if the Democratics continue this strategy of bending over backwards for illegal aliens (free full medical coverage) and students (total forgiveness of school loan debt) and slackers (monthly stipends to NOT work), they will not JUST reelect Trump, they will lose the House AND increase the Republican majority in the Senate AND reelect Trump in a LANDSLIDE. So I say, again, the Democratics are engaged in EXACTLY the correct strategy. But hell, even though it spells political disaster for them, it satisfies their self-centered infantile base...and that&#39;s all that matters. Right?!This woman is horrible!I normally like SE Cupp, but this was massive cringe festfor a Republican, SE Cupp occasionally makes some good points.... but she is lost to reality here.<br />She FOOLISHLY expects all of these Dem candidates to appeal to her (a Republican).  FAR MAJORITY of Americans support universal health care, support expanded public transportation, support forgiving the horrid student loans, and so much more, that Cupp cluelessly says &quot;few people support&quot;.  She means FEW REPUDS support it.He wants Biden? What is wrong with these people? Trump will eat Biden alive.THERE‚ÄôS STILL TIME VOTE TRUMP 2020 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏Trump uses a lot of words to say nothing....Both CNN and Fox news are partisan with different hosts with different opinions. They all cherrypick facts. Check out C-span, pbs, and npr. Or if yall like articles check out BBC America.&quot;glad handing dictators..&quot; how about an olive branch of peace for once!Republicans are running for the right.She is one of the dumbest pundits on CNN by farWhew! Thank God Van Jones came out. She was starting to make sense.Democratics.  Same dull, safe, swamp.  Different from the Republicans?  Not so much.All you people in the comments are so butt hurt because cupp is not going with the far left nut house agenda the Democrat party has become.This was the dumbest segment I&#39;ve ever seen. Well, not counting the entire existence of Faux News.Why would people want to continue to be at the whim of insurance companies where when you get a terminal illness like cancer they can cut you off and leave you to die?Why don&#39;t Republicans do all they can to speak to Democrats?CNN is the most backbone-free news network. At least Fox is conservative, says it, and stays that way. CNN is just a corporate hack.For everyone reading this, I suggest you back out now and go watch Fox News where the news is not fake.CNN&#39;s ratings must be in the fuckin toilet.That one clip, with every candidate on the stage raising their hand for free, taxpayer-paid health insurance for illegal immigrants, will cost the Democrats the election in 2020.This woman is a moron. Come on CNN. They talked about more than what she said. What debate did she watch? Balance is not actually balanced if you use lies to try to balance truth.I can smell the corporate shill from my house you sure you&#39;re not a RepublicanFirst medicare is NOT a government run health care system. It is a payment system and it is actually &quot;run&quot; by private health insurance companies that process the claims. Secondly, illegals do not get free health care. They pay taxes like everyone else.So what she&#39;s saying is this: democrats aren&#39;t reaching out to trump voters. Problem is, if you try to reach out to trump voters for the general election, you lose out on the democratic election. you can&#39;t win the democratic nomination if your policies aren&#39;t left wing. it&#39;s that simpleBernie doesn,t like those attacks except to defend his policies.Hey, Dems, stop listening to Republicans on how to win elections. Look at the polling on the issues and run on those. It&#39;s that damn simple.You aren‚Äôt going to run to the center to win a Democratic primary.damn this woman is a two face <a href="http://fake.is/">fake.is</a> her a democrat are Republican?Jeesh she is so out of touch. A majority of voters want M4A and she is asking these people to do exactly what Hillary did!!!!!!! She went after centrists and republicans to gain their votes, and she f-ing lost!!!!! Stop trying to convince people that they LOVE private health insurance you corporate shill!!!I&#39;ve been a health care practitioner (dietitian nutritionist) since 1991. I learned a LONG time ago: I don&#39;t want sick people around me. <br /><br />What&#39;s the solution to this?<br />--&gt; very affordable sick-care treatment.<br /><br />The problem with our current system when not insuring people: if they&#39;re sick, they&#39;ll only go to the ER when they&#39;re up against a wall, so very sick. So in the meantime, if they&#39;re contagious, that means you and I are exposed to whatever they have, until they finally go to the ER. And they can&#39;t go to the ER (for free) if they&#39;re not extremely ill.<br /><br />I could explain more, but that&#39;s the first point of why we want to offer treatment to everyone.<br /><br />Okay, other benefits to keeping our population from getting sick:<br />healthy people can work more and:<br />1) pay more taxes --&gt; economy!<br />2) buy more stuff --&gt; economy!<br />3) have less need for government assistance --&gt; economy!<br />4) are probably happier and hopefully not doing anything illegal.<br />5) hopefully taking better care of themselves <br /><br />Example:<br />If someone with diabetes loses a foot or leg because of poor blood sugar control (no meds, no insulin needles, no way to measure their blood sugsrs), there&#39;s a high chance this may impact their income potential in the future, depending on their occupation  (definitely if they&#39;re a laborer).Holy shit @cnn! Send her packing to America One News. She should at least know the polling on the policy  matter she pretends to know about.  Trump won on a racist agenda and building a ridiculous wall. How is free Health crazy compared to that? Come in @cnn. Stand with the people.  At least Fox News has some balls.This is how a Centrist attacks the Left and that is just plain stupid when the party momentum is going left with its main gains in support. Same mistake as 2016. They have learned nothing !IMO, Trump&#39;s afraid of going against <a href="http://kamalaharris.org/">KamalaHarris.org</a> and wants Biden to win the nomination.  Trump will beat Biden because Biden doesn&#39;t have it in him to win.Biden is far in the lead those goofy goobers on the far left will be back where they came from by the general election.Oh these two squids are way off base ======TRUMP 2020 for sure and his BASE is GROWING   Thank YOU BLEXIT  -- Lets get Van and Candace Owens to debate she will destroy the whitey in black.You don&#39;t get it. LISTEN UP. The corporations that pay zero in taxes will be taxed and that can pay for social programs. There is no danger in taxing the 1% you sick fucks. When we had free education in the 70s we had a major tech boom right after. Republicans should love social programs because they will give the economy a real boom and balance the budget. I can defend every criticism you are trying to make. This is the stupidest piece of trash video I have ever seen. You two should be ashamed truly.Democrats are hilarious. Journalism is supposed to be objective. Her giving her opinion and criticizing the far left policies being pushed in this primary is a good thing.Wow this has to be the most &quot;wrong&quot; opinioned lady.she was always someone of average intelligence so I would&#39;nt worry too much about her opinionThe questions should be answered as &quot;well I think we can do better and the current systems are not as good as Americans deserve, so I would improve them by......&quot; The assumption inherent in SE&#39;s critique is that everything is perfect now and Americans are too dumb to think improvement is possible.they keep her on to represent cnns version of the other sides opinion.maybe its cause of the way she LOOKS?Why did the candidates running in the Democratic primary say things that would get democrats to vote for them instead of saying things that republicans would like to hearOpening the debate up for the ideas that animate the base of the party is not the exclusive provenance of the right.  <br /><br />Beating Trump, as wonderful as that will be, as deeply satisfying as that will be, is not what history offers us right now. Moving the discussion to the left is. <br /><br />This is our Goldwater moment.How can an  Organization like CNN Be so gullible unless they were paid or or paid by foreign government to be anti-Trump and accuse him of lying <a href="https://youtu.be/sr0Tee0YA4s">https://youtu.be/sr0Tee0YA4s</a>CNN has been giving this damn fool a chance for some time now.What the extreme lefts of the democratic party doesn&#39;t understand is that, even though within the Democrat party there maybe a majority of people who believe in these policies: &quot;Healthcare for illegals&quot; or &quot;Open Borders&quot;. Whoever proposes these policies will probably win the democrat nomination, but they will definitely lose to trump in the general election, because they will lose the swing states (MI, WI, PA, and FL) to trump, because face it, not many people in these states agree with the democrats on these ideas. The reason trump won these states is because he promised to improve the lives of the voters that live there, not to worry about providing healthcare to illegals.The only thing close to reality is found within the comments.. Her narrative is painfully wrong and full of spin. People are only heard in the comments...Very sad.Bitch!!!! If voters don&#39;t agree with the left movement then why this video gets more dislikes than likes?This is the second time I&#39;ve heard Trump to compare democratic candidates to Winston Churchill. Why is he doing that? Does he just admire Sir Churchill very much or doesn&#39;t he know, that he wasn&#39;t the president of the United States nor even a US citizen?I‚Äôm an independent voter and SE you are so right. If a far left democratic nominee gets nominated I will not vote. I despise Trump but we need someone in the White House who can work with both sides. A far left progressive will simply be the reverse of Trump just not perhaps as much of an egotistical ass. I have Republican friends who hate Trump and would likely vote for a moderate democrat but will never vote for a far left socialist like Warren or Sanders.Clown News NetworkNo, no one&#39;s pandering to the minority of the party that thinks like you. And yes, it is a minority. As someone working for a &quot;news&quot; station, you should probably brush up on what the popularity of certain proposals are among Democrats before guessing--wrongly--that a majority want centrist samey crap. Also no, why give a shit about &quot;Trump country&quot; voters. If you can look at all the shit Trump has done and listen to your farmer neighbors or factory-worker neighbors tell horror stories of shutdowns and tax hikes and trouble finding or keeping labor and you&#39;re <b>still</b> A-OK with Trump, it&#39;s a waste of fucking time to talk to you. And enough of your neighbors have had enough that it&#39;s not really &quot;trump&quot; country anymore. In reality, it never was, because half the country are prevented or scared away from voting.<br /><br />Those folks though? Disaffected, disenfranchised, disregarded voters? New voters? The people who outnumber actual voters but either don&#39;t, or can&#39;t, vote? These are the people we need to reach. Those are the people who have been watching with growing disgust at what Trump and his toadies have been doing. Because the GOP has known and professed this since fucking Reagan: The more people vote, the less Republicans win. Pretty telling that they&#39;ve known for a very long time the majority isn&#39;t on their side. Trump &quot;won&quot; by less than 80k votes. If there are only that many people who&#39;ve decided they&#39;re tired of being lied to, or are new voters, or are returning voters, or have never voted before but will be damned if they let 2016 repeat, the GOP loses. The relative numbers are miniscule compared to the whole. Fuck Trump&#39;s unshakeable base--let them be upset when they lose. Let them continue to ignore or hate on politicians and policies that <b>actually benefit them,</b> whether they acknowledge it or not.<br /><br /><br />But go ahead, blather on. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re on some sort of respected platform and people would ask you to actually do a bit of research before shooting your show or anything. Because that&#39;s the way of things, right? The Fourth Estate is supposed to be educated <i>by</i> the public, and certainly not the other way around. No, CNN isn&#39;t &quot;fake&quot; news--you&#39;re quickly moving away from being &quot;news&quot; at all, because &quot;news&quot; takes work and integrity. Heaven forbid we ask that you do more than pontificate.Nobody cares what trump thinks, he‚Äôs an idiot.SE Cupp, girl you got it ALL WRONG! Democratic policies aren‚Äôt designed to just get support from the left. Their policies are popular with most Americans EVEN conservative voters. You seem to be framing your view of Democrats by the Republican framing: WIIFM What‚Äôs In it for me? Real Democrats run on economic policies that don‚Äôt discriminate against conservatives. Republicans talk about socially conservative policies because they screw their voters behind their backs on economic policies.&quot;Telling voters that they&#39;re wrong has got to be the dumbest stategy..&quot; so like what she just did? Trying to tell us what to think.. smh way out of lane for a &quot;journalist&quot;.I dont think there was any concern appealing to dems or moderates in 2016 GOP primaries. It&#39;s a primary....SE Cupp what a big fucking joke she is so bias its mind blowing anyway all what come from CNN  is always bulshit cnn should loose there license to attaking trump 24/7 after that CNN will have the audacity that they are fare and always tell the truth fuck se cup fuck cnnMedicare for all will never happenIt is fine to have arguments against single payer, but if you keep implying there is no plan to pay for it and leave out the detail that every other developed nation has some form of universal healthcare <i>and they all cost less</i> you are not having a good faith debate. You are propaganda.<br />(Also I don&#39;t think <i>any</i> of the proposals disallow you to have <i>supplemental</i> insurance if you want it.. that is another Fox-News-style outright fear-mongering propaganda lie. )You fake idiot! Said the true. That&#39;s the reason you loosing VIEWERS . Tired of the bullshit.Those jugs tho . . .your disgusting fuck off   puke is spewing out of your fucking mouthThis comments...wtf is wrong with this country..i mean too simplify...these Democrats are pandoring to illegal immigrants..and you still can go...so..atleast it&#39;s not trumpSounds like audition for Fox News...You just as bad as them, please shut upShes got resting bitch face.Holy shit S.E. tits are growing on the daily basis.I  guess SE Cupp want dems to be republican lite no matter who the dems pick if they were to win, the GOP  will still obstruct because that&#39;s what they do so fuck&#39;em  they use terms like far to the left like its a bad thing, but far to the right is ok and no majority of the people is not for republicans if they were they wouldn&#39;t fight so hard to steal elections and suppress the vote. se cup is full of it don&#39;t believe the hype and please SE your party pick trump so why in the hell someone wants to take advice from you or your critique even though your party won you guys pick the dumbest person in US history as your candidate and to become president making George W Bush look like a genius so please go and have serval seats .Well, you are wrong...from about 15 different directions.  Should we pander to you because of that?Why does this fool have a show? Go back to fox where they think healthcare should only be afforded to those that can afford it....S.E Cupp is quite unique in that unlike a broken clock, she isnt right twice a day. I mean, this entire clip is one false premise, after another, followed by complete bullshit.<br />Ive fired temp workers for less, SE.She‚Äôs not a journalist cause she sound like a politician lmfaoSE Cupp is a right wing loon.  CNN should be embarrassed to have her as an employee.Se cupp has big titsOH DEAR CNN SHOULD GO DOWN,  ENOUGH OF DISTRACTION AND NEWS 6 MONTHS AGO WAS NO BORDER CRISES NOW IS A DIFFERENT STORY BOOO HOOOO CNNIt breaks down to 2 types of people in the world. People who care about all people and People who care about some people.Let&#39;s talk about that clown show the dems put on... That is news, right ü§£CNN is really a cable news piece of shit ; you all are disgraceful to the people of this nation and around the world üåç , no respect for you guysThis is stupid laid on top of stupid from Cupp Of course you want to give undocumented immigrants health care. Not only is it a human right you can&#39;t have an underclass of people running around society spreading communicable diseases because they are not getting health care. Why do you think the US average lifespan is decreasing when the of the developed worlds&#39; is increasing? <br />Nobody wants to be paying insurance premiums when they can pay way less as part of your taxes. Nobody likes their insurance company they just like it better than not having insurance, at least until they get sick and end up bankrupt anyway with copays and coverage shortfalls. <br />Cupp and Lemon at just plain full of shit here and it is the same warmed over corporate turds we have all smelt for year. <br />Private health insurance is a smelly runny turd and no amount of pro grade turd polish applied professional right wing turd polishers like Cupp is going to make it look or smell any better.YOUR BOTH WRONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Sellouts to the corporatistAre you fucking stupid?!?What you saidThere is a reason SE is relegated to weekends. If she wasn‚Äôt hot, would she still even have a show?The job numbers are not reflective of the economic reality, our health care system is atrocious compared to all other modern post industrial countries, the dems are brining up these ideas because they know that average Americans know the truth witch is that our system is widening the inequality gap and the middle class is hurting.Is this fox or cnnThe Access Hollywood tapes, when Trump essentially said he could rape a woman if he‚Äôs a star.  Trump is essentially raping the Constitution and the rule of law because he‚Äôs President.If Cupp ramped up the snark just a little bit more she‚Äôd be on the same level as Kennedy on Fox NewsShe has nice tits, from what I can see in that tight shirt.She&#39;s a right winged conservative. So why would SE Cupp care if democrats are wrong and losing voters? <br />She wouldn&#39;t. She would only care if she thinks the democrats are finally embracing progressive policies for a change.<br />That&#39;s why no democrat will pay her the least bit of attention.Who is this fucktard?Alright CNN, let&#39;s nominate Joe Biden and have a repeat of 2016.Ok! Ok! Ok!  What‚Äôs going on???  This is CNN right?? <br />I wanted a good laugh today so I always visit CNN for it.  But I got some serious reporting on the issues today.    AAAhhh Crap!!Why dont Republicans appeal to progressives then if were supposed to appeal to themAppealing to moderates and being Republican lite lost in 2016 and the opposite won by a landslide in 2008. Being mini Republicans doesnt work. Why dont we see Republicans appeal to moderates, because they appeal to their base and win the Democrats need to do the same instead of hang their base out to dry. CNNs ignorance of the reality of what is going on in America is so annoying.Lmao love seeing the left lose their mind when CNN starts to report real news for once and hurts their feelings lmao üòÇWtf cnn you trying to get donald elected againClassic, CNN reporter lays it all out and the comments lambasted her efforts.  Hey people who hate Trump, breathe..........  Listen for a moment to your side and vote intelligently.  If a candidate impresses u, GO FOR IT.  But please think.  Fees Democrats out there.  But what r your candidates calling for.  Please think.  PleaseIs she a republican? She needs to go to Fox.The majority of the educated population is progressive/liberal. Single payer , free college, gun control etc are what the majority want and it will come eventually. The status quo is dying.The Democrats are just after decent people.America Loves Trump! 2020 and ivanka 2024. Smoke that narrative media and dems!!!!!They all pandered to illegals. It was sad.all socialists... getting trump elected again we appreciate itIs this a fox news host on cnn????Hopefullt california declares independence. Then we PATRIOTS can nuke their diseased-minded, deviant asses....This asshole is extremely out of touch isn‚Äôt she LOL.this is DR. erroll schmuell would like an interview to speak about african american and jamaican how we are the same peopleWhich era do you live 8n my dear? You are anti free speech? And shamelessly mis interpret the opinions expressed by democrats! Why? Economy is not doing great! Most auto especially the big 3 have closed paints, laid off thousands. Which planet do you live in? It is the lifting of regulations that made polluters hire temps more. And pillute more! It is at the risk of disasterous moves against clean Air, water and food contamination. It is a dangerous slippery slope that this fake growth has set trends in. Wake up. Call a spade a spade.Wow.  I thought this was fox news when I heard this.  The rest of us live in the real world whoever you are.  What&#39;s been going on has not been working and your strategy will just hand over the next election to the gop.  Healthcare as a right is not a radical idea.  Our government working for the people is not a radical idea either.  She&#39;s in a bubble.Hahahaha...

She claims to know what a majority of democrats think?<br /><br />Also, isn&#39;t it better to actually lead and take a country into the future, rather than sell your soul and forget your ideals? What&#39;s wrong with politicians who actually want to make things DIFFERENT?What happens to the females on CNN?  Look at them about a year ago and look at them now.  When you surround yourself with evil it will destroy you.My god this is a bunch of bull....Wow she hit it on the headVan is so hot....too bad he&#39;s got a brain fungusI have never liked this SC Cupp chick, she&#39;s just another talking head, with her personal feelings, actually who gives a flying leap?  She always acts if she&#39;s the sharpest crayon in the box, but it&#39;s just another wagging tongue,  trying to look intelligent. I see through her. No one&#39;s impressed. Can Jones, your a turn coat, both of you talking heads, are having conversations based on who YOU, want to win, not who&#39;s the best one for the job. Like everyone else. People talk bull in the cantidate they don&#39;t dig a than hype up on the one THEY, want others to choose. Get over your selves, the both of you.  Neither of you two can influence other people&#39;s choices,. Shut up all your good at is talking , everyone does that.üò¨ü§êKeep your advice van Jones and you guys are acting that it doesn&#39;t work in other countries and nice you didn&#39;t bring up that in passing Medicare for all you wouldn&#39;t pay premiums or dectubles and if you think it would raise your taxes it really wouldn&#39;t because the premiums you pay count as a tax. so let&#39;s catch up to the rest of the developed world.Wtf is &quot;portending&quot;<br />Trump is about as dumb and smart as they come <br /><br />Even thru all the childish meltdowns <br />Trump is untouchable right now<br />The media is getting paid the most money and attention they have have received in history <br />It&#39;s almost like a setup and Trump and all the media is in on thisShe&#39;s absolutely right! Instead of providing healthcare for illegals how about looking out for American citizens?Watching liberals trying to convince voters of their shit house rat crazy ideologies is like watching a 1 legged stripper trying to twerk.SE CUPP nickname should be TRIPLE D!!!  Those teets could fill a 5 gallon bucket.in Britain, we have had free healthcare for everyone for more than 70 years!<br /><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)</a><br /><br />the poorest person in Britain gets better healthcare than the richest american, <br />BECAUSE in the US, the rich americans get guided to all kinds of unnecessary treatments<br />and surgeries just because the medical people make more money.<br /><br />In Britain, when you go to a doctor, money is NEVER mentioned, the doctor doesnt know<br />if you are rich or poor, and doesnt ask, and you just get the healthcare relevant to your problem.<br /><br />The hospitals are all government owned, and are huge places, and the consultants have huge experience<br />because they have to deal with people from every walk of life, whereas in the US it will be focussed on<br />richer people.<br /><br />Anyway, in Britain, the idea of private health insurance is kind of a dumb question,<br />because say you got ill, you&#39;d dial 999 for a state of the art government ambulance in an emergency<br />or you&#39;d go to your GP for a non emergency, ALL the mainstream medical students either become<br />GPs or consultants in NHS hospitals.<br /><br />you only get health insurance in the UK for when you travel outside the EU!<br /><br />Now you could opt for health insurance here, but what is the point?<br /><br />On the NHS you will get state of the art equipment, state of the art medicine, ginormous hospitals with every imaginable specialism.<br /><br />Because we dont use health insurance, I cannot comment on that, but I do get car insurance,<br />and whenever I requote, the lowest quote will be say ¬£500, but the highest will be OVER ¬£2000,<br />FOR THE SAME DEAL, that means the latter deal is ripping me off by ¬£1500.<br /><br />I expect medical insurance is no different, <br /><br />the insurers literally invent their prices, and airlift a gigantic profit.<br /><br />With a government based health system, with GPs, consultants, nurses, hospitals, ambulances, high tech scanning, surgeons, etc<br />you get economies of scale. Health becomes part of the government service: health, education, defence, policing, <br /><br />the idea that health should be via insurance and private people is as ridiculous as defence being via insurance and mercenary companies.<br /><br />in fact the real scam with the US, is the GINORMOUS amounts of money spent on the US military.<br /><br />if I remember rightly, the US military was something like 8x as big as the next biggest military, and Obama was trying to reduce that to 4x as big!<br /><br />The US military may have ginormous warships, stealth aircraft etc, but an american citizen cannot go on a joy ride on one of those planes or ships! So its all meaningless, its money changing hands, huge amounts of hi tech equipment changing hands,<br />but you are an outsider and onlooker. With the NHS, they have state of the art equipment, and if its relevant to you, then you can utilise that equipment.<br /><br />Once I ended up in an NHS hospital for a month, no invoice for that, no request for insurance, no nothing. Just my health problem attended to, including daily ultrasound. <br /><br />If healthcare depends on money, then there is an obvious conflict of interest, and you will be guided to dangerous treatments that are totally foolish eg facelifts. With the NHS you CAN get a facelift, but only if you have say been scarred or have a malformed face. you cannot get a facelift just as an act of vanity. If the NHS deems that you have a valid reason for a facelift, then you will be sent to a fully authorised plastic surgeon, and it wont cost you a penny. <br /><br />That time I was in hospital, I had had an accident, and they wanted to immediately operate on me, but I begged them to not operate, so they said they would keep me in for a month and monitor me each day with ultrasound. I had some internal bruising, and the problem gradually healed over the month, and I was then released. <br /><br />If that was in the US, probably there would be a GINORMOUS invoice, and if on insurance, my premiums would have sky rocketed.<br /><br />the US system is just not satisfactory.<br /><br />Anyway, in the UK you AUTOMATICALLY get the NHS system, you cannot opt out, but you CAN go private IN ADDITION TO THE NHS. But why? Same way you are entitled to free state education up till the age of 18 or 19. But you can go private, and go to a private school, which I did when I was a teenager. Because the private education is better. But with health, the NHS is the best. Virtually all the medical students go into the NHS. <br /><br />You get world class healthcare from the NHS.<br /><br />And we have had this for more than 70 years, the NHS was founded on 5th July 1948!<br /><br />Here is David Cameron former leader of the country and former leader of the conservative party talking about the NHS:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFqVuNHV7wY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFqVuNHV7wY</a>I have know idea why anyone would give a SHIT about what cupps opinion is. She has never been right about anything.  She and magen should not even be in the <a href="http://media.wtf/">media.WTF</a>!]They all raised hands for free healthcare for illegals. Wont even have to vote for trump in 2020.You want Joe Biden?!? Are you fucking stupid?!?Free Healthcare for the world,<br />another nail in the Democrat coffinKelly Ann Conway has been indicted for using her government position to interfere in the political debate on behalf of the GOP,  why is Drumpf allowed to do just the same?Who asked Republicans to reach out to Democrats in 2016?.. Oh thats right, NOBODY. What Republicans tried to reach out to Democrats in 2016?.. Oh thats right, NOBODY.<br /><br />Conservative snowflakes expectation of beig catered to by the OPPOSITION party, even though they consistently do not support that opposition party even when they&#39;re pushing conservative policies (ACA) is the reason the country has shifted so far to the right that globally centrist candidates are considere &quot;far left&quot; in this country.<br /><br />These Democrats are talking to their base and the 38.6% of voters that didn&#39;t even bother to vote because nobody has given them anything real to vote for. We&#39;ve had enough of trying to put on our best republican lite impressions for people that have no intention of working with us under any condition. We&#39;ll be starting the negotiations from our point of view from here on out, instead of starting them by compromising all the way to the conservative point of view &amp; getting pushed further right. So you can take all of your &quot;friendly advice from your opponent&quot; and shove it up your ass.Oh...so SE is Con&#39;s Meghan McCain with this stupid train of thought.Lady turn down the fucking attitude lolShe&#39;s telling us that telling the truth in an election is a bad idea. Maybe it is, but is it then any surprise that voters then complain that politicians lie to them. I think Ms Cupp is a dumb, smug bitch.CNN. The Republicans already hate you. Stop pandering to them with a woman like this.You should wear a white mic. Also who cares what Trump thinks. He&#39;s a moron!She‚Äôs got nice tits üëçCorporatist trying to save Joe&#39;s Biden run.

He publicly shared a joke with Putin about the latter&#39;s meddling in our elections and made a date with his sweetheart Kim. Trump again won the climate-change game USA-vs-The World (1-19). Heaps of photo-ops, though, with Ivanka &#39;s bosom front and center!Democrat&#39;s candidates full of Joke . Mr TRUMP 2020 . Make America Great AgainThe Democrats CAN&#39;T mess up.  The majority of the voters want trump out, and we&#39;ll vote that way.  The media are paying attention to what the candidates have to say, the voters are waiting for one to get selected so we have someone to vote for because we&#39;ll NEVER vote trump back in.You are terrible!Dumb??  CNN is dumb!You clearly didn‚Äôt watch the 2016 republican primaries. There was NO pandering to the left...Which constitutes more of a majority of the country than the right does.Sorry to say, SE Cupp, but Democratic presidential candidates ACTUALLY DO know better about the economy, healthcare, and a lot of other issues than the minority (yes, minority) that was dumb enough to vote for Trump and thus act against their own interests (except maybe the top 5% of the income scale). And those candidates know that the vast majority would be (and most probably is) with them on healthcare if all of them were aware that they are paying outrageous prices for healthcare, twice as much as the second-most expensive healthcare system in the world. And most people know that a low unemployment rate is NOT a sign of general well-being if the majority of households can only get by with 2 or 3 jobs, leading to burnout, ill health, child neglect, thus more crimes, etc etc.They are all idiots for starters.Here is a fact about MY Obamacare. Today I had my second heart attack. While in the ER I had no bed for 24 hours, then I was transferred from room to room after having my FOURTH stent placed. Person comes in from admitting wanting to know if I can pay an 850 copayment on top of paying a 6,500 deductible, on top of 3 days of hospital stay when the hospital released me  without my proper meds. One medication Brulinta costs $388.00 a month for this prescription. How can I afford that? So when people want medicare for all I think it should be allowed for people like me who now are deeply in debt because of an emergency health issue. I hope that it gets passed before I die. I hope CNN sees this and reports on it. Would be nice. Proves your point. Hospital emergency rooms work together with big pharma to stick to people like me who have Obamacare. If you can&#39;t pay they send you home to die.No dumber than giving you a show.Kick some swamp monsters butt<b>Adidas wants to know your location.</b>Do you realize trump, that Biden is still a very huge margin over and above your wishes?

Lol wtfHow are Medicare for all and taxing the rich unpopular ideas? Lol cnn is a fucking joke.Attention:  SE Cupp - You might want to look at the poll numbers before you claim the Democrats have a bad plan.  Poll numbers show 70% of Americans support &quot;Medicare for all&quot;.   Multiple polls have all reached the same conclusion.  70% support it.   It is not a &quot;Fringe Progressive issue&quot;.   I didn&#39;t bother to look at the polls on the other issues SE Cupp is ranting about.   She was massively wrong about this one, I suspect she&#39;s wrong about the others too.   People would not be running expensive campaigns without understanding the polling numbers on the platforms they&#39;re running on.That&#39;s the same thing happening with football and baseball stadiums.

The Radical Left is a three ring circus, so much nope. President Trump is the single greatest US President in my lifetime. He is doing a great job. He is a known quantity. I can&#39;t think of one single practical reason to experiment with Democratic Socialism. I don&#39;t want to find out how a President Joe Biden would thank the Chinese Communists for dealing with his son. I want the single greatest US President in my lifetime back in office for a second term. President Trump is willing to serve a second term, so he is getting my vote in 2020Errmm. heres the memo in case you didnt get it. <br /><br />As a flat business model, the buyer needs to buy in bulk to get the juicy favorable and competible deal in house. (one of the main)Reasons for the high standard of scandinavian medic-aid is, doh obviously; we have good doctors, nurses etc. You can argue theyre not &quot;best&quot;(anymore), but that is matter of resources and not skills. We have the briansurgeons and what else we need, and we do have some &quot;best&quot; within their field. Its a  good system still, not top 5 anymore, but still a decent top 10-12ish(last I looked)<br />Soerrmm..yea.. unless you start planning some aspects of your economy, then theres a big chance that the nones who wants their private insurance will get to keep that without ever understanding what theyr miss out on. And you wont be able to get the &quot;best&quot; doctors for the public healthcare unless the system is feeding highqual homegrown doctors that get the eduction for free, but they also get a contract for 10 years &quot;internship&quot; followed by 10 years of head-doctor at a mjor hospital. Theyre then free to go out in a private jobcycle. Some do that, others stay till they no longer can see if the nurse is a guy or a gal;) - And you wont be ble to get  full bulk deal when the &quot;seller&quot; knows he have some leverage-<br />s, you need planned educations and planned hirings.

Trump 2020 bitches üòÇAs a black man let me say I am confused on what Corey and Kamala are so hurt about. I don‚Äôt get it. No I do get it. Corey and Kamala both have low support from the black community. So they believe by making this a race issue somehow it will make black People question Joe and somehow support them. All Corey and Kamala is doing for me is making it clear why I will never support either of them. Even if they‚Äôre the candidate which is seriously doubt. They keep saying how Joe keeps making comments is hurtful. I know a lot of black people and not one of us is hurt by what Joe said because we understand what he‚Äôs saying. He simply said he had to work with segregationist in the early 70‚Äôs which was right after Civil Rights. They didn‚Äôt call him boy because he was white so they called him son because they identified with him. Joe NEVER said he supported them or gave comfort to them he said he had to work with them to get things done. So Corey and Kamala believe they are the ones to bridge the racial wounds in this country. WRONG. If either of the, think Trump voters will trust a black man or a black woman they are stupid. Obama was a very good President and they didn‚Äôt trust in him. If Corey and Kamala don‚Äôt even have support from black people how in the hell do they believe they‚Äôre the ones to fix the issues in this country? It‚Äôs stupid what Corey and Kamala is doing. Now I understand why white people are afraid to speak race with blacks. This shit is confusing. I have no idea of why Corey is hurting by Joes words. He‚Äôs really hurting from the lack of support from black voters.Since when does a sitting prez chime in on how the opposition does in a debate?<br />What is the bee in cheeto nazi&#39;s bonnet with Biden anyway?

They just put up a false comment by me. I said... Van Jones wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens in a smart way? That is an oxymoron... promise them free healthcare and they will come by the millions. God gave you a brain... Use it in a Godly way.Thats not SE cupp.  She is a robot replacementThe top you are wearing makes your tits look Supersized CuppI agree with this. I am a lifelong liberal, but was born and raised in Ohio and Texas.  There is no way in hell we will get a win over Trump by being radical. No blue-collar worker in NE Ohio is going to want to hear about giving undocumented people free healthcare when his/her family is living hand-to-mouth. No Texan on the fence wants to hear about opening the border. No poor family wants to think their tax dollars are going to reparations. Sorry. If the Democrats think they can sweep the vote with radical ideas and too-liberal politics, get ready for another 4 years of the Trumpanzees. It isn&#39;t going to happen. They need to look at the underprivileged Americans that weren&#39;t given a pony and a BMW, who saw their fathers and mothers struggle as much as anybody else, before they go promising anything to other people. Class is more important than race this time. And my party is fixing to blow it. Just stay left of center, and shut the fuck up. If Trump is elected again, we will have WWIIII stopped watching pile shit :45seconds in. I could t tell who sound worst; Trump or the news anchor.....smhThe anchor is 100% right. Why pander to a far left base that will vote Democrat no matter what? Does it not make sense to target moderates who are disillusioned by Trump and are waiting for a moderate Democrat to get behind. <br /><br />Championing far left liberal ideas and identity politics will isolate the parties pick from a huge swathe of America while firing up a base that is going to vote Democrat no matter who is running or what platform they are running on.The vast majority of CNN Watchers are so uneducated that couldn&#39;t understand economics if their lives depended on it üòÇ you guys can&#39;t stand it when your own network speaks the truth can you? You guys have got to realize that it&#39;s not about you it&#39;s about the global economy, and there is not a single Democrat running this year that is intelligent enough to understand the delicate balance of the global economy. You think it&#39;s about gay rights women&#39;s rights in all of these little things, you don&#39;t see the bigger picture and none of the democratic candidates do either. Trump understands how this all works whether you like his Style or not your tiny little problems mean nothing on a global scale can&#39;t you see that?Mary care for  old is zero Do not trust Democrats socialistThis could be said of any debate, of either side, over the last 30 years.

A solution working to insure guaranteed failure!<br />Let&#39;s not forget it was the media twisted around Trump&#39;s little finger, being willing used to promote a nutcase, helping get him elected, because it promoted their ratings. And it was the media that performed their own version of a Comey on Dems, playing up Democratic squabbles and Republican propaganda memes, mostly ignoring the bigger picture. Media&#39;s playing kingmaker hurt Dem candidate, too. The media played a significant role in creating--and share responsibility for--the current mess. Projecting fault onto Democrats can&#39;t change or diminish that. Democrats ARE holding this administration accountable and having quite a few successes. However, while media has done outstanding work helping to expose administration corruption, it is failing spectacularly to hold Congressional Republicans accountable to even basic standards expected of any public official.

If this is the message Cupp has for her viewers, and the aim is better ratings, I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a terrible idea!Oohh SE, a nice sound bite delivered with aplomb; however, if I could offer a few thoughts. 1) The majority of people (including Trump supporters) in this country are for single payer universal health care. You can quibble over if and how to kick to the curb &quot;illegals&quot; (Do you suggest we push them out the door to die in the street? This should tail into &quot;illegal status&quot; and the consequences of that). 2) If you believe certain voters (from any side) are voting against their own interests due to the enormous amounts of money spent to deceive them, we all (I might add especially journalists) have a responsibility to try to counter that deception. 3) Finally (although I have many more thoughts about your comments), I would rather have a politician who has clear convictions about what is good and right for the country, doing their best to convince others and combat the misinformation (rampant in our system); than someone trying to tailor their message to voters - their only real conviction being a thrist for political power. When you have enormous amounts of money spent to influence voters away from their own interests, and a President who has made a living deceiving people (he&#39;s very good at it), should everyone play along to avoid hurt feelings? Truth tellers normally aren&#39;t usually the most popular... at first. What we should be doing is asking ourselves, who is telling the truth? Who is speaking with conviction and unwavering in his / her values? None of us will ever agree on every single detail - that was the point of a democratic government. We need a leader who&#39;s honest and open, and who has integrity and character, not someone who&#39;s a follower of polls, but a leader.Oh good, I was starting to worry she was sick, she&#39;s back to her rightwing nutball ways...Whats your party bringing to the table?

Most of the beliefs, ideals and talking points she&#39;s touting as &quot;Dems shouldn&#39;t be telling those Americans they&#39;re wrong&quot; are ideals and talking points that originate from Trump or the Orange Administration themselves. If telling, or rather showing those Americans how they&#39;re wrong is a &quot;bad strategy&quot; then tell me ms Cupp, what would be a good strategy? Lying to them just so they can hear what they want to hear?<br /><br />I&#39;d rather tell people what they need to hear, personally. Telling people what they want to hear, reinforcing those wrong notions they have, that&#39;s simply feeding ego, which is an inherently Trump concept. Trump in fact isn&#39;t interested in enacting truly positive changes to health care or education or to the continued well-being of the environment. He has a large number of Americans believing the economy is &quot;great&quot;, when there are several ways that it clearly isn&#39;t. To me the choice between speaking the truth born of fact or leaving people to their delusions is a clear one. The answer to it seems clear to many of the Democratic candidates.<br /><br />Thus the only remaining question becomes... why isn&#39;t that answer clear to you, SE?No wall, increased natoonal debt, decaying asylum policies and a bunch of racism.

Trashy framingAny time a prominent conservative trots out the &quot;Democratic candidates can&#39;t possibly win by...&quot; routine, I think &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re the person we need to take advice from. Would you like us to overturn Roe V Wade now, oh wise one?&quot; 3 out of the 4 op-eds in today&#39;s newspaper (those crinkly things with facts inside) were various takes on how Democrats Can&#39;t Possibly Win By...wow CNN both these people are idiots, The Declaration of Independence says ALL men are created equal, it doesn&#39;t say the rich are more equal than the poor so the rich should be able to BUY more rights than the poor. Healthcare is a basic human right so the rich shouldn&#39;t be allowed to have better healthcare than the poor that are both citizens of this country, I do agree that we shouldn&#39;t, and can&#39;t afford to, give free healthcare to anyone that manages to make it into our country illegally who aren&#39;t citizens but just because an asshole like Trump was born rich they shouldn&#39;t get better healthcare than someone who is born poor, nothing equal about that. Education it another basic human right, and should be basic on grades, not the ability to pay for college, we need the best people in their fields of study regardless of wealth. You need both healthcare and education to have &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;.This from Trump who daid he would debate Bernie Sanders and then dodged it like the loser Trump ismTrump will winn with a landslide and thank God for that.This lady is a muddled self opinionated non journalist. Some folks don&#39;t warrant attention. I for one won&#39;t waste my time on her self opinionated views.Oh this is CNN. Do not expect unbiased reporting.This is dumb why should a democrat debate have to appeal to republicans, do repubs try to have appeal for democrats.?...from one of the dumbest rinos on the planet.Maybe she should look to the Republican primary for Republican ideas ! Oh wait there essentially is no Republican primary lol .Hey SE Cupp! Go work over at FOX, where you obviously belong or take down that fake CNN logo!I think SE Cupp is generally sound, but her question, &quot;...what  about those who don&#39;t want to pay OTHER peoples kids&#39; college tuition?&quot; is just about the dumbest thing I have ever heard - but also very typically American. Not just the developed nations, but also most DEVELOPING nations offer free or very low-cost taxpayer-funded university, because they INVEST IN THEIR LONG-TERM FUTURE and are happy to have as many graduates as possible, regardless of their family circumstances!  Only the US is happy to have a huge army of &quot;poorly educated&quot; workers to be poorly-paid slaves of industry.CNN cadets hate this women lol&quot;he didn&#39;t respond great, this is not Winston Churchill we&#39;re dealing with&quot;... I&#39;m sorry for people who hate his guts but honestly I find his weird quips hilarious.Does se cupp follow polling at all ?!  She is the typical establishment talking head !Uh,give that little speech to the guy that only speeks to his base.Out of touch with reality, S.E.Cup?Wow, Van &#39;&#39;the brain&#39;&#39; Jones. So glad you could share some stupidity with us.Heaven forbid that you stand on what you actually believe is right. As Cupp says, you should just say what is popular.<br /><br />Hey, worked for Trump.Cupp is so damn hot!Lizard in a ski sweater! nice!!SE Cupp doesn‚Äôt do journalism, she just talks about her opinions, they should be more clear that this is strictly Op-Ed.  Facts via polls prove that the majority of Americans agree with and want Universal Healthcare/Medicare for All, lower tuition especially when it‚Äôs income based, and higher taxes on the rich the 0.1% of the 1%.  Read the polls lady, before saying ‚Äúmost Americans don‚Äôt want these things....‚Äù. It‚Äôs an outright provably false statement.This is what news looks like.. just before 3rd world statis,, Amerika is almost 3rd world!!! yea!!More CNN physco babble. What a life to choose, one full of turmoil each and every day. Sad thing to see.Dems want open borders no more ice wage raises on everyone with free healthcare free college no way to pay for any of it.Something&#39;s WAY WRONG here! Someone slapped on a CNN logo and she&#39;s  interviewing Van Jones on her FOX News Show! The <b>Misinformation Campaign</b> Russia pulled in 2016 has begun. Stay sharp people!Bernie Sanders NEVER said that you HAVE to take medicare for all . He said that people don&#39;t NEED private healthcare , because everything IS covered in his plan . In ALL his public speeches Sanders never claimed that he would force people into medicare !!I<br />I bet Van jones for 10000 if he can proof his point !Not your best monologue, your smarter, show it in your dialogue i would like to keep watching your show, if you can step it up, do away with the nonsensical  all of nothing g extreme  line of questions, too simplistic even for my 11y/o sister that found you lacking (lol! Yes! Kids are some and aware) America&#39;s re generation of kids are missed we are messing up their worldwell dumb blond CNN missie , your wrong (again) ! being moderate (biden) doesn&#39;t win elections !! Trump was extreme and not moderate !!! Still he won ! ( with a little help of his friends) . Moderate brings you nowhere !! Sure moderates tend to bring stability , but Putin has one goal : destabilise the western world !!!!!!! With Biden as a candidate , putin will double down !!!!!The comments show how pathetic and drooling CNN democrat-commies hate the truth , EVEN FROM CNN.  YOU WILL LOSE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  America hates you leftist pigswait who is this fuckin idiot?  Is she serious?Democrats are finally listening to their base. At least we&#39;re not carrying tiki torches in Charlottesville... just trying to get a little health care for all. Wtf... the double standards are incredibleI thought she didn&#39;t like Trump. Well it just goes to show that once an Aryan always an Aryan.Healthcare for all is 75% of all Americans comprehensive border policies about 75% Medicare for all the green New deal is about 80 you keep talking about most of Americans most of Americans where are these most of Americans cuz it&#39;s definitely not the 98% of the poor motherfukers working three jobs to try to make ends meetYou know what average I tell a lie 90% less than most people on corporate news mediaAnd republicans believe in giving 2 trillion dollars unfunded tax cuts to the rich and Corporations which is Corporate welfare and that Socialism.  Trump believes in incarcerating children&#39;s on the boarders and taking away healthcare from the middle-class and poor by cutting Medicare and Medicaid to pay for these unfunded tax cuts to the rich.You&#39;re full of s*** get your facts right if you&#39;re going to be a news agency pleaseI love how every YouTube thumbnail of CNN is someone with stank face lolevery time I hear her name i think they r saying &#39;a C cup&#39; like i care what her bra size is lolSE, YOURE CORPORATIST WEENIE IS SHOWING. YOU‚ÄôRE WRONG.Who is this Right wing twat...on CNN.  Her strategy SUCKS...what a joke.  Thank God I don&#39;t watch CNN very often because I don&#39;t know who this stupid twat is.Promises made but never kept that‚Äôs the democratic platform trump 2020 he gots my vote again I‚Äôm a Democrat but this line up is horrible trump bashing will not work they have to win over votersCupp is the dumbest person on cnn.Whoever the next president is, he or she will spend &quot;at least&quot; their first term trying to undo the damage that Trump has done.Why would any democrat take the advice of a republican?<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trump4Prisondent2020">#Trump4Prisondent2020</a>When the fuck did CNN become FOX news? Is this early anti Bernie strategy? Fucking cunts! This is on you.Literally anyone is better than a racist ignorant traitorDemocrats: saying our healthcare system works is wrong - MSM rips them to shred.<br /><br />Trump: The FBI is wrong - MSM ... <br /><br />CNN are hypocrites. Becoming more of a joke then a news outlet. I came looking for facts but keep getting opinions.<b>Avoid the noise, BERNIE üåé 2o2o!</b>THOSE FOLKS ARE CALLED REPUBLICANSYou clearly have not seen a mirror lately.Okay, so what I take from this interview is that we have a job to educate the public as to how bad policy has affected their bottom line.We tried your candidate.<br />Hillary lost!!!!<br />Now let&#39;s try a progressive!I can see how that status quo is working for you hang in there don&#39;t let go never let go Lol Lol üòÇFake news!<br />Bernie 2020!Raise your hand if your gonna be a good puppet üëã...Can&#39;t beleave I&#39;m saying this, but I agree with this reporter, every democratic candidate is dumb. And cares not about this country&#39;s success. I&#39;m with Trump next election.Lady - you are being a total ass!  Every idea on that stage is polled at huge numbers!  You are either totally ignorant of the facts or a total liar!Wow, maybe CNN will learn what is truly going on if they actually look at the likes to dislikes ...probably notVan Jones does not answer straight question from the host, but I am amazed she speaks so fairly here..Jesus christ CNN wonders why people  don&#39;t watch there station anymore. They call themselves liberals I cant tell,with all there Bias against real change. They definitely  showed there hand when they rolled with Hillary.Fox supporters be like. Omg optioned are a disgrace lol when fox is zero journalism and all conspiracy opinionsHey SE cupp youre the DUMBEST PERSON THERE IN CNNWelle I love that shirt. Bye haters.71% of people don&#39;t actually know what they are talking about. Did you ask these questions when it was Republicans debating?  Why is giving everyone healthcare unpopular? Who likes their private insurance?? I&#39;m so sick of this argument. NO ONE LIKES THEIR INSURANCE, THEY LIKE THEIR DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS. You know if employers no longer have to pay for their employees insurance they could pay them more hourly! Why is no one talking about that? I just had great insurance and then lost my job. Now I&#39;m picking a new job by looking at who offers the best insurance..not on what I actually care about doing. If I had insurance through the government then I wouldn&#39;t have to do that, I could actually follow my passion, not be locked into a job I don&#39;t like just bc I need insurance.God bless this show. Fox terrorist supporters will cry foul. Smh. Can‚Äôt fix stupid and nothing is more stupid than a trump supporterTHANK YOU MR.PRESIDEN Donald Trump YOU ARE GREATE!!!!Vance Jones need to stop trying to make things normal. The dems are going to lose the election due to the fact that they are proving trumpf right!!! Is the same talking points but more extreme and the attacks on each other are what&#39;s going to lose the election!!! Dems are their own worst enemies!!!I don&#39;t want this chick to ever Pop Up On My Feed Again how do I block her ass?2019 Democratic debates = embarrassing clown showSe cupp more dd cupToo little way way too late. CNN posturing as lefty critical. Whatsamatter noticed that your ratings are in the tank?? The NATION  hates CNN  with an abiding indelible hatred. YEARS  of lefty manipulation and now you make a belated gesture!!!!! FORGET IT CNN. you are the most despised media institution in world history.  a  banal gesture is not going to change the arithmetic. CNN is finished they just don&#39;t know it.C Cup, this is a primary election not the general. The candidates need to pander to the base to win and then they can worry about trying to swing Trump voters. There is no point pandering to Trumptards at the moment because they won&#39;t be voting in the primary.Trump2020Im here to look at s.e cupp she&#39;s fine asf.How does CNN have this many subscribers, but at the same time most their videos have a extremely bad dislike to like ratio I&#39;m curious ü§î YT boosting them up more than likely at the same time banning demonetizing and sapping subscribers from conservative platforms. They can&#39;t deny it now seeing how project varitas has a high ranking Google official on tape pretty much confirming this.Thank you for speaking the truth. Your a good reporter.What about raise your hand to give free healthcare to the illegals that come to our country. We cant even afford our own healthcare.what an ugly outfit........ugTrumps opinion is worthless just like his word.Who would want to keep their private insurance? I was charged 290 dollars for a cortisone shot. It was considered surgery for the doctor to give me a shot! The shot itself was another 60 bucks. Private insurance (through my employer) is a ripoff, and profit based. The 15 minute visit cost me and the insurance company 960$. Private insurance simply increases the overall cost of healthcare to cover their administrative expense. We, the consumer are paying to get fleeced!‚úãüèΩKeep electing morons from both parties and you keep getting the same result. Vote libertarian or green.Here&#39;s what&#39;s funny she thinks she knows everything f*<b>***</b> run then she ain&#39;t running for s*** all she does and a lot of these m*<b>*********</b> is run their f*<b>***</b> mouth yeah I&#39;m bad guy I talk like this because I&#39;m fed up I&#39;m tired of this b*<b>****</b>it&#39;s hysterical that the American media think that mainstream liberal policies in any other democratic country are &quot; Far left &quot; !! what an absurd country ! obsessed with money and sex and instant celebrity with no ability to think deeply anymoreThank you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23VanJones">#VanJones</a> for correcting this person.Its going to be a landslide folks.  People that don&#39;t even like Trump will vote for him.se cupp is  a rinoLast time I checked a vast MAJORITY of ALL Americans wanted Medicare for all, debt-free college, increased minimum wage, etc. Trump supporters want those things too. They&#39;re just not smart enough to realize that the fool they adore has nothing to offer but hatred, lies, and empty rhetoric.This CNN bitch is so stupid how in the fuck do you have the gall to say all this just because we&#39;re not talking about abortion there&#39;s nothing being talked about lol. You stupid bitch free college free healthcare and free everything else benefits all Americans not just Democrats you fucking cuntWhy is cupp constantly self hugging?You are WRONG.  I only watched about one third of this.Wow, this lady spent too much time focused on her popularity and now thinks commonly held misconceptions are truth based solely on the fact they are commonly held. This does sound like right wing spin.SE Cupp is a two-faced hack who simply switches sides to keep the pot boiling.fake newsSE Cupp, none of what you said is what any of the Democrats support.Moronic commentary from SE. This isn&#39;t a general election debate. It&#39;s a debate for and by Democrats. The grownups in the room know how to distinguish the difference. The 2020 presidential election is 20 months out.Trump is a national hero! üá∫üá∏UGH,UGH,UGH,UGH,TIME TO LEAVE THIS VIDEO,UGLY VAN JONES ON HEREBut the are wrong SC. there is evidence why they are wrong.PANT SUIT KAMALA Harris bringing up the past,let&#39;s dig up her pastThe debates were a no win, you can&#39;t have 10 people explain the intricacies of these issues in 1 minuteFuck Van<br />Let&#39;s ask<br />Ja Rule<br />Where&#39;s Ja<br />I wanta knowI think what you&#39;re asking, SE, is &quot;Are there any democrats running for the grossly self-centered?&quot;  The answer is No.  There is already a party specifically dedicated to them and their self-absorption prevents them from putting principle over their fascist orange leader.  Just because CNN has made room for the tragically self-centered to have a token host doesn&#39;t mean that the Democratic Party has to make the same accommodations.I don&#39;t think anyone inclined to vote for Trump after everything that has happened over the past 2.5 years is someone who would ever have voted Democrat anyway, so I&#39;m not sure why the Democrats would be chasing those votes. Democrats ran a fairly centrist campaign in 2016 with an establishment candidate and lost the Rust Belt states to a madman whose only selling point to those states was &quot;I&#39;m not a Washington Insider&quot;. I&#39;m going to forgive the Dems for wanting to maybe shake things up a little.well, that was a waste of time. Why you going after the Fox model of news CNN? We already have a Fox news network, how about some serious reporting, and smart people on screen?Had to check if I hadn&#39;t accidentally clicked on a Fox News Clip. Enough with that McCarthyist red scare already!Democrats are truly out of touch. The majority of people don‚Äôt like when the government interferes with their lives.Loving those titisThanks President Jimmy Carter for saying the Russians put Trump in the Whitehouse!STFU you moderate cooperate shillGotta say that when I clicked on this video it‚Äôs not what I was expecting. Decent job Cuppwhy is so such a bitch with big boobs dumb as hell she will eat you up and chew you but good in bed real hot her husband told me she loves it all the time free speechI think many Trump supporters are going to vote the same way again.. the DNC is promising The same thing they always do... another batch of corporate stooges that will not change anything for the little guy.. they don&#39;t even mention the homeless people because they probably can&#39;t vote anyway... they keep that issue away from the campaign trail because it&#39;s already being looked after by covert means.. fentanyl.. a depopulation biological weaponGoing through the comment section, I have to remind everybody that SE Cupp is supposed to support the conservative end of the media field for CNN, back when conservatives had somewhat of a leg to stand on.  She&#39;s still espouses what the pre-Trump conservatives where supposed to represent.  She feels she is supposed to represent and give voice to the Bush Era conservatives, back when they were somewhat sane.<br /><br />Yet, even I think she realizes that there are no more Bush Era conservatives out there anymore.  They are all &quot;F√ºhrer&quot; Drumpf&#39;s CON-servatives now.<br /><br />TDLR: No.  CNN is not going down the propagandizing route that Faux &quot;News&quot; has been going down since its inception.  They are still doing old school journalism that gives credence to multiple sides.  Even in this age of Drumpf, we must continue to LISTEN to as many voices as possible.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23KeepCalmAndFightOn">#KeepCalmAndFightOn</a>As I can see, RUSSIA is back !NICE TITZ :)-Why do I care what someone who thinks Paul Ryan would make a good president thinks? SE Cupp should go to Fox!I think it was a dumb strategy for CNN to give you a show.Republican side has the best looking females, this chic is a hack blonde, it&#39;s like placing a blonde wig on a monkey.She sure has soft lips.Im gonna go out on a limb and say that trump voters want healthcare without declaring bankruptcy when they get sick, end to endless wars and affordable college.Trump/Biden 2020 üá∫üá∏ü¶Öüá∫üá∏ü¶ÖFuck you Cupp! What kind of proposals are we hearing from the right? O Yea, important matters like fucking dunking on SJW&#39;s and cutting programs that help the needed to fill the pockets of the ones have it all with the savings. Fucking airheaded tool of the rich.I wonder if it‚Äôs just a coincidence that Beto and co. are pandering to hispanics now that there are more of them than blacks in America? Hmmm....CNN hating againThis woman is not saying ANYTHING of substance. She&#39;s arguing party-politics. We don&#39;t need more of that on either side of the isle.Trump learned a new word: &quot;portend&quot;<br />I am so proud of my president. Who cares if he is a racist. Or a misogynist. Or homophobe. It doesn&#39;t matter that he hammers away at our institutions or divides us with fear so we don&#39;t pay attention to the massive wealth gap. <br />He learns words and meets dictators to kiss there feet. Yay pres. Keep America divided ... again.<br />Dump 2020!!!Look at those tits. Mmm mmm mmm. Now I see why she got the job at CNN. YummyAm I watching Fox news.  This host confuses me sometime with both her image and delivery that feels like Fox newsMeghan McCain is coming for your job.Well a presidential candidate should know better than voters.At least Cupp is a Never-TrumperFake news is pathetic... Trump 2020 landslide victory.Why are they again lying and misrepresenting Bidens own words and positions? C&#39;mon. You gonna do this, get your asses over to Fox News.Please enlighten me. As a recipient of government provided healthcare (and happy for it), I can&#39;t imagine why anyone WOULDN&#39;T want it. Mind you, government provided healthcare is not complete... Most people still have to supplement it with their corporate or additional healthcare (depending on whether your company provides it or not)... But I didnt have to pay a cent when my son broke his arm.<br /><br />Why would someone NOT want a provided (if limited) health care plan?cupp is a joke and misrepresenting what was said.  She is another corporate shill who pushes the fantasy that you would somehow lose something by not having to pay bills inflated by a profiteering insurance industry.  You wouldn&#39;t lose private health insurance you would just be stupid to pay for basic care when it&#39;s now provided to all for free.  She also doesn&#39;t want to mention that you would pay much less of your income for a better health service.<br /><br /><br />cupp also dog-whistled the racists by criticising giving healthcare to illegal immigrants - a really stupid position unless you want to put the lives of legal citizens at risk from outbreaks of untreated virulent disease, but I guess that&#39;s normal in a country where it&#39;s commonplace to let people die because they can&#39;t pay for care.<br /><br /><br />I won&#39;t be clicking on her videos again unless i want to have a good laugh at a transparently racist mouthpiece for corporate interests.Sorry CNN, the majority wants all of those things. 70% of Taxpayers want OUR tax dollars used for US.......healthcare,education,justice rights &amp; reform,economic equality,government out of our bodies. You are trying to cover the facts so progressives look like the minority not the majority. When our tax dollars are used to pay for ourselves then no one is paying for anyone else&#39;s debt or healthcare. Who wants their neighbors sick,stupid and struggling to live?!Trump and Sessions had their supporters pulling little children and babies babies from the arms of their mothers or caregivers, put little children into zoo-like cages, then shipping them in batches to big cities like Chicago or Miami and leaving them there, where they may die of exhaustion, or pneumonia or typhus. This was Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúidea‚ÄùThis bitch is stupid as a turd in the sun!Anyone who thinks Joe Biden is a racist is a complete idiot.  He‚Äôs the ONLY Democrat candidate I would consider voting for.  This country is NOT far left progressive and this country will never be socialist.  I don‚Äôt like Trump but the guy is effective.Awww look at SE, helping trump get re elected. No one saw their presentation the way she did. She is spinning all of their points and throwing them in mud saying they were telling people they were wrong. Not once did anyone say that and not EVERY candidate has those views listed.I never watch this woman, ever.Is this lady for real?Game over, LOL PATHETIC!Bouncy CuppsDonald Trump being nice to Joe Biden because he knows he could not stand up against Kamala Harris. Donald Trump talking about she shouldn&#39;t get credit for things when he literally tweets about how no one thanks him for things. LOL what a jokeIt&#39;s hilarious when Trump attempts to criticize anyone&#39;s debate when all he does is repeat catchphrases and use childish attacks.Yes you are wrong. Miss Cupp. You are just an establishment mouth piece. You must be one of the dumbest commentators on CNN. I am pretty sure that none of the ideas that the Democrats are supporting are unpopular.I like SE Cupp. However she is wrong on worst strategy. We will not get Trump voter. Dems first priority is to sure up base and get people back to poles. Not 45.Is it or is the name of this show sexist I&#39;m just saying . I&#39;m open to opinions.How can a racist like Trump chime in?Actual sense from a CNN commentator? Hell had frozen over!SE is a HORRIBLE LIBTARD.  That statement alone should really anger all 47 of her viewers.  She is a worthless spin doctor.SE Cupp is a republican ... not a dem... she is CNN&#39;s attempt at fair and balanced reporting... which is OK with me ...I would like to see more reporting from different views... same for Fox....  all network media needs to quit licking your party&#39;s ass and lets see some real journalismdamn it, the video says CNN but I am pretty sure this is Fox NewsI&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s hard to focus on the show with those D CUP size BOOBS, wow they are magnificent  ...My Dear you should switch and join the winning side...Trumps side.Yeah Gov&#39;t should govern...  I dislike this person .  she is such a creep....      Why are people scared of smart politicians.....Get the bitch some tissueWhy should Americans pay for health care for illegial aliens? <br /><br />NO THANKS!SE Cupp: One of the dumbest hosts I&#39;ve ever seen.Choosing free healthcare for illegal immigrants over healthcare for the spouses of our veterans is where the democrats lost my vote.Some say she is still asking to speak to  the manager this very day.Those candidates are correct on all those points listed lol‚ÄúThe majority of American people‚Äù. <br /><br />Citations needed.an american president, talking american politics, and giving an example of a great historic public speaker, cites former british pm. churchill.  ohh, this guy...I really like Mayor Pete&#39;s view on things. Medicare for those who want it, a pathway to citizenship, etc. I think the debates will offer some candidates to look back and clean up some issues and views in order to help them appeal more to others outside of the base.se cupp looks a bit dumb to be honestIf everyone had to ride the subway, the transit authority would get more funds, and have better amenities. Likewise for Medicaid for all.The rich are afraid end of storyStop immigration now.....it hurts the working class. That‚Äôs it.So they should lie and say what the ignorant 70% belives.Fuck CNNLol,  more dislikes than likes.....hilarious, the lefties mining salt.None of the candidates should change their views to fit an outdated unevolving  party. Live with your own views and respect that others have their own and that‚Äôs okay, too. The Republican Party is running on fear consciousness which is why they are stuck and we are not prospering in the ways we could be as a country.Van is so FOS! I don&#39;t understand how anyone could want his opinion on anything. Oh yea, this is CNN new home of the young turks.The Leftists have charged over the cliff at full gallop.  Bye-Bye...Who gives a shit what that lying mother fucker has to say about anything!!! Stop with the propaganda crap!!SE &#39;s reductionist take reminds us all of two things:<br />1. The party in power is never interested in nuance. (Repubs)<br />2. SE may work for a liberal network. But she is with the GOP at heart, and will say anything to defend them.Van Jones did a good job moderating this commentator. She made some valid points but you did it in such a nasty way. What we need is a moderate Progressive who can get us out of this mess that we are in... in a gradual and moderate way towards a progressive goal perhaps of someday Medicare for all universal healthcare. Perhaps someday a college education for those who can&#39;t afford it. Just because the Democrats were up there talking about everything being paid for it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to happen tomorrow or ever. The idea is we move towards something that&#39;s more Equitable for working people as opposed to giving everything away to rich people. Is this what this commentator is not saying. That now we are giving everything to the rich people. What about the stock market Fiasco when we bailed out the banks? It&#39;s okay to bail out the banks but not okay to bail out people that are crushed by student loans.Oh, she used to be part of Fox ??<br /><br /><br />I can see the resemblance.Even serial killers serving life sentences have the right to health care. Just because they are human beings, and health care is a human right.  If you are bothered by the idea of illegal immigrants being included in a public health system, it means you have bought the Trumpist ideology that says that they are not human. <br />It is not a crime to live and work in the US (or any country).  The only &quot;crime&quot; of the illegal immigrants is not having the papers that authorize them to do so.  Is that crime worse than burglary, rape, homicide -- so much worse that they are not even human?<br /><br />&quot;Not human&quot; is how the Nazi viewed Jews, Gypsies, etc.  Which is why they put them in concentration camps first,  which then turned into famine and torture camps, then into death camps.  Because, why should the state waste money feeding those non-human parasites?  And the Trump gang has already taken a few steps along that path...Yang and Gabbard have the best chances for Republican voteCupp should just quit faking like she has a non-paid opinionYou SE Cup a lot of people want free health care and want free college , nir to mention not every single person is as selfish as you SE CupMaybe she is a little biased in her opinion<br /><br />February 23, 1979) is an American television host, ... On March 13, 2017, CNN&#39;s sister network HLN announced that Cupp would host a new evening¬†...<br /><br />Political party:¬†Republican<br /><br />Children:¬†1<br /><br />Education:¬†Cornell University¬†(BA);¬†New York University¬†(MA)<br /><br />The economy is doing great for who? Unemployment is down because people can&#39;t afford to live on one jobs salary and are working two or more shity paying jobs at a time. The stock market is a false indicator of how well the economy is doing. It is reflecting record trades in dollars that aren&#39;t worth half of what they were 10 years prior to hitting the 20,000 mark because there are virtually billions if not trillions of paper money circulating out here without the value of a quarter. <br />It is the age of spin a real estate conman is President and the government doesn&#39;t want the public to know how really screwed they are. The is about to hit the fan again though we are broke. People like Bolton think a war might get us some money he hasn&#39;t been paying attention. Irag, Afganastan, and Syria are the reason we are printing dollars like they&#39;re real money. A real war wouldn&#39;t help.<br />We go socialist and treat people fairly or we go full blown medieval and open up debtors prisons again. What a thing for the beacon of democracy to be considering.Dems should take her approach, they would sound much more saneFuck S.C. carpet muncherYou always hear these people talking about &quot;Why don&#39;t liberals do more to appeal to republicans?&quot;. Yet you never hear them asking republicans why they aren&#39;t doing anything to appeal to liberals. And most of the country actually support liberal ideas.Her commentary was lameShame On You CNN. Shitty reporting like this is exactly what makes Cult45 call you fake news. If you want to be taken seriously report actual facts and not right wing opinions.CNN is so cringe....The democratic candidates were speaking to those voters. Tuition free college for those in middle and lower income benefits them too. Affordable or lower cost healthcare resembling what other nations have goes for them too. A plan to address wealth distribution and income inequality and decent paid parental leave would apply to them as would an increase in wages. Just because they didn‚Äôt hold their hands and specifically say ‚Äúthis is something special for those who voted for Trump but now realize it was a dumb move‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they weren‚Äôt also speaking to them. It‚Äôs not their job to pat them on the head and coddle them. I like SE Cupp ok. I disagree with her sometimes as I am more on the progressive side but she seems reasonable. But here I think she‚Äôs just off.Democrats have no chance to beat Trump.Defending Joe Biden like he did, Donald Trump show that he is scared silly of Kamala Harris.big ol tittiesTwo girls one SE Cupp.Could Cupp be a more obvious establishment shill?Skank ass Trump, is so afraid of debating anybody else but Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden. Remember, he is very famous, for deviating from the subject, for name calling, for tantrum-throwing, for interrupting when others are speaking, and being his normal sickening, disgusting, fucked up self!&quot;Why weren&#39;t all the democrarts centrist corporate husks like us?&quot;Look at the like to dislike ratio‚Äîway more dislikes.

President Donald Trump promised during his campaign that he would balance the budget.The total debt surpassed $22 trillion for the first time ever in February ‚Äî $2 trillion higher than when Trump took office.<br />The massive shortfall is being attributed to a 20 percent drop in corporate revenue and increased federal spending.The Trump administration slashed corporate taxes in his new 2017 tax law from 35 percent to 21 percent. Trump‚Äôs tax-cut package cost the government $1.5 trillion.This lady‚Äôs is trashThis bitch  ...cNN is crying the blues&quot;...as they &quot;portended it to be&quot;....what a douche...Fuck you S.E. your miserable party does nothing but, fuck things up and spew bile all day every day. You have no ideas as how to make people&#39;s lives better. Whether you want to acknowledge it or not, we don&#39;t let people die because they don&#39;t have insurance. We&#39;re all going to pay regardless. This is something dumbass Republicans can&#39;t understand no matter how many times it&#39;s explained. And, Democrats are not calling for no restrictions on abortion. STFU and stop trying to repeal Roe v. Wade - which does have restrictions - and we can all move with our lives. An educated population helps EVERYONE and if shit-head Republicans would get out of the way - those people could become citizens and we could move on with our lives.Let&#39;s turn your own argument upside down concerning M4A. Many people use an argument that no one should be forced to drop their current insurance in favor of M4A. Citing a number of reasons with the ineptness of government run services being paramount. Quite often this argument is accompanied by suggestions that reliance on government is unhealthy for a society and that being forced to contribute to the well being of others is not in anyone&#39;s best interest.<br />What gives people using these arguments the right to expect the government to guarantee that their private insurance remains viable?<br />Set up M4A and let anyone who opts out of it to remain on their private insurance if they so choose. A simple tax credit can differentiate between the privately insured and M4A users to offset the inevitable tax increase.<br />Tough cookies if the insured pool becomes so small that your premiums rise tenfold and/or private insurance companies begin to pull out of the market.Winston Churchill????? Ok do trump visits the Queen and all of a sudden he is an expert on what Churchill would say.

Establishment cucksCNN = communist news networkWow, I watch CNN to consistently see the overwhelming bias for Alt-left Democrat‚Äôs values so this is completely surprising.  I suspect they are realizing Trump is correct or they are merely just spinning anything to get viewers back who are tired of having media feed them crap.  Sad the the word ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô actually applies more to Conservative Republicans because there is nothing democratic about the Democrats.The closest Trump will get to Winston Churchill is the bust behind him on the table in the Oval Office ( except perhaps his time in the Dardanelles.)OH PLEASE; Cry me a riverThis lady nailed itFinally someone on cnn is call out the crazy DemsThis lady is absolutely full of shit. I&#39;m not watching the next seven minutes of this shithead.CNN Please bring multiple Republican Anchors for this time slot.

We should not be spending our limited tax dollars on more illegal and fake asylum seekers. Deport all nowCUPP HERSELF IS A NOBODY&quot;Some people like their insurance and want to keep them&quot; yeah, the 1% you retarded shill.This is a primary. In every primary election Republicans try to portray themselves as the most conservative and democrats try to position themselves as the most liberal. Thats totally normal. This is not the stage  in an election where you try to reach disaffected Trump voters. You need to get out of the primary first and then worry about a general election.W O W.<br />CNN is attepting to get some of the Trump supporters BACK !! MORE AND MORE DESPERATELY BY THE MIN. It no longer matters to buffoon and contradict themselves. All SPINES JUST rotting.<br />This strategy that they are pulling lately may work for morons but is SUPER TRANSPARENT! SOOO INSINCERE. Shows EVEN MORE HOW THEY HAVE NO spine !<br /> It is a little too late to try and be somewhat levelled now. You have lost sooo much audience people only watch you for mockery now. No one respects you unless they are diluted. Go on pretend that you see the truth but you constantly attack the truth and any second will sell out again. Once a traitor always a traitor to your own people. Entertaining BUT NOT NEWS.Good job cnnSE Cupp is so dorkyI agree with her. If the Dems keep this strategy up, TRUMP will definitely be re-elected -- for sure! -- not a good situationWhat nonsense.  Where were the calls in 2016 to have the Republicans try and appeal to non-Republicans??  I&#39;m not a Democrat, and enjoy a good Democratic Establishment bashing as the next person, but it has to be good.She is not wrong.Why doesn&#39;t anyone ever talk about how  the Right needs to try to attract the centerist Leftists?<br />Why should the Left need to try to attract people from a party of democracy-killing, bigoted extremists?<br /><br />These &quot;What-happened-to-my-party&quot; Republicans aren&#39;t accepting the reality that the only thing that&#39;s happened to conservatism is that it has come to it&#39;s natural conclusion- a party of racist, bigoted, nationalist, authoritarian, anti-science, pro-business, religious ignorance.I hope it&#39;s as obvious to others as it is to me how media tries to manipulate people into believing that progressive liberal policies are bad, so democrats should be more moderate. I do t know where they are getting those notions, but it&#39;s not from liberals! I would suggest that we are sick, tired, and fed up with middle of the road more conservative bipartisan policies that screw us all over! What does appeal to us is strong decisive leftist policies and politicians that are not going to be afraid to implement them and will finally bring some relief into our lives instead of these fearful half hearted, throw us a bone in order to mollify the republicans kind of policies! We need pit bulls, not moderates!!! I don&#39;t want to keep hearing we should want something weaker because WE DONT! My vote will go to the one who stands up to them the strongest to strip the right of their fascist power!No... You&#39;re dumb.  You&#39;re an abomination of news and journalism.  Seriously, you don&#39;t bother bringing facts to the table, rather you just bring your uneducated option on air and tell at all if us, and scream that we&#39;re wrong. Wow... Just wow.Two thousand dislikes..... OUCH CNN. üòÖüòÖüòÖWow. Who would have thought you would here a sliver of sanity from CNN?Sorry,  while your stoking fear of innocent brown people coming here seeking a better life as a threat, Trump is getting ever cozier to PUTIN and why aren&#39;t you talking about why he told US it was NONE OF OUR BUSINESS??

Republicans don‚Äôt have problems with their local governments getting so deep in their lives that they know more about you than you yourself probably do. So give it a fucking break. Plus there was  plenty of liars on that debate stage that wouldn‚Äôt be the progressive they are stating they would be. Take Harris for example who did the best out of both nights. She‚Äôs no progressive, and you can trust her to be the corporatist shill you seem to want up there. And what about Biden, Hickenlooper, Delaney, or the others no one actually remembers their names. So bite me.Why does SE Cupp look like she&#39;s sitting on a vibrator?The answer is: YangHis name is Andy NgoAn intelligent CNN reporter.   I would definitely suck on her clit.Trump has 2020 in the bag. Thanks dimocrats.What the fuck is this woman talking about?!  Of course the politicians are supposed to know better than us!  If all the politicians do is tell us we&#39;re right about everything and try to appease the populace, then they are POPULIST DEMAGOGUES who are inevitably extremely shitty to have in power BECAUSE THEY DON&#39;T MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR OWN ETHICS AND IDEALS<br /><br />HOW fucking stupid is this woman and why the fuck is she on TV saying absolute insane things as if they&#39;re true what the FUCK cnnProof the Democrat Polititions are all Freaks just like the freaks in there voter base.

Though of course you show absolutely no facts to justify your assumption that people don&#39;t want things like universal health coverage.she just wants to be right....does not know how stupid she sounds and how far away she is on the issues - poor millionaire thingLove SC Cupp but she like all right leading Republicans, is just flat out wrong. Republicans are historical known for cutting taxes for the one percent in hopes that there would be a triple down effect. It has never worked. Hoover tried it and it lead to &quot;The Great Depression&quot; Reagan tried it and it brought about the &quot;Great Deficit&quot;. George W. Bush tried it and it lead to the &quot;Great Recession&quot; and now Donald Trump tax break for the one percent will likely lead to the &quot;Great Collapse of Democracy&quot;. Right now Donald Trump is enjoying the trajectory of Obama&#39;s economy just like Bush enjoyed the trajectory of Clinton&#39;s economy. With the Russian&#39;s assistance in the election Donald Trump will attempt to become the &quot;President for Life&quot; and this cause the constitutional crisis. Liberal Democrats should follow the historical example of Franklin D. Roosevelt who used Keynes economic principles invested throughout the United States and revitalize America. The right called it socialism but it brought about greatest economic boom the world has ever seen.. It is just simple!!!Who gives a fuck about the &quot;dissaffected moderate Trump voters&quot;?  Either they know he&#39;s a racist rapacious sociopath who has ZERO interest in helping them, or they&#39;re insane nuts about either guns, abortion, or race and they would never vote democrat anyway.<br /><br />The truth is, nobody wants a &quot;moderate&quot; anymore because &quot;moderate&quot; is code for &quot;bought out by corporate interests and maintaining the miserable status quo at all costs&quot;.  SE Cupp is a rich cunt without half a fucking clue what real people are going to assess to decided who to vote for in 2020.The Democrats talked about helping every body but Americans they hate America we know it which is why I&#39;m voteing TrumpYeah, like the democrats running to the right worked well for them during 2016. I mean, what could possibly happen? We would elect someone like Trump?This has a strong FOx news feelShe got sum tig ol bitties üôÉTrump is an imbecile.  He doesn&#39;t even know what basic political terms mean, he had no clue that Putin&#39;s recent words were actual threats to Western ideals...he is an unwitting Russian Asset.  wow America are you proud yet?Babylon  American you will  be burning  up with hell fire  and  world war  3 coming  and  these  last daysWow i cant believe im hearing this in cnn!üòÆIncredibly funny too hear someone from CNN call anybody stupid your a joke of a news organization your left wing propagandaYou&#39;re not entirely correct, SE; Joe Biden did dog whistle with his appeal to states rights. That&#39;s a clear attempt to reach out to Trump voters. If you look at Biden, he&#39;s trying to be a Trump, right down to the meaningless hyperbole (he doesn&#39;t have a racist bone in his body, not even his small toe!)<br /><br />Joe Biden is your smart strategy, and if it works, we&#39;re all doomed. üòûThumbs down cause no low cut topHey CNN, no one is listening to you anymore. The jig is up.Most Americans are actually Libertarian and if they started voting Libertarian this country would be better off.I&#39;ve seen a dumber plan than anything the Dems have offered - (1) say that Kamela Harris isn&#39;t black enough to be President and (2) base the entire play on &quot;we&#39;ll see what happens&quot;.  If American football were run like that, all the quarterbacks would be instantly fired and the paper bag test would be back in style.Is this a cnn show?

Who the fuck do you think your fooling, moron.Trump wins again.What a cunt. She literally has one of the most cunt faces I have ever seen.BS.....Then go vote republican you dumb bitch. Fuck you and the centrists. Y&#39;all gave the country to the Republicans. Centrists never fight back. We need real leftists in officeUmm SE, you are definitely a propagandist.  ALL of the &quot;weird lefty&quot; proposals (ex. Healthcare for illegals) were proposed by your news station at the debates, even though they are not KEY proposals by the candidates. Also, you being a &quot;journalist&quot; would have known that the MAJORITY of people in an aggregate of polls support M4A, living wage, smart gun control, stopping regime change wars, etc...and candidates like Bernie, Warren, Yang, and Tulsi are resonating in key Trump states such as Wisconsin and Michigan...but then again, I&#39;m no one;  just a reader of objective data and semi-skilled user of Google.  So WTF are you talking about SE??!?!?!?!demmys loved her until she disagrees  now demmys turn on her      wowYou cannot cross the isle if you denigrate your peer&#39;s personal standing and get a bill passed. Joe Biden knows that and in those days that he fell short of todays expectations, he failed in our eyes but succeeded in keeping some progress back then where none other would have prevailed. In short he patronized those across the isle to get them to support at least what little progress he could get passed and straddling that fence he is now up where we all can get a good look at those old days and way&#39;s, but we all know that he meant well by his life&#39;s history. God Bless you Joe, I don&#39;t think we could have done any better back then either.Let&#39;s stop all immigration, like our nation did from the 1920&#39;s thru the 1960&#39;s, until those millions of invaders (called undocumented by the indoctrinated) are, identified and checked for illness then, adjudicated. Maybe, folks attempting to emigrate legally will pressure democrats to start working for our Representative Constitutional Republic, instead of the international left.Let&#39;s take everyone&#39;s private health care away and give it to undocumented immigrantsCuppa is out of touch. Are the Democrats not supposed to come up with policy and be more racist? Because we&#39;re almost there with BidenI wish people who stop saying free college tuition, free healthcare. It&#39;s not free. You pay more in taxes so its not free. Its just that you don&#39;t personally right a check or run yiur debit card to pay your college or pay for your prescriptions etc.They&#39;re all the same idiot that&#39;s the biggest thing they have in common. They&#39;re all promising the almost exact same impossible stupid type of things. Why doesn&#39;t one of them promise to pay back everyone&#39;s social security that they have paid in over the years, at a 10% return. At least that would be original, except for the impossibly stupid part.Trump&#39;s opinion is just another worm infested polished turd. END THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PERMANENTLY. Stop watching the Donny gasbag elephant lying stench bag and pay attention to the laws that are being passed and the money that&#39;s being stolen. Another race to the bottom brought to you by the ever hateful and selfish Republican Party and conservative Americans. Living off the blood and sweat of compassionate and better people. Like you.democrats raise their hands because it takes no thought.The Democrats tried to &quot;outleft&quot; each other? Are you serious? I for one think that none of these candidates is left enough.

She‚Äôs big money Washington and he‚Äôs helping her raise a ton of money BUT....to say that every democratic candidate is wrong, is just ignorant. Especially coming from a white, millionaire news anchor woman who can afford to sit in her ivory tower and judge.Like listening to Fox news with the spinning the b*<b>****</b>News flash SE Cupp....Party debates flow on either conservative, or progressive ideals. Then when the parties meet for the national debates for president, the move to the middle commence...just like elections in the past.Which devil did Trump promise his soul to that he gets away with everything? He goes on tv saying how America is a big old trash heap and we&#39;re all falling apart and all Mexicans are rapists -- and he got voted in. He verifiably lies so much we can&#39;t count it anymore. But when Kamala Harris lies about listening to Snoop or whatever in college when he hadn&#39;t been in the scene yet, or someone says the economy isn&#39;t great -- people are like &quot;they&#39;re despicable! They&#39;re NO DIFFERENT.&quot; Here&#39;s news: a person who tosses an empty soda can on the sidewalk IS DIFFERENT than a person who walks up to you and dumps a trashcan of wet garbage over your head.

So she mischaracterizes half the stuff Democratic candidates said and even the stuff she summaries correctly she all deems radical. Yeah Radical that stuff that most other modern developed countries have like Universal college, Healthcare, and civil charge for illegal entree into a country not a criminal one. It&#39;s called a balance not radical shit lol not everything should include a Profit motive like building roads unless you want toll roads every fucking where, or Healthcare, or war unless you want endless wars. Somethings don&#39;t generate profits but still need to be done in a society like law enforcement, fire fighting, educating our youth, healthcare for our citizens and we should do our best in these areas for the citizens by funding them enough just like how we fund the heck out of our military because it&#39;s important in our society lol some basics need to be established. The Ferraris and Porsches you leave to the markets to determine what they&#39;re worth to people because they&#39;re not essential to have a strong cohesive society like paved roads or healthcare for developed society.CNN ratings making them tell the truth and hire real news anchorsSo appease the the voters that didn‚Äôt vote for you and lose the voters that did. Smart strategy ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This is literally ignorant.What they also need to hit home is the fact that this man is writing these blank checks for any amount. This is why we had the housing crises and recession in 2009. Bush was just spending money like crazy and letting future generations to pay for it. This is going to happen again because Trump don&#39;t care who&#39;s going to pay for it because he will have made billions off his presidency and he will have money and he won&#39;t care about the people strugglingHaving a name tag of trump hater even doesn‚Äôt fit you fake newscaster.

I would vote against anyone who says this is a good idea!!!!!!!!!!!!Van jones is a fucking hack, people who pay for insurance would get better VALUE with Medicare for all. Why would I want to pay $2000 a month towards my healthcare compared to $1000?

Let me straw man your positions and claim they&#39;re crazy.....advertisers and health insurance lobbyist...did I say that right? <b>smiles and counts money</b>Lol what was trump saying? he really doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about.Since when did Fox news buy CNN.Healthcare for the undocumented means lower costs for everyone, since they won‚Äôt wait until they have to go to an emergency room. Plus they won‚Äôt be a risk to the general population by harboring untreated infectious disease. Also, the undocumented make crucial contributions to our tax collection and Social Security.<br /><br />These are all points made at the debate. It‚Äôs not only more humane. It makes more sense fiscally and for the public safety.The leftward tilt is what defines Dems who aren‚Äôt corporate sellouts. Vote republican if you want only what‚Äôs best for corporations, build stupid walls &amp; keep people sick.DEMS = OPEN BORDERS AND MORE ILLEGALS, AND ILLEGALS GET EVERYTHING FOR FREE.

But free healthcare for illegal aliensGo to fox!! This was a DEMOCRATIC debate, you&#39;re asking why there weren&#39;t any Republicans running in the DEMOCRATIC party against Donald Trump. How about asking why there&#39;s no one primaring Donald Trump as the Republican candidate!What a stupid C00N and ignant.All the Democrats who are running for the Presidency of the United States are so radical far left progressive that they are sounding Anti American and they support Illegal immigration over veteran&#39;s who have fought and sacrificed their lives.A majority do NOT WANT money out of politics and media? A majority want private insurance? A majority want tax cuts that heavily favor the ultra wealthy? A majority want insane student debt NOT relieved? A majority think climate change is a hoax? A majority want nothing done for our infrastructure? A majority want the status quo? NO....SE Cupp....America has had enough of your spin and want real policies that positively affect their lives....you&#39;re in the bubble....NOT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO WANT REAL CHANGE!!!what a establishment shill...CNN is clearly threatened and stepping up their smearing and misinformationWow, even CNN seems it&#39;s a dismal bunch of hoodlumsThis is  concern trolling at its finest. How come Republicans are never asked to be inclusive?SE Cupp just gave us her real position. Shes a trumper.. ffsYOU HAVE TO HAVE HEALTH TO RIDE THE <a href="http://subway.you/">SUBWAY.YOU</a> ARSES ARE BOUGHT.MAYOR PETE HAD A SECRET MEETING WITH <a href="http://nancy.money/">NANCY.MONEY</a> TO CAMPAIGN.CNN AND CNBSN ARE CORRUPT.Tbh the candidates weren&#39;t liberal enough.So she is saying is if you don&#39;t think like a Republican then you&#39;re fucked?Who is this dumb broad? Give me a break. This is not about reaching Trumps dumbass voters..this is about fixing the state of our union. She is incredibly idiotic. Go to Fox, you idget.‚ÄúImmigrants who come here illegally‚Äù? SE, have some intellectual honesty and call it what it is- ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION!Urgh. Cupp is a waste of space.Sanders 2020  wake up it&#39;s what the people want !The fake news Channel CNN.This central park 5 racist pedophile proves everyday how fucked up Americans really are.  They put this garbage in office to lead them.Hilarious watching the demtard candidate clown car ü§°Wowser, that looks like a DD Cupp to me. Just sayin&#39;. . .Donut girl you need to cut back your face is looking real large on CNNüòÇCupp! You got something right. I didn‚Äôt think you had it in youShe doesn&#39;t know what the hell she&#39;s talking aboutSo it only matters what Republicans want. What happens when Democrats ask for laws on guns? Well Republicans throw fits! Insurance companies are screwing people there should be reform. It would be nice if the religious people followed what Jesus would do instead of being hypocrites!FUCK CNN!I&#39;m impressed! The truth on cnn! You go girl!!!!Wth.... EVERYTHING she said is EXACTLY what the Republicans have done for decades.go to breitbart you ugly bitchSE Cupp is correct.¬† The debates were too left-wing for the majority of Americans.Trump 2020!üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏Fair play to cnn reporter  for speaking the truth!!!!!!!!This chick needs to be on FOX News.  I thought this was Megan for a minute.  Get her two-faced a$$ and personal Republican views outa here.  I wonder if she received a &#39;token of appreciation&#39; to say what she did.SE CUPP, fine asf,  idc what ppl say.  Dem or Republican...I love herSo you snowflakes want to talk s*** just because it&#39;s impossible for even a liar network like fake news CNN to say the Democrats have a snowball&#39;s chance in hell? A bunch of chumps. You leftist swine will cry those salty liberal tears come 2020!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%234moreyears">#4moreyears</a>To be fair, I get SE Cup is stating the possibility the Dems are &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; rather than trying to sell, or garner votes from Trump base (ie:. attack Trump). I believe Dems are doing this because they believe Trump won because too many dem voters abstained.I wish they would trade this woman with Juan Williams. That would be a fair and a welcome trade over at Fox News.Also who asked that president ttump. for his opinion on  how the candidates did ?  Does anybody give a rat&#39;s. a*<b>*</b>  what he thinks ?Van Jones is stretching delusional thinking. He&#39;d be better of with Cooper and Lemon and they can have a three way pillow biting fight.Omg this woman should be the face of CNN and maybe they‚Äôll get their views backOk, ok, that&#39;s mostly fair but if you are satisfied by current healthcare coverage you actually are objectively wrong. I pay $350/mo for spectacular insurance (out of pocket, but most people with job insurance don&#39;t realize they&#39;re paying out of their checks before they get paid).  I also cover 100% of my employees&#39; insurance. If all healthcare became free, we&#39;d all get way better coverage (as in everything you need) and I&#39;d raise their salaries based on the money I&#39;m saving (because I don&#39;t own business to be the richest person I know, I do it for personal freedom and to contribute something positive to society). Medicare is irrelevant in free healthcare plans. You go to a doctor, it&#39;s paid for. It&#39;s not that complicated. Just like insurance companies who overcharge to make their profits, the government will never deplete the pooled budget. Plus the money they save goes back into society, not into horrible business leaders&#39; pockets.Get your facts straight.Medicare for all is polling at 70%. The economy is great for you, because your a privileged white girl. Not everyone lives your lifestyle. Van Jones makes his living working for CNN, of course he&#39;s sympathetic to their interests. Your talking points are misinformed. This is why corporate media is losing legitimacy.We have an idiot for presidentRace has always been an issue. White people know they need to be deported along with everyone else who are not linked through bloodlines to the land.Dems crashed and burned big time, Trump is going to be a 2 term president, and he knows it now.CNN is doing betterIF THAT  D U M B O  WON BY GOING ALL THE WAY OUT IN ORDER TO Satisfy his toxic base...who won&#39;t  vote for Democrats  anyway,there aught to be no reason why  the Democrats  should not appeal to their base.She got the hanging tittsDemocrats are going for the voters who don&#39;t want to work and want a free ride.  Yeah tax the working people to death.  It&#39;s going to make the working people quit their jobs go to college for free.Full tilt or Full Tard one and the same? The democrats have no message other than handing out free stuff, that they know will never happen. Just more lies from a bunch of communists. This is one of the dumbest groups I&#39;ve seen.Australia has health care system for all but 40 of the public still get private insurance that they don&#39;t even needYou should know by the blonde hair that she&#39;s a trump supporterThis is what self destruction looks like. The crazy policy proposals to appease the radical left won&#39;t win the American electorate. The U.S. voters want to know what will a candidate do to improve THEIR lives and how to keep the country on the road to prosperity. This humanitarian and equality stuff doesn&#39;t affect most Americans so there is zero chance of winning on such a platform.Every weekend she and Smercomish do this. On another note, this woman has the most ironic name I&#39;ve ever seen.Lol... Bunch of liberals mad at S.E. Cupp for telling the truth. What are you thinking S.E. Cupp?? CNN only delivers fake news, how dare you say the truth! Lol... Bunch of butt hurt useful idiots who keep voting for the same democrats that keep destroying their own states. Literally EVERY liberal state is a shithole right now, how the hell do you morons not see that??!! Unbelievable...S.e. cupp, you must be one of the dumbest blondes on tv. Youre good for looking at, but when you open your mouth and words come out, being hot isnt enough to save you from spewing idiocy. Ill keep staring at your boobs and ignore you trying to push out anyone who isnt an undercover Republican. But save political commentary for women who arent idiots. You and megan mccain are both idiots. Id be cool with a 3some but if it involves speaking, im muting both of you until you run out of talking points.Talk about full of sh** S.E.  seems to be over filled. Corporate much?Private health insurance is a private tax. Eliminating the private tax would save the average household $5,000 a year because the government can do it cheaper and better. We are the only industrialized nation that doesn&#39;t have a national Healthcare System.Note to SE Cupp  Democrats won&#39;t win by trying to cozy up to Republican, or Corporatist  policies, they will win by bringing people to the polls who in the past have not bothered to make a choice between a Corporate Crony Democrat and a Corporate Crony Republican.  Trump and the Republicans have their 42% to 45% of the normal electorate.  That might be enough to hold on given the electoral college; however, that Republican fraction gets smaller as the Democratic Party can bring in former non-voters, nearly all of whom will be from the left, and will only come out if they can see a reason to hope that the government will care about them and not about the Corporate Kleptocracy.&quot;A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from the Public Treasury. <br /><br />From that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with a result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy always followed by dictatorship. <br /><br />The average age of the world&#39;s greatest civilizations has been 200 years.&quot;   <br /><br />Alexander Fraser Tytler- &quot;Decline and Fall of the Athenian Republic&quot;Since we&#39;re doing it anyway, let&#39;s do it above board and smart. That&#39;s what he said regarding free healthcare for non-Americans. The doing it anyway, refers to emergency room care. It&#39;s thinking like this that demonstrates the inability of the left.... flawed conclusions based on flawed initial assumptions. The left believes that genius is common in their party. I believe that whatever intellectual prowess exists with the left, is also myopic.Wow I‚Äôm pretty sure putting your opinion via cnn is fucking stupid. You‚Äôre opinions suck ass. And stop copying Ana Kasparian‚Äôs ORIGINAL unfiltered. She does it much better, stop while you‚Äôre ahead you ignorant ass.Wow she sexy in that white top. Very interesting commentary.That must be the dumbest ‚Äòpolitical analysis‚Äô I‚Äôve ever seen on CNN. Who is she? Is she new or just trying very hard to re-establish herself? If you don‚Äôt want to contribute to the society and pay taxes, to help the society as a whole gain education, if you don‚Äôt want to pay taxes to provide medical care for all citizens (and, like in other sane countries with public healthcare, still have an option to use your fat pay check to go private), if you think that record low unemployment is more important than full-time jobs that pay a living wage - then perhaps you‚Äôre not really a moderate? Perhaps you‚Äôre just a neoliberal douche?Trump deals with the creepy liars of the progressive party &amp; news what&#39;s the difference?Well you finally said something intelligent. Progressive Way is the only way. yes the rest of you are wrong, get over it. We&#39;ve been suffering from Reagan economics and other Extreme conservative ideas like tax cuts for the rich, defending education, restricting a woman&#39;s right to choose, the war on drugs,...........I THINK YOURE DUMB ALONG WITH CNN FAKE  NEWSDon&#39;t start off with Korea having a Historical change for the good that actually makes a real difference in the world...Hmmm who would have thought DONALD TRUMP DID SOMETHING AMAZING IN KOREA... yeah CNN you have one of the dumbest strategies ever completely  ignore the Face the TRUMP WENT TO KOREA and MET with they&#39;re leader  to unite NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA for the first time  in a historically long period of time.  Trump or not the president of United States, the leader of your country did something good and for once Trump deserves acknowledgement.... and not a single word or CNN camera there when it happened...BOOOO BUUUUUU grow the fuck up and back your president on something news worthy....get over his racist orange ass and work with him....BUSH, CLINTON and OBAMA did what exactly in they&#39;re time in office? Nothing peaceful and historical, they just ramped up the interventionist  Foreign policy that started a lot of the turmoil in the middle east....How many countries Sovereignty has been ignored and blatantly used to start the war drums for the military complex? CNN you might as well pack it in and lay off all your new anchors... ALL of them....you get paid too much to push a negative message and don&#39;t spend near enough time doing research on the topics to the point you don&#39;t even make retractions and clarify the fucking truth when you get proven wrong by Comedians like Lee Camp, Jimmy Dore and Phillip Defranco....you used to be cool CNN, what happened too scared to stop readin the teleprompter and speak your own mind in fear of retaliation or unemployment? Fuck even Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast has more relevant content and research on the topics...What a farce of comedic bafoonery. America, your vote counts for nothing. The ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS A WHITE DEVIL SAFEGUARD TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THIS STOLEN COUNTRY.<br />Regardless, TrumpSatan won the presidency by losing close to 3 million votes. Yet he won because he won 4 key electoral states. Mainly Ohio, and Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, These 4 states are filled to the Brim with white devil squirrel slurpers. Haters of Black and Brown people.<br />Racist white devil&#39;s are what they are. And I am calling you devil&#39;s out on this.<br />Kerner Commission findings. Ebony&#39;s barometer of How Much of Martin Luther Kings dream has become reality. Studies are being done all over about this racist evil country&#39;s Race problems.<br />Joe Biden supported those Racist white devil&#39;s who eventually left the Dumbocrats and became permanent fixated Vampires for the Repooplicans. Joe Biden made mistakes, yet he is smart enough to confront them, and form a consensus. Give Miss Kamala Harris credit for calling you white people out on this. You whites, MOST OF YOU,  DID NOT WANT YOUR CHILDREN LEARNING WITH BLACK CHILDREN BE HONEST. I KNOW IT IS HARD FOR YOU DEVILS TO ACCEPT THIS HARD TRUTH. BUT IT IS VERY NECESSARY, SO THEY WILL BE NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS!<br />In 1954 Thurgood Marshall and 8 other Supreme Court Justices desegregated schools. All one has to do is look at you devil&#39;s berating, spitting, and using some of the foulest language, discouraging and blocking the doors for Black children to be educated. Your evil forbears denied blacks reading and writing for over 350 years. Let me inform you Khazarians of what was done to black slaves caught reading, and trying to educate themselves. They were severly beaten, and had a wooden bodkin thrust through their tongues. Or they were branded on the sides of their faces. Oh yeah white people, you need to be acquainted with your evil forbears devilish behavior.<br />When master white devil raped and impregnated his black female slaves. Some they would tie to 2 horses and split the pregnant slave into 2 pieces and the baby would fall out. And your evil wicked forbears would use their boots to crush that baby&#39;s skull. This is true accounts of your evil forbears wickedness, that you evil white people get that constipated look on your faces when talked about.<br />God has weighed your deeds and Actions America. And God has found you very lacking in JUSTICE, AND EQUALITY, TWO NOBLE TRAITS NOT FOUND IN MOST OF YOU WHITE DEVILS.<br />I will conclude with a letter from Henry Beery a devil Representative in the Virginia house of Burgess in 1733:<br />WE HAVE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, CLOSED EVERY AVENUE BY WHICH THE LIGHT, MAY ENTER INTO THE BLACK SLAVES MIND <br />IF WE COULD EXTINGUISH THE CAPACITY TO SEE THE LIGHT, OUR WORK WILL BE COMPLETE.<br />THIS WOULD THEN PUT THE SLAVE ON THE LEVEL OF THE BEAST OF THE FIELD. AND THEN WHITE DEVILS WILL FEEL SAFE.<br />You see America, if you study white people and white devildom in general. You will find Henry Beery, Willie Lynch, and a litany of white devil&#39;s who systematically, psychologically, and physically humiliated and destroyed my people. If you evil devil&#39;s think you will ever rule over us again. You devil&#39;s have a good ASS WHUPPIN COMING. AND ME AND 2 MILLION ANGRY STRONG BLACKMEN ARE READY TO GIVE IT TO YOU!Trump earned alot of money for the nation n made the US economy to upward position which obama messed up with no way out. Economy is the oxygen for the nation to surviveYou all should really take a look at medicare !  I am retired and on it and have not used it to date !  If you think I would trust any GOVERNMENT health care with my health , think again !!! You have to ask why so many seniors are dying at such young ages, a big spike in heart problems ???  What is with that super flu shot for the seniors , 2 of my friends died 2 weeks after getting them ???  We need to return to the natural doctors ! When I was young I was having some problems - went to the doctor , they tried to tell me I was depressed - I said no , that my body seemed out of balance - they tried to push the pills ! I said no - went to a natural doctor , described my problem -  He pulled the skin down around my eyes and told me I needed IRON AND B COMPLEX gave me shots for a week and I felt better than I had in years !!! The cures are there- the cabal would not let us have them !!Keep calm and respect AmericaShe is an idiotYes exactly you are wrong ! And that&#39;s called education !<br />NO the economy is not great ! The stock market is great...<br />If you think your healtcare plan is great they you are wrong. You would be better of with Medicare !<br />SE Cupp: you are an idiot&quot;People who want to keep their private health insurance&quot; are an invention of Big Business. Private insurance means no job=no health care. This is the claim that you love to live with the risk that, if something goes wrong, you and your family could end up without health care. America&#39;s wonderful private health care means that the USA has a worse child mortality rate than Cuba!<br /><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html</a><br />America&#39;s rate of food poisoning is 10  times higher than the rate in the UK- it means big food companies in the US make more money than big food companies in the UK. SE Cupp would tell you that you enjoy America&#39;s poor food hygiene if the big companies told her to.<br />Make sure that the thing that big business is most frightened of doesn&#39;t happen. Keep the Democratic party as a cheap copy of the Republicans and let big business keep killing Americans because it maximises their profits.Wait... this happened on CNN? This poor woman is going to be hit with some kind of scandal or strangely disappear. Watch your back darlin‚Äô!<br /><br />Edit: The second option is that this is CNN‚Äôs version of pandering. In this case a host that speaks conservative instead of Spanish üòÇMy God she is disgusting. Solidarity is not in her mind. Does she now What IT means?Cupp just said my truth.Where are all of the Democratic candidates who want abortion restriction, don&#39;t want to pay taxes, and want to keep the current healthcare system? Um, there aren&#39;t any, you&#39;re on the wrong propaganda channel, lady. Lmao. Oh, CNN....Sc cum cupp lose some weight you cow you&#39;re on TV because you think you&#39;re so great.You two don&#39;t understand &quot;Medicare for all&quot; at all.  It can cover everyone but if you also want private insurance of course you can buy it.  That&#39;s how Medicare has always worked.majority disagrees with you cnn. Dems will be fine.she&#39;s 100% right Dems looked like a bunch of lunatic radicals on the debate stage ,no chance to beat Trump in 2020War or peace... the signular focus.. Larouche PAC YouTube channel...you really should check it out if you want to know . .I DARE you... don&#39;t you want to know....I‚Äôm surprised she could speak with that metaphorical elephants dick in her mouth.  I‚Äôm never watching a video with her in it again.  This is the problem with CNN.  They claim to be unbiased but then you see things like this.  This isn‚Äôt based in any realm of fact whatsoever.  Trump has a 36% approval rating in America.  Why pander to that audience?  Medicare for all has a 70% approval rating in America, how is that pandering to the left? lol<br />Maybe they should be polling for other things popularity and if it‚Äôs higher than trumps approval rating, logically speaking, how you get votes from both sides NOT being republican lite.Please send her back to Fox so she can learn to speak Russian.She&#39;s a closet lesbian tooAnother example of a CLUELESS human thinking they know what they are talking about. She and Meghan McCain should just be cancelled already. Like we need more CLUELESS WHITE BITCHES TALKING SHIT&gt;&gt;&gt; NEXT. and get new glasses bitch, you look stupid as fuck.. trying way way way to hardBiden is so over üôÑüôÑüôÑFor anyone confused about S E Cupps&#39; take on democrat platform ---------&gt; she&#39;s a republican. So is Nicole Wallace, by the way &amp; there are probably many more republicans paid to comment on progressive ideas on liberal corporate media under the guise that they are democrats.To the &quot;Is this Fox?&quot; folks.  No, I am progressive and vehemently anti-Trump, but she has points.  The candidates gave soundbite ammo to conservatives that will be hard to defend against.My first time liking a CNN clip ( I feel dirty ) .... are they finally seeing reality ???... I can&#39;t wait to see worst journalist of the year ...Don Lemon... worst journalist of the years reaction to thisYes you wrong,  I wonder when people will be understand economy, <br />Is only one tools to measure economy is good or not !!!!<br />It is you Bank saving account! !!!!<br />If you saving go up economy is good if go down economy is bad so no by idiot and don&#39;t alaud political clowns washing you brain with propaganda !!!<br />Remember you can have job and make 1.000.000 dollars per hour if you can&#39;t save from this one milion dollar a penny because you spend all for bills then economy is very bad. <br />So to know how economy is good look you own bank saving account and you have answer !!!!!Trump just crossed the DMZ and is walking into North Korea!  Historic!S E your snowflake audience can&#39;t deal with sane and rational dialect. Look how butt hurt they all are in the comments. Probably use to losing, seeing that&#39;s all you Dims do!There was a debate?You can have all the free stuff you want but not the quality or quantity.In the first 3.30 minutes of the video, everything was sadly fake fox talking points. She misses all the context that goes in with these issues and why they are actually important to dig into  further. She made a giant sound bite for fake fox. Hopefully, voters will do their homework and go to the candidates websites and get the reasoning behind these ideas. Remember if the rich can get 1.5 trillion in tax breaks for the rich and still waiting on my 10%. We can pay for other things too.CNN keep having clowns like SE Cupp spouting her REPUBLICAN aka CORPORACISM bs on your channel and I will view you as Fox Jr and NEVER watch your channel again.I GET SO DAMN TIRED OF REPUKES TELLING US DEMS WHAT TO DO AND HOW WE WENT WRONG.   CHECK OUT YOUR OWN DAMN PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1What in the Hell am I watching.  Can&#39;t even pay attention to the news story, your breast caught my eyes and won&#39;t let me see the rest off the screen.  Their appropriate and you&#39;re pretty woman, but not the right outfit for political news station oh, you had to assume people be drawn in by your tire unless I was your plan to draw people inWho&#39;s getting the 750.00 a day per asylum seeker?I would fuck S E Cupp she looks like a pornstarShe is so wrong, how does she have a job?The orange man-baby. America&#39;s ugly buffoon.I subscribed to CNN so i could be entertained by fake news. Wtf is this?FOR CRYING OUT LOUD WILL SOMEONE BRING BACK THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND LET THE EXTREMISTS ON EITHER SIDE , AND SOME SANITY, COMPROMISE, COMMUNITY, AND HUMANITY WITH A CONSERVATIVE FISCAL CAPITALIST POLICIES WHERE WE TAKE CARE OF OUR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WILE USING WHAT WE HAVE FIRST AND TAKE ONLY WHAT WE NEED?The Dems just don&#39;t understand how elections work and what motivates the public. They&#39;re going to out-Left each other in an attempt to appease the driven primary voters, and hamstring themselves in the general. Democrats should win every election, but they don&#39;t understand marketing on any level. Their lack of understanding is pathetic.Who unliked, i just did it for the cause.Lol its no joke, fox oh sry cnn rly is a gossip Chanel now just as TyT.. Well I guess abc oh sry fox damn it i mean cnn is failing hard and regular ppl doing reporting are out playing this feeling chanelI demand that Congress give up their private insurance and accept Medicare as well if they believe in it so much.The people need more than two parties. This is now getting into la la land again.All a bunch of idiots....Trump 2020!!!!  USA will never be a socialist country....Correct.  You ARE wrong.  And on the wrong network.  Farms are going on the auction block in record numbers, going to  international conglomerates; the one job, financially secure family is now a myth,  and two jobs rarely sufficient; education has been gutted or priced out of reach; infrastructure now third-world moribund, and the chasm between the few megabucks families and the actual producers in this country grown to Cotahuasi Canyon depth.Had to keep checking that I wasn&#39;t listening to FOX by mistake.Get the women that keep shouting at people to move to shut up!The free for all strategy will crash and burn. That whole debate was about Trump and Free everything. I didn‚Äôt think the Dems could screw it up anymore than they had already. Boy was I wrong.TRUMP IS THE PUTIN PUPPET LOCK HIM UPThe &quot;You Have To&quot;<br />Mentality is just as bad as their &quot;Forced Bussing&quot; Mentality. Yet they&#39;re arguing about it.Looks like CNN has a truth segment , wow what a change !Love Van Jones and anything he&#39;s on.I think it&#39;s funny that left wing people who watch CNN are so desperate to hear precisely what they want to hear that they absolutely cannot deal with dissenting opinion, whole simultaneously making fun of Fox News watchers for doing the same.  Cupp is staunchly anti Trump, and if you watch enough commentary from her, she sits almost dead center, even leaning left on some issues.  Is she entirely right here?  Not exactly.  But where she may be wrong about the popularity of Medicare for all, she&#39;s not wrong about the ignoring of left voters Trump flipped in 2016.  Nor is she wrong about many proposals that are very unpopular nationally and across the Democratic electorate as a whole.  Even 1 in 3 African Americans are opposed to Reparations, for instance and nationally it&#39;s 68% unpopular.  Yet it&#39;s become an obsession in a quest for the most covered sound bites.<br /><br />I think she raises some points that Democrats need to address before the main event, most importantly that they are going to need way more than just progressive voters to beat Donald Trump.  And they had better make some adjustments to the platform to ensure that.Your strategy is the dumbest I‚Äôve ever seen. Loosing almost 50% of their viewers within 3 years is just outstanding! Keep doing what you have to do CNN. ü§£Sexy SECupp! Trump 2020! It&#39;s going to be too easy unfortunately lmfaooooYour mouth is very big. My cock is also very big. My cock fits in your mouth.

Super sexyWhy she wants the D to offer the R&#39;s policies? just vote R or ask R to present a decent candidate... The party is taking what their bases are asking. If you don&#39;t like it, just vote other options.Note how the people on either end of the stage frame the rest so well.We are right now in the middle of a delema,  the left has done nothing but whine yet they have done nothing but push lies about everything.<br />If you want a great country you will never get it under the demacraps socialists party. You won&#39;t get it under the demacraps party.<br />Kamala Harris Burnie Sanders and the rest of them are weak minds.<br />Push lies instead of telling you that they will work for you and the truth is they are just pocketing tons of money and nothing changes just get worse year after year.<br />You lost the election and president Trump won. So get over it, move on because president Trump will win in 2020 hands down.  Just facts nothing less.<br />Your 70 percent is fake by far. It&#39;s not even 50/50  the demacraps socialists party idealism is way down in the precentage range.Corporate CNN sounding like right wing media again.More thumbs down than up. Is this Faux News I am watching?As a straight guy, I cannot remember a time in my life that I thought ‚Äúwhat the fuck is she wearing?‚Äù<b>Let&#39;s talk about Kamaltoe Harris lying about segregation.</b><br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/6lufxM4hlYE">https://youtu.be/6lufxM4hlYE</a>No way, this in not CNN :OFunny how when cnn makes sense the comment section says it&#39;s fox news üòÜWell, if that&#39;s what they&#39;re implying, they wouldn&#39;t be wrong. Sorry, but that&#39;s why you have Trump. People can blame it on Russia all they want, but the fools still fell for Russia&#39;s scheme, and the vote was a pretty damn close call, Electoral College be damned. Most people are idiots, or ignorant at best, and are easily swayed by the fringes on both the left and the right, unfortunately - hence why Dem&#39;s and Repub&#39;s are focused on policies that appeal to the hard right and left. Now bring on the hate - I&#39;m sure that&#39;s easier than investigating the issue for yourselves.S E Cupp got some cupsI don&#39;t agree  with S.E. Cupp&#39;s strawman in this video is stupid as fuck. Unfortunately many lay people will fall for her sham argument.Van Jones....lol.<b>S. E. CUPP TOOK THE RED PILL</b>OMG, Dear black brothers, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. You don‚Äôt have to vote Democratic.Wake up - she‚Äôs right! Dems need to figure out their platform in the next 6 months that doesn‚Äôt reflect extreme shifts! They have to prove their claims on programs, not just pull them out of their asses! People don‚Äôt read websites about platforms - attention spans are too low because people have/give little time. <br />Suck it up and listen to the feedback - it will win an election!It doesn&#39;t work that way CNN. You stick to your message because you believe in them.holy f ck trump defending Biden shiiiiiietWhy are dems pushing so anti American policies? It&#39;s insane.   Open borders? Full term abortions? Health care and welfare for illegal immigrants?   INSANEMore bullshit from CNN why listen.SE SCHLUPP - Didn&#39;t this flack work for Fox ??You can tell she&#39;s a stuck up feministthe average Canadian family spent 43% of its income on taxes in 2017. Kamala would let in the 10,000 asylum seekers at $20,000 a year welfare which equals $200,000,000 a year. Very generous of you if you vote for her. Bernie would bump your taxes so high that even if your student loan was paid off, so what, you‚Äôll only have a crap standard of living anyway. If you don‚Äôt want Trump we‚Äôll take him.These news companies should stop telling you their opinions. No one fucking cares.Moderates?  Independents?  She&#39;s hallucinatingThis lady looks constipated... smug lookI don&#39;t get it, if we have medicare for all how will that destroy private  insurance? Medicare for all will give everyone basic healthcare but if you want more than that private insurance will cover what medicare for all will not, like a private room, or home care and so on. Also they say that you won&#39;t be able to see the same doctor you have been seeing, what if we get medicare for all do these doctors just disappear no they will just get paid by medicare. This is just a scare tactic to scare people and it will work, and facts what matter. For example most people was able to keep their doctor under Obamacare but if you listen to right wingers you wouldn&#39;t know this. The same for medicare for all because in rural America there are normally only one or two doctors that you can see and that will not change if we get medicare for all.Yeah chicks with big tits and tops with glasses just isn&#39;t selling fake news.<br />Thumbs up 1.1k<br />Thumbs down 1.7kWe don&#39;t care what you think Drump....I&#39;d vote for a dead cat if I thought it would get you out of office and on your way to prison.....<br />P.s.  no....I don&#39;t give a fuck about at all about those GODDAMNED drumptard faggots.....I&#39;m waiting to see if these cock sucking bastards go &quot;civil war&quot; so I can watch the cops shoot them down like the scum they are.....I do not want to pay a dime for illegal immigrants I want them deported. If you come here legally AND NEED assistance, not a problem. Build a big strong wall with lots of doors to process legal immigration applicants. Deport those who are here illegally to make room for those who have been waiting sometimes for years to enter legallyIf you&#39;re going to misstate Democrat positions, then you will never widen your listener base.<br />I happened upon this by accident &amp; am NOT impressed at all...<br /><br />Also....most americans are in favour of Free Healthcare for all !Wow wasn‚Äôt expecting that kind of sanity from CNNYou realize you&#39;re here for the quasi-Fox viewer who want to watch a middle-aged woman put on weight in her face and boobs, right?Reporters and politicians always say Trump is wrong,that not the way you do that,but you know what President Trump is doing a better job than any President in 30 year,so give your vote in 2020 or live under democrat tyranny and give free healthcare to illegal immigrants while millions of Americans are homeless and struggle to make ends meet!All the salt in the comments is gold, when you listen to what you want to hear then of course your bubble will burst. <br />If you think Dems did a good job in that debate you are either lying or in denial, you choose.The candidates should have arrived onstage in a clown car.So, what SE is saying, the whole time she and the nevertrumpers are out there telling us, as republicans, we shouldn‚Äôt support Trump. It‚Äôs all been a shitty strategy? ü§î&quot;If you think the economy is doing great, you&#39;re wrong&quot; - <b>Yes, you are wrong, Miss Corporate Democrat!</b> <br />If you&#39;d look what&#39;s going on in your country (dropping wages, automation threating jobs, increasing wealth gap since the 1990s, etc.) and wouldn&#39;t be scared of the &quot;socialist boogeyman&quot;, maybe you&#39;d see reality for what it is!SHUT up stupid idiot. <br /><br />Fuck you bitch<b>TRUMP WON BOTH DEBATES</b>FAKE news capital of the world THAT&#39;S CNN they hate good NEWS they love wars AND BAD newsGet new glasses lady. U can see the prompt screen in the reflection. Looks like a E cupp to me. üëçüèªI can&#39;t believe my eyes, a honest news report on CNN, who is this woman and how long until she is let go?!? I&#39;m literally shocked! Trump 2020!!SE Cupp, you are speaking to an audience that can not handle any truth. They want to be lied to. Truth is poison to them and they will tear you apart for speaking truth. <br /><br />But maybe, just maybe, it will open your eyes to the vulgarity and &quot;deplorable&quot; state of your audience, if CNN does not send you packing first!girl... Shut the fuck up foreverTrump wants his Joe back ... that should tell you something.Thank you!!!!Working two to three jobs, to get by, is not good employment.Want to know where you&#39;re headed, America? Check out who your presidunce&#39;s friends are. Murderer Putin. Murderer Kim Jog Un. Murderer Prince of the Saudis. Check out how those friends&#39; nations stack up under the banner of liberty, because that is where you will going, too.. Kiss liberty good bye. No more free speech, freedom of the press or the right to gather and think. And, probably the hottest item of all these days, no more guns. The coward in chief is telling us over and over how he plans to treat you after 2020. Clue in, please. The rest of us can see it, and we are wondering if you do, too.What the hell? Andrew Yang is doing exactly what you said! He‚Äôs reaching out to fringe voters and displeased Trump supporters by giving them $1000 per month, which is the cure for all!LANDSLIDE VICTORY TRUMP 2020!  and CNN LOSERS will be History!Jones, you&#39;re an Idiot. Trump will swallow all of the Dems up. fancy having Trump declared the Winner on both nights. Purely because there was not one common sense Candidate with any Policy for the good of the Average American,Woooooow cnn anchor making sense!!! ShockerIs this CNN?Their all idiots is what they have in common!!!No offence SE, but you need to get cancer..... soon!This is certainly one of the dumbest strategies I&#39;ve seen alright.... Whoever&#39;s strategy and decision it was putting this lady on to talk the shit she is spewing. With dislikes higher than likes...  Go to Fox News with this garbage.sure the dislikes thumbs down are for CNN... because she was wright on how she saw the clowns hitting each other with free stuff...Boy, is Cupp spot on!  What a far left radical group that was on display.  Trump has nothing to worry about.I can give to Trump¬† he&#39;s¬†¬†a slick snakeThis list is cnn and the democrats agenda , they follow it line for line .<br /> Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.¬†<br /><br />16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.¬†<br /><br />17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers&#39; associations. Put the party line in textbooks.¬†<br /><br />18. Gain control of all student newspapers.¬†<br /><br />19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.¬†<br /><br />20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.¬†<br /><br />21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.¬†<br /><br />22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to &quot;eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.&quot;¬†<br /><br />23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. &quot;Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.&quot;¬†<br /><br />24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them &quot;censorship&quot; and a violation of free speech and free press.¬†<br /><br />25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.¬†<br /><br />26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as &quot;normal, natural, healthy.&quot;¬†<br /><br />27. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a &quot;religious crutch.&quot;¬†<br /><br />28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;¬†<br /><br />29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.¬†<br /><br />30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the &quot;common man.&quot;¬†<br /><br />31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the &quot;big picture.&quot; Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.¬†<br /><br />32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture--education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.¬†<br /><br />37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.¬†<br /><br />38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand [or treat].¬†<br /><br />39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.¬†<br /><br />40. Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.¬†<br /><br />41. Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.¬†<br /><br />42. Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use [&quot;]united force[&quot;] to solve economic, political or social problems.¬†<br /><br />Its the communist manifesto .Ya, know; I had the same impression of the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù also. But you said it better than I could‚Äôve. I think the debates were poorly designed. The formula of letting moderators ask the candidates simplistic questions on complex subjects and impose a 10 second reply is nuts. Also to demand a show of hands indicating yes or no without a maybe in between is useless if the goal is to enlighten voters.... but I don‚Äôt think that was the goal. I think NBC‚Äôs goal was ratings, and the DNC‚Äôs goal was elimination of the field of candidates to a more manageable three or four.Fuck reaching out to Trump voters, they are lost.Fuck off ladyTake her off she is a hinder not help thumbs down to Ms. NobodyWhy spin? Every President is in bed with dictators. It&#39;s not only trump thing.I&#39;d give SE Cupp this &quot;D&quot;.This guy is an socialist idiotS.E.Cupp is right... they are wrong. GTFOwow cnn, this is pathetic.....People in these comments are still living in the elitist liberal bubble that got Trump elected the first time.  You idiots need to listen to reason or prepare to mourn in protest after Trump wins again next November.this is the news?HeheWhere in the U.S. Constitution does it mention Democracy?I really do not like SE Cupp D.....Dam ! Your ratings might go up !    Sack  this woman üë© loleveryone knows that democrats are liar and cnn as well fake news one day this broadcaster will be closed because of poorest ratings.Right wing narrow minds cannot understand what Medicare for all means. Also it is easy to forget that Nixon cheated in 72 that is why he won so decisively. The concensus is that the cover up was what worse but that is only true in the sense that it exposed the extent of how much he wanted to hide the crime of perverting justice and democracy. That was the ultimate reason he was going to be impeached.Democrats want to let illegals in and give them free healthcare<br />Vote Republican üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏When CNN tells you that you&#39;ve gone too far to the left you might want to fucking listen. LolSE Cupp is a just like Meghan McCain, 2 peas in a pod, best friends, and don&#39;t know their faces from their asses. Never know where they stand on any issue as they continue to contradict themselves. And, why is SE Cupp on CNN, I wonder! She should be right there with those lying, disgraceful FOX people.Who really gives a Fuck what rapist Trump says or does or did or will say today! He is age  retarded.<br /><br /> Fuck trumpYou people forget. Americans want anything that us free!FOX mole on CNN??? is this really CNN? WTF! hahahahaI love SE Cupp.Until &quot;white lash&quot; come on CCN.was doing alright for a few minutes..Democrats could try to elect an actual alien from Mars.  They could try to force legislation for transgender abortion rights.  They could raise our taxes to 40% across the board.  Neither would be as bad as Trump. <br />    Trump is literally a traitor that&#39;s actively doing his best to subvert the constitution through the most divisive acts of any modern president. <br />    The Democrats will push through the weeds of all their candidates that range from the far left to the moderate and corporate Democrats to present a good president. Meanwhile, the Republicans will have Trump facing indictments.Is this woman applying for a Fox News job?  Health Insurance is a scam, it adds 20% to health care costs, Medicare only adds 3%. What percentage of Trumps people don‚Äôt have healthcare? Going to the hospital and not paying the bill as many poor people do is not a resolution.Hey S.E.  a) Get a fuckin name you pretentious hack b) Maybe check out you like/dislike ratio and see how much the &quot;majority&quot; agrees with your dishonest nonsenseI only needed one video to never watch you again. Peace ooouut.This biased bullshit is why CNN is a joke in the news game.CNN just got owned by cupp and she works for them! LOLWow!!! SE Cupp is right for once. CNN is actually  reporting news that reflect the thoughts of the majority people who watched the ridiculous Democratic debates. None of their so called ideas are realistic and they all know it. Kamala Harris is already backtracking on healthcare illegal immigrants. These are  politicians doing what politicians  do, pandering to the penguin clappers who scream the loudest.<br />It is very hard to admit that so many people I&#39;ve spoken to, who always voted Democrat, now say they will  voting for Trump in 2020.<br />Trump will win the next the election by a landslide because he has every Democrat on record saying this nonsense and more. He will use this and take down any Democratic nominee he faces.Liberals should spare me crocodile tears about people art he border when they willingly kill human beings with abortion.The Npcs are out in full forceWhat she does not get because she is well off is, that a Back to &quot;Normal&quot; is not possible anymore, you need progressive ideas to make the lives of people better that are not highly paid news anchors.She is right. The candidates all repeated the same thing over and over again without bringing in anything new.<br />If they want to have a chance against trump, they need to drop the political filter and go ALL IN. Enough with the wishy washy fancy words filled speechs...<br />Also, i see a pattern here with the democrats. They all want to play on the voters emotions.  &#39;i was a black kid who was bussed in california... waa&#39; while her dad was a stanford professor and she did her high school in montreal. &#39;My dad was a janitor and my mom worked at sears...&#39; while she&#39;s getting paid 400k+ to teach few lessons in harvard... Give me a break and try other strategies if you want trump out of the white house.I&#39;m pretty sure the &quot;radical left&quot;, which is also the political global average in free countries, are actually the majority of Americans outside of the Washington bubble. There is a reason cable news is rapidly going extinctSe Cupp get a boob job done .What do you not understand SE? We don&#39;t want to meet in the middle. We want the government to stay out of our reproductive decisions. We want the government to put money towards saving our planet and on top of that, save our future children from YEARS of insane college debt. We have spent, as tax payers, more on deportations &amp; detention facilities then ever before and that money could go to helping people who are suffering from poverty, it could go towards fixing Flints water problem and thousands of other more important things that are actually beneficial to everyone here in the USA. You shouldn&#39;t be on CNN. You are stoking fear. Go Away!The dumbest people are only found in CNN and Democratic party because of the notion they have that they think they know everything in this world and only their opinions matter. Geniuses in the world are found in neither of the two institutions ( CNN &amp; Democratic Party) and its a fact.after listening to her advocate for greedy people all i can say is FUCK OFFCNN PICKS THE DEMOCRATS  NEXT PRESIDENT ..HARRISWhat fucking debate was he watching, Biden bleeding from eyes, ears &amp; mouth...PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE HISTORY BY MEETING KIM JON UN AT THE DMZ.  FAKE PROPAGANDA ORGANIZATION CNN IS GOING CRAZY. <br />TRUMP 2020The left, eating their own once again.Have no idea what she will will be saying ( she&#39;s a one the the clueless inhabitants of the media bubble, so if I happen to be on auto play , I skip to next) <br />But I&#39;ll take a guess. Either Bernie and/or Warren hate, Hail Marys to Biden or a anther audition for FOX newsThis is CNN not VOX. Moderate point of views are accepted.Wow WTF just happened on CNN?How did CNN allow this .Did a representative of Republican ideals just actually say you can&#39;t put forth nonsensical ideas that just appealed to a small sliver of the population and win an election?<br /> The ironic hypocrisy is crushing<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23whoopsiedazedandconfused">#whoopsiedazedandconfused</a>I am a far left,,,,but,,,, far left&#39;s are not gonna beat the Trump.

Good job SESE CUPP YOU LOOK GREAT IN THAT WHITE FASHION IN NEWS ROOM  .  I GOT OFF LOOKING AT YOU  AND WHITE FASHION SHOW . NOW GIVE ME TOP NEWS CUPP! TODAYFor profit healthcare is immoralSE¬†¬†¬† Say what you will about the Democrats, they are NOT Donald Trump.Send conservative nerd girl back to Fox. She comes off as lots mote smarter when surrounded by magabrains.What an uppity Selfish Bitch.<br />ü§¨üò§<br />Is she living in the real world.<br />And WTF is wrong with Van Jones ?<br />Comparing Medicare for all to transportations. Stupid analogy.Wow!  Another hot take from S.E Cupp. She&#39;s got alot of nerve, demonizing a large swath of the Dem party whilst insinuating that republicans will vote for an actual fascist regime again in 2020 if they don&#39;t get what they want. Listen hun, if you or any of your friends would vote for Trump AGAIN just because you&#39;re not getting everything your entitled asses want, then good riddance. We do not want nor need people who are despicable enough to vote for a man who is void of any morality. You&#39;ve all seen what that sick, vacuous, man has done to the country in the past 3 years and if you want to vote for him out of pure spite than thats on your conscience, not ours. Just don&#39;t come back to us acting like you have any sense of the moral high ground the next time he does something inconceivably cruel to the ones you love.Not a big fan of Van Jones and even less of C.N.N.,  found this to be a very good discussion.  S.E. made some valid points as did Van.  As I read the comments below,  some of you would make for very fine useful idiots.Lazy concern trolling, go back to Fox NewsWhy are so many republicans on tv telling democratic voters we‚Äôre aren‚Äôt republican enough. We aren‚Äôt talking about trump enough. No thanks.Wow, I thought this was FOX News! I wonder why they are so against Medicare 4 All? It couldn&#39;t possibly be that every other commercial is from a pharma company or insurance providers...Everyone go subscribe to Fox News, cnn blowsNone of these democrats want to win anything . They are far left speaking because the far left has billions to give them . It‚Äôs about $ and it‚Äôs always been about $. None of them have a snowball chance but they all have buckets at their rallies to collect the cash !!! TruthHey CNN, I&#39;ve got a scoop for you. I am a refugee who was in a park 10 years ago and a flying saucer landed. I was dragged inside by aliens and stripped naked. The Donald Trump appeared and gave me a probe. Then I was kicked out of the ufo and left there shocked and ashamed!<br />Please interview me- I will tell all! I&#39;d like Micheal Avenatti to represent me (if he&#39;s not in prison).If this is the dumbest strategy she&#39;s ever seen, then clearly she hasn&#39;t been paying attention unless he believes throwing children in cages is a smarter strategy, as must be grabbing women by the pussy, sucking up to Putin, bankrupting US farmers over tariffs... the list goes on.  Clearly the dumbest strategy of all time is CNN not giving this melodramatic drama queen the pink slip she so richly deserves.Do you want war instead.....sometimes it takes a dom person to fix <a href="http://shit.no/">shit.no</a> fan of trump but he is doing this the right way.A different way..And Van Jones - providing emergency care is not the same thing as providing healthcare, because a lot of the cost of healthcare actually goes on chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. and those are not the things you take care of in emergency rooms.Why does Trump go overseas and rag about politics in the USA, they don&#39;t care about who said what about who in USA, it&#39;s not their business.Cupp you‚Äôre an ass!Oh so much strawmaning there, SE Cupp. Warren and Harris and de Blasio are perfectly right - low unemployment doesn&#39;t make good economy for the ordinary working class because wages haven&#39;t gone up, they are still in debt up to their necks, jobs are precarious and not stable, and workers&#39; rights are like 18th century Great Britain so it&#39;s not like people can possibly even affect their work environment in any significant way. The economy is good for those that are rich, for others it&#39;s perhaps better but still not acceptable. And the people can recognize this. They are not stupid, no matter who they vote for. This is why Warren and Sanders have proposals that have huge support among Republicans as well as Democrats.The vast majority of the comments posted here are demonstrative of why this country is so screwed up.Every last Democrat supporter can suck my dick f*** you and your mama yo mama&#39;s like a f*<b>***</b> doorknob everybody gets a turnFake news need to replace this dick face right wing douchbag now. Can&#39;t afford Megyn Kelly huh?Medicare for all +healthcare for illegal immigrants +legalize border crossing =TRUMP 2020dumb lady need larger shirt saying nothingDems have gone full-blown insane...This is one of the dumbest videos I&#39;ve ever seen...Please get her off my channel!  If I wanted to hear bullshit I&#39;d watch Fox!Said this was a ‚Äúwhitewash‚Äù Van Jones lol dems are now running as biggest joke lol the irony of it allAndrew Yang is reaching Trump people but they didn‚Äôt let him speak and turned off his mic.Lol finally someone is saying the truth . The slogan of the dems is ¬´¬† i know better than u ¬´¬† qnd if u dont agree with me ¬´¬† ur a bad person who doesn‚Äôt have the right to have a voice ¬´Shut up bitch!  You&#39;re wrong!CNN = Faux NewsMeghan&#39;s bff. . now i know why. .But we are wrong!.we were wrong to elect Trump as president because he lied to the people. Do you not understand we‚Äôre desperate for actual change and not just the games you play in politics CNN? <br />That‚Äôs why Trump got elected and it‚Äôs why BERNIE WILL WIN! because he‚Äôs not playing! He is fighting for the people and we will fight too! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernie2020">#Bernie2020</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotMeUs">#NotMeUs</a>CNN .. who promised to accept election results?who are the haters.? Unreal CNN you are burning your Station to ashes lost all credibility.I stopped watching after 7 minutes Van Jones seemed honest when he said how trump is extreme and the policies reflect peoples wants but then endorsed goofball Pete Butttag so he&#39;s suspect.Your vote don&#39;t count.Sold out corporate puppet...the majority of people are struggling...while the economy works for the top wealthy..so stop lying.<br /> If u go back to ignoring that..trump will winAwesome intro Ms Cupp, CNN viewers will not like it though. This new socialist democratic party is not for the current US. If you have the strong economy with job opportunities all over the show how do you wake up and say people deserve free stuff when you can rather work on policies that focus on affordability. Theres is a lot that these candidates can improve on from Trumps initiatives but they are so blinded by hate for the man that they will opt to propose policies that will eventually kill the US. They are going to lose badly in 2020Another Republican giving DEMS advice...S.E. .....are you vying for a Fox News Job ?.... Immigrants here illegally ALREADY get free health care ! At the Emergency Room ! At 3 times the Cost. So giving them Medicare for All is Fiscally Conservative and Responsible. Private Health Care... whether you Like It or Not...Costs EVERY American MORE, almost Double what Any other Nation pays for the Same services....How is THAT CONSERVATIVE !?....<br />    My Question is WHY Any person in America WANTS to Pay More for Less  !?... Van Jones easily debunks your arguments in Real Time....and you just blew it off !?..... &quot; Gonna be hard to defend in the General&quot;....<br />    Defend What....Your Lies and Spin ?!SE Cupp just went full stupid. So the candidate you&#39;re pining for is Hilary Clinton who failed miserably. But let&#39;s carry on with the strategy of 2016 against a populist? How stupid are you?I turned off CNN when the white women commentator turned into a racist pussy grabbing republican.For a second I thought I&#39;m watching Fox.Andrew yang <a href="http://www.yang2020.com/">www.yang2020.com</a>Why does SE Cupp sound like she running in the Democratic primaries?SE is critical of democrats. Thats fine.YES CNN WE DO THINK THAT PROGRESSIVE ARE THE WAY FORWARD AND YOUR LITTLE CHARADE OF TRYING TO ACT NEUTRAL IS MORE THAN OVER,YOUR BOUGHT JUST LIKE FOX,CBS,ABC,MSNBC TO HAVE A PAID OPINION WHICH SUITS YOUR BENEFACTORS AND BOSSES HIGHER <a href="http://up.at/">UP.AT</a> THIS RATE YOU&#39;LL REALLY BE CENTRALIST NEWS NETWORK/CRIMINAL NEWS NETWORK.Clearly SE Cupp is one of the dumbest propagandist.Trump‚Äôs truly is the biggest DUMBASS of all time üòÇüòÇWho is this idiot?Hey Cupp, so you&#39;re going to vote for trump because the dems on the stage are going &quot;Far Left&quot;?<br />Far Left is revolution that often leads to dictatorship.   In contrast Far Right is authoritarian fascism that inevitably leads to dictatorship.  Your use of the adjective &quot;Far&quot; in relation to Democratic policy is BS.<br />  <br />Progressive policies are what these people were relating to.  Progressive policies and legislation are becoming attractive again to candidates in opposition to the far right movement that has taken hold of the republican party since Goldwater and genuine conservatives got their asses handed to them in the sixties and Reagan turned this country&#39;s head around in the eighties.<br /><br />Don&#39;t conflate progressive policies with revolution.  These folks are not invoking FDR and all of the presidents that followed till Nixon shit the bed but they might as well be.  And FDR and the New Deal was about as mainstream American as it gets.See,  I do  watch your cnn reporting! But you are terrible reporters, lying &amp; idiotic totally bias with an agenda.  Your hatred is vile &amp; obvious!FOR GODS SAKE&gt;&gt;&gt; CNN better FIRE this woman...........cnn is pure bullshit but Cupp is hot.<br />  Fox should hire her for their hottie stable.FOX NEWS AF.Its not a binary choice, in Canada we have universal healthcare and private healthcare limited and regulated, lolol comeon its not rocket science. Weve had healthcare for 60+ years and were not as rich as you!I do not understand: this video implies that the republicans are the party providing¬†the shortcomings in she is pointing out in the democratic candidates. The case is being made that for those people in search of the things Cupp pointed out to be lacking with the democrats can be found with the republicans. That is a lie!you idiots have lost it.Republicans dont vote in the Democratic Primaries, therefore WHY APPEAL TO THE RIGHT?

Anyways her and smerconish should work for foxFuck you CNN, we DO WANT MEDICARE FOR ALL!!!These cannibals in Democrat party have set their eyes on Creepy JoeWho the hell gave you a mic?I am so used to seeing SE sort of confirm  already what I was thinking even though she is a republican, I feel weirded out by disagreeing with her just now... idk she knows betterCupp is a trumptard in disguise as a dumb bitch...Well said. Democrats aren‚Äôt  appealling to anyone in the middle. Weird..Cupp has huge tits.So instead of having to use the same subway system you&#39;d rather have a system where people who have money can get a special pass that would allow them to throw you off of the subway so they can get on it?Wow is she scared of having to kick down a few more dollars in tax&#39;s Sorry ms fox wanna be 70% of the country swings leftFirst smart discussion from cnn for a while now, never thot they&#39;ll come back from fake news.The 71% ARE wrong that the economy is doing well because their standards of measurements are so damn low.better put your filter back on bitch you sound like a republicunt !I try to watch this person and I just cant. she is wrong and just spent 10 minunets calling us idiots saying we should not call others idiots. stupid person who was  and is wrong.Well get ready for 4 more years of trump. She looks to have a size E cupp, nice üëçSE Cupp should be on Fox News this bitch makes millions a year and obvious a Republican. I&#39;ll bet she voted for Trump making her a Trumppanzee.All you need is a magic wand to win the general. Nuff said.SE cupp is a retarded white womenDems are generally dumb and stupid. Nuff said.Uh oh.  After losing viewership in droves after reporting the Russian collusion hoax as historical fact for two years, has CNN decided that fake news may no longer be a profitable business model?  We shall see.Erm it&#39;s why you have a constitutional Republic you moron. The representatives are elected based on education and experience ability to run the country üôÑ Every business channel says the country is in for a huge recession like Bush in 2020.SC Cupp, you are WRONG! No wonder your thumbs down is higher than your thumbs up, which just says to me, you are OUT OF TOUCH WITH YOUR OWN AUDIENCE! So are they wrong or are YOU?This is the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. Nobody is proposing That everyone will be forced to use Medicare‚Ä¶ Not even Bernie. Medicare for all has always meant ‚ÄúMedicare for all who want it‚Äù it is just ridiculous that after two nights of debate where these people finally Decide to talk about popular ideas CNN immediately goes nuts ‚ÄúHow come nobody‚Äôs pandering to the right?‚Äù! Trump supporters are not going to shift, So the only way to win is to get people you didn‚Äôt vote To be energized and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trump‚Äù It‚Äôs not the message to run onWhy so many dislikes here. She brings facts to help Democrats and will anyone listen?I&#39;m afraid this woman has mental disorder. Either that or she really is just an ignorant loser.Sorry fruity liberals the truth hurts.Another KarenNo one should forget that SE Cupp came from privilege and net worth is now $6 million dollars. She is a true Republican and doesn&#39;t want to see any programs that will support the average American. She is trump&#39;s secret propaganda machine.Dems will pick Their candidate. CNN pick Trump. Kind of surprising, but there we are! Politics can&#39;t all be about cynically tell people what we think they wanna hear- it has to be about wanting a change, having new bald ideas. You can&#39;t go out there and claim &quot;I wanna be a &#39;Trump light&#39;,  only more civil!&quot;  Because if you have no ideas for change, you&#39;ve no reason to be a candidate at all!Sanders 2020. Even the uneducated Trump devotees need Health Care and Education, and urgently. We don&#39;t have 4 years to waste. C&#39;mon guys, we know you have trouble reading more than 4 letters. You can&#39;t compete with State educated Chinese workers, and you certainly can not compete with self-driving trucks. Wake up!Cnn is secretely a fascist organisationWiping out student loan debt would be great for the economy..I love that endless war and tax subsidies for Corporations is perfectly fine but how dare we help out regular peopleSE cupp is running for a spot on fox news. This is not the first time I have heard her make stupid generalisations. She is not as smart as she thinks she is.I&#39;m disappointed in this reporting....is she trying for a job in the White House.Because it&#39;s the DEMOCRATIC primary you boring people.  Smerconish, Joe S, you all seem to have forgotten this is about the party&#39;s nomination first and then the debate with America following that.  Quite simple really...Alternatively, they could pull a trump and flat out lie to everyone that you&#39;re going to work for them when you really mean that you&#39;re going to screw everyone whilst enriching your crime family and the super wealthy.<br />Be cautious SE Cupp, you might become trumps &quot;type&quot; just make sure you were a cup, if you meet him in person, you know how he likes to grab things LolWhy is there a CNN symbol on fox news?So we are to dothat code things for the low IQ trump supporters? Nah, if you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re fucking wrong.Why do we care what the derp has to say?Biden has already bought the nomination, so why have 24 candidates anyway?Shut the fuck up you out of touch bitch!! That&#39;s not what the majority of the Dem Party wants!!!! We want healthcare...free college....better immigration policies....women&#39;s rightsRaise your hand if you&#39;re an idiot. Those were the worst debates ever filmed. No need for an election anymore. Trump has been re elected. The fact that Rachel Maddow is asking the questions is so pathetic. You think anyone can beat Trump? CNN has become a joke. None of the 24 have the slightest chance of winning.GOD FORBID THEY TALK ABOUT REAL ISSUES INSTEAD OF GIVING PEOPLE CHILDISH NICKNAMES!!! CNN NOT HELPING THINGS BY DISPARAGING THE NOMINEES? LEAVE THAT TO FUX NEWS!!! THANKS DUMBASSES FOR HELPING ORANGE PILE OF SHIT!!!üí©üí©üí©I am definitely voting Trump.. enough said..its no different from HRC calling her potential voters a basket of deplorables..SE Cupp apparently thinks they should lie to those who are wrong.Why do only feminazis ge the job at CNN?I love my private healthcare insurance SAID NO ONE EVER.How does SE Cupp have a TV show?  She is completely disconnected from where the American people are and obviously learned nothing from what happens when the Democrats nominate a centrist candidate.I COULD PUT UP WITH THIS SLUT..........IF SHE WERE MUZZLED IN A PORN FLIC.I could vote for Tulsi Gabbard...but the democrats won&#39;t put her up cause of their racial politics among other reasons.  Democrats are just as bad as the right when it comes to warmongering and Tulsi is all for troops coming home.  Healthcare is not as important as ending war and stop killing people.  War is the number one issue immigration is number two and finallly healthcare at number three. Woman care more about killing their offspring than for the lives of our military members and that is just plain sad.  If democrats want my vote they need a road map and right now they are a rudderless ship with nothing to offer AMERICANS who work and free everthing for illegals.  When they start talking to the Citizens of this country I might listen.  BTW...free doesnt exist...somebody HAS to pay...so get ready for more and higher taxes if the dems get in.Flip Flop Kamala Harris ..she already flip flopped on taking away private healthcare. She¬¥s so fake it&#39;s unbelievable that people take her seriousCondescending Much.i did not vote for Trump but i have to give it to the guy, he is getting things done. after watching the DNC debates and what Democrats have said and done since Trump has been in office, i&#39;m looking forward to another 4 years of Trump in office.üç≠Funny, sometimes poignant funny. The election result is already known, I sometimes wonder why they debate so much when result already known.üòêWhy does CNN host this thundercunt<br />SE Cunt just twists words and events to fit her &quot;fascist-lite&quot; version of Reichstag&#39;s agenda.<br />I WATCHED THE DEBATES YOU LYING CUNT!  Based just on what you&#39;ve said here in the first few minutes makes it very obvious that you did not, you twisted tea party bitch.Whatever C Cupp. You might as well just finish rounding the block and join fux news, if they&#39;d even have u.What&#39;s the fuss? Hillary will steal the nomination again.Has CNN turned into Fox News now ??? üôÑü§ÆSo the candidates have to perpetuate bullshit to make the by people who fall for it feel better?Oh look, a rich bitch who dosn&#39;t want to pay higher taxes.I&#39;m honestly surprised by her ignorance on subject of the economy. The economy and businesses are two separate things. Businesses are doing very well right now under the Trump Administration which is only pushing to increase vast difference between the middle class workers who make that money for the upper class. Those tax breaks are not passed on to the people who are making the businesses profitable. Of course it&#39;s going to look like the economy is doing well when companies are making the most they possibly can because of the tax breaks they&#39;ve gotten. How about we look at realistic things that normal people have to. How about a debt to income ratio? Because the debt to income ratio of the u.s. has fallen drastically under the Trump administration because he is giving tax cuts and we have less income because of these cuts while he is spending more and more on a relevant b*<b>****</b> while cutting the small things out of the budget such as public radio and thinking this is an accomplishment.I am from Lithuania I am coming over to your country USA  and I want $500000 if you not going to give me that money you are all bigots and racistsThese debates were poorly thought out and executed.  Some good candidates said things they&#39;ll regret if one of them gets the nomination.  I didn&#39;t watch them because I figured they would be a free-for-all and they were, but the media made it worse.  Watching the excerpts and commentary in the aftermath of the debates I have to ask the DNC, what were you thinking?  Cupp may well be right in saying Trump was the winner of the debates.  She IS right that there was little or nothing for independents, moderates, and conservatives opposed to Trump in these debates.  As a life long Democrat and liberal I have to ask, was there a strategy and, if so, what was it?Super Video ! A Very Naise Reporter !This woman is extremely opinionated, I thought I was going to see a Journalist, guess not.&quot;de-criminalizing illegal boarder crossings&quot;<br /><br /><br />So just let everybody in? So a guy from, let&#39;s say, Poland, can book a flight to Mexico and just cross the boarder?<br /><br /><br />You seriously have to wake up now it is getting worse for you leftists.Reporter SNN - A Very Sexsi ! Very Sexsualiti, Very Sexsapility !Putin. Xi Jinping. Mohammad bin Salman. Rodrigo Duterte. Kim Jung-Un. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. Recep Tayyip Erdogan. <br /><br />All murderous DICTATORS who Trump has ass kissed and praised repeatedly.It is plain and clear this person is an idiot !!!Sounds like she stuck the landing.  Dems and regressives are the dumbest and gullable people on the face of the earth.This bitch knows it the democratic primary and not the general right? Why would they all be pandering to Donald trumps mouth breathers during their PRIMARY? Did she ever show footage of the Republican primary of 2016 and say ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt these candidates trying to win over Obama supporters?!‚ÄùWhat&#39;s wrong with Medicare for all ? Why are u twisting it &quot; even for people who don&#39;t want it &quot; ? That&#39;s for people who can&#39;t afford health insurance not for the ones who can build a private hospital in their backyardsI don&#39;t want to listen to Liar King. Why give him a platform? Oh an BTW SE are you still a registered G0-P utin member?Two women and a Cupp.  And as usual. the cup is full of shit.Seems to me like they are trying to get votes PRIMARILY for Democrats because...well you know!This woman got nice boobs... creampie anyday my ladyThis was one of the most moronic monologs I listened to at CNN üò≥<br /><br />Also, did she realy said that you shouldnt stick with the truth If people may not want to hear it? <br />Wtf, guess it&#39;s saying a lot about herself... She shouldnt be on a News Network with this attitude...!wow dave Chappelle is correct we really do live in the age of spinYou fucking snowflakes in the comments..... Se cupp speaks truth.Stop moaning in the comments about what she says. If you don&#39;t listen to and learn about your enemy, your strategy to beat them will fail.I am a blond white woman so listen to meWhen all the front runners got their   ass easily kicked. And biden even cut himself offü§î you think this lady is wrong?trumps illiterate fake voiceSupport for a womans unfettered ass.  Oh myyyThis lady is fucking trash. CNN ought to be embarrassed to have her working for them.I didn&#39;t know CNN still has a normal person ü§îfNN fake news Networksomeones when I hear american politicians talk abotu universal healthcare, I wonder if any of you ahve ever, ever looked at countries who already have it.  Apparently not. The way you do it is to have a basic &#39;medicare for all&#39; coverage and if you want better than that, you buy insurance for additional services, no payment gaps etc.<br /><br /><br />how about you actually look beyond your own antiquated borders and find out how the rest of the world does it very successfully.CNN is the dumbest thing I have ever seenLMAO Jesus the donors threw money at this bitch and told her to get on camera and bash progressive ideas. They are in a panic which is Perfecto!Semantics, no one even the sophisticated informed voter goes for this shit, it needs to be simpler, the seminal reason why Trump, needs/must be removed is a question on top of everything else....regardless....? In fighting, on irrelevant topics seems to detract from a winning strategy and also just plays into Trumps agenda to disregard the Dems so easily because he know he is on a winning streak if this goes on....? The Dems who have the wish to self-destruct is legend because they cannot deal with question at hand ie to remove Trump but to morph into an argument that does the other side such huge favours negates the entire reason why?<br />The News cycle has now focussed on the Biden/Kamala debacle incessantly and nothing here to get at Trump for the second time in a row, this is sad....Kamala was wrong to attack Biden the way she did, it was self serving and no credence given in any regard to staying on message to remove Trump....?<br />This debate failed, no matter what policies they have must take a back seat to pointing out how they will change all that has gone wrong in the last two and a half years? No matter how sincere they are about their own agenda...?Everyone in the comment section she&#39;s not a socialist / communist.  She deserves better. Fox News. Not fake news.I normally like your show, but now I&#39;m thinking you&#39;d do much better in porn......Trump just walked into North Korea.Health care for illegal immigrants is something that we have here in Europe. Nothing special, we just don&#39;t let a human being die in front of a public hospital because he is not legal.I would love to see this weird bitch talk shit about the republican presidential candidates not reaching out to the left ü§£. I don&#39;t even know who this washed up DVD porn actress looking hooker is except for a retarded right winger.Maybe the people that are in favor of all of these Progressive policies are the ones they will end up being correct. I can understand the argument against abortion it&#39;s a personal decision which you should not be forcing on everybody else in the world. No one is having abortions at crazy times in the pregnancy process that&#39;s all fake fake fake. Se you really missed everything this timeWhy haven&#39;t you covered Trump&#39;s trip to North Korea..??? Oh ya that&#39;s positive news!!!WTF is this shit , I kept expecting ashton kutcher to jump out and scream  punked !Hey yall forgot the &quot;fake&quot; in your hash tag its supposed to say <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fakenews">#fakenews</a>. Looks like y&#39;all of all people would know that by now lolfirst time i liked a CNN video in a very longtimeSurprise to see the tolorent, women respecting left dehumanising this lady. ü§£ü§£ so much for misogonyCNNPCs at their finest.SE CUPP, I don&#39;t think so. .....   DE, probably double DE  CUPP at least.We got free education in Germany and it&#39;s good because then you have a better chance to get a job that pays you more than you need in a month ... it doesn&#39;t work all the time but most of it and that&#39;s important. Having everybody have health insurance is easy here: you got a job, you pay half of the tax, the employer the other half; when you&#39;re a pensioner or jobless it&#39;s the state; if you&#39;re under 18 or still under 25 but studying it&#39;s your parents ... th√© only problem is that not enough people become doctors and nurses but that&#39;s a different matter (it&#39;s stupid you need an A+ at the end of your last year in high-school in all subjects to get a chance to get to medical school which is a bit overkill)<br />So, SE, you&#39;re wrong to think that that won&#39;t appeal to moderates! It would if they just think for a moment that social cohesion is going to benefit them too &#39;cause you can lose your job, your kid might want to start paying her apartment with her salary instead of her student loan without ma,kng new debt because of it ... if you say it right, they will understand and agree and vote for it. In that case, 30 seconds on a debate stage ain&#39;t enough might actually be true unless you speak 20p words per minute!No one need your right-wing advice, duffer.This lady will improve the falling ratings,she talks common sense.<br />People have had enough of Lemon and Cuemo ,whining on about Trump every day.<br />All these die hard dems attacking CNN today, you gotta love it.Again.... More dislikes than likes. When will CNN learn?? Get on the grassroot... Talk to the working class people. Talk to the poorest. Then you will understand.Cupp is shocked that a debate amongst people seeking votes in the DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY didn&#39;t do enough to appeal to Republicans. Well, S.E. I noticed they didn&#39;t really do anything to address the concerns of those living in Malta, either.<br />I notice how those on the right always whine that the left is trying to appeal to them but never suggest anyone on the right try to appeal to the left.ALL HUMANS NEED HEALTHCARE. Americans are not the only humans. When Americans go to Europe and get hurt they get better and free healthcare, than at home. This lack of empathy for others is the beginnings of fascism.She&#39;s incorrect on this, she didn&#39;t explain what the candidates full response on those issues she mentioned was. For example, on Kamala Harris&#39; saying the unemployment and jobs numbers say the economy and employment is rigged towards the rich corporations because people are working 2-3 jobs to get by and that is unacceptable.Hang on is this CNN or Fox &amp; Fiends? Hard to tell given SECUPP&#39;s Right Wing rhetoric.<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SECUPPCNNFAIL">#SECUPPCNNFAIL</a>Holy fing F.... Lady what is wrong with you. Do you know polls?You don&#39;t need medicare for all to fix healthcare.  You need to bring the price of healthcare down by leaps and bounds so that it becomes affordable.  You need less regulation via the FDA, more pharma companies being allowed to come up with revolutionary drugs, more doctors being licensed, etc.  In other words more competition in a rather closed field.  Stop going after supplements and herbs.  Push for mandatory GMO labeling.   Insurance companies are not the problem, their premiums reflect the outrageous costs of healthcare, hence they have large deductibles, death panels, and people who can&#39;t even afford to buy plans.Ms. Cupps is indeed a conservative, but I did not hear her <b>advocating</b> a specific position, rather she asked good questions, made pointed critques, that any savvy campaign worker should be looking for stuff like this. IMHO, she was feeding a meaningful bunch of swtrategy points. Watch for more stuff on this in the July round of debates, least of which to see who&#39;s still in the race.Tucker Carlson and  SE Cupp could have a wonderful showWHOA!  THIS IS CNN??    BWHAHAHAHA!!!!<br />Do you think the DNC meddling in the election might have something to do with it??  They should all be in prison!!  Obama, Clapper, Brennan, Comey, Stroze, Page....Then let&#39;s talk about AOC, Omar, and the rest of the Commies...Really???Pfff, go to Fox News with your right-wing propaganda.she sounds like first Trump&#39;s campaign speechSo , CNN does not think it&#39;s newsworthy that Donald Trump is the first US President to step foot on North Korean soil. Obama could not do it. Clinton could not do it. Carter could not do it. JFK could not do it. Trump accomplished this . He will be considered one of the greatest Presidents. He will be re-elected.I LOVE NANCY PELOSI! SHE HAS A LUCY P LOOSE E! SHE NEEDS TO BUY SOME TIGHTEN UP N SHAWUNCE.

I wish YouTube would allow you to opt out of anything from the corporate media.Is CNN covering the protests in OKLAHOMA against jailing immigrant children?Who in their right mind would want to keep their regular insurance over M4A?<br />Americans like high deductibles, co pays and high cost prescriptions? <br />Gtfo, SEBAS!!! Trump 2020 he just sealed itYou belong on Fox News.I love how Van Jones keeps saying over and over again, &quot;they&#39;re trying to force Medicare on people who don&#39;t want it!&quot;  Who are these people?  What don&#39;t they want about Medicare?  My mother loves her Medicare, and it has saved her life twice now; while enabling her to keep her apartment and not bankrupting her.  I&#39;ve seen so many news articles about middle-aged men and women with insurance that denied them health coverage, trying to hang on until they qualify for Medicare so their life-threatening condition can be treated; and some die before they qualify.  <br />So what people exactly is Van Jones talking about who don&#39;t want a life-saving system that won&#39;t bankrupt you? :Obama advisor Van Jones ü§° Obama admitted after leaving office  that his policies were actually  conservative. Neoliberals  are the mortal enemy of the average American. We need a Progressive  takeover or the death of the  democratic  party. The republican party proudly act as douchebag but  neoliberals  lie to us and promise incremental  change  to horrible policies.Blond blue eyed and right wing. I suddenly thought this was Fox.The debates are a meaningless clown show. The Dems are in a total mess. CNN are FAKE news üòé.39% wont get you elected‚Ä¶but it would be nice to steal a chunk of his base.. But on this messy take SE Cupp sounds like an elite who lives in a bubble, high up in her penthouse/loft‚Ä¶the everyday person wants to see the change, and actually feel the benefits of the ‚Äúgreat‚Äù economy trump espouses...THINK. Trump wants Biden to win the Primary  because he is the easiest  to beat. Biden is a Zionist and a racist/bigot just like Trump.Lol!  What the hell is she talking about?  The majority of Democrats and independent voters Want healthcare reform, and the majority of Republicans on Obamacare want to keep it!  Why the hell did CNN hire Cupp?  She should have stayed on Fox where she doesn&#39;t stand out as crazy compared to the others.  Her opinions are dim and she doesn&#39;t add anything to a serious discussion.  She talks about the Democrats calling midwestern states &quot;boobs who don&#39;t know what is good for them&quot;.  The Democrats have not done that.  This is a very old scam by GOP pundits, putting words in the mouth of Democrats that they did not say.  She is also parroting the Trump campaign meme &quot;Trump won the Democratic debate&quot;.  Sean Hannity and other idiots are saying that, and how Cupp is repeating it.  <br />I&#39;m sorry, Cupp, but the only boob in the room is your, and your boobs, to be blunt, are half the reason people even look at you when you talk.   It certainly isn&#39;t your well-reasoned &quot;arguments&quot;....<br />Hiring Cupp was the dumbest strategy CNN has undertaken, and she has dumbed down their entire network....The democrats are not pushing democratic socialism, they are pushing social democracy, which is a huge welfare state and incredible taxation on a country that already has amassed $23 trillion in debt and can barely pay the interest, let alone the principle.  And 12 years to fix climate change before it becomes &quot;catastrophic&quot; is straight up UN bullshit that will cause de-industrialisation.  Yes I want weed de-criminalised, yes to fixing healthcare, yes to ending the wars and shrinking the DOD budget, yes to more taxes on the rich, etc BUT IN A REALISTIC WAY, not pie in the sky unachievable nonsense.  Bernie is a bigger lunatic than trump and trump is pretty bad himself since he wants to deport millions of immigrants/refugees seeking assylum from troubled countries, seperates families at the border and has people in cages, is pushing for regime change in multiple countries, etc.oooooooooooohhh Watching The sack of shit TRump is like watching somebody&#39;s sweaty balls hanging in front of a microphone , just hanging and just being sweaty balls , it&#39;s truly the filthiest view ever caught on videoLove her big ass tits.SE is very easy on the eyes!  I call her D Cup, she loves the way I take care of herIs this a news channel or a anti trump propaganda machine ? It‚Äôs really hard to tellTrump is such a boss!Did Mr Trump buy CNN?.Wow what a load of BS! Fuk CNN is cancer for intellect and productive conversation. Just spreading complete nonsense about what progressives want. Pathetic.Totally agree.  The Democrats are going too far to the left, it will hurt them in the general election.DJT could NEVER be expected to volunteer kind words of anyone. He only ever has praise for himself and those who might receive credit for doing a job DJT hired them for. He&#39;s too insecure and too in need of praise and attention making it impossible for him to give what he&#39;s so desperate for. Virtually every time he speaks he must tear others down in the interest of building himself up.SE Cupp seems to think that the average American voter makes in excess of $200,000 a year and doesn&#39;t give a damn about anything else, even the extinction of the human species due to climate change.Just take your ass to FOX and get a job over there!The problem is that the majority have gotten used to the systems as normal, and therefore accept them as ok. They‚Äôre all getting by, they‚Äôre all managing... for the most part. How things could really be, with changes to these fundamental systems (health care, income, infrastructure, et al) is just not believable to many, if not the majority.Such a Republican point of view! These candidates have a very limited time to get their point across to what I presume was a predominantly democrat audience. They don‚Äôt  need to do any reaching out to republicans until they are in a position to make a difference.S.E. must know this, yet she and her tribal sister Meghan keep on saying how the left is failing in their attempts to appease the right. They are trying to undermine democratic candidates at almost every opportunity. I‚Äôm sure they are secretly hoping that Trump will win a second term while they openly call him out for his disgusting behaviour and awful policies. They are red to the core.Se Cupp sometimes hammers the Truth! and the lefties can handle the Truth!!!Can someone tell me how, the American citizen, can pay for all the healthcare of the world?Trump&#39;s style of Diplomacy works, far better than Obama hypocrisyüë≥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë≥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëµI myself know lot&#39;s of people not benefiting from the striving economy.<br />Are they wrong too?<br />The economy is doing great, without doubt, but far from everyone is doing better.She is insaneOh shut up SE !!! Bernie&#39;s ideas were wildy impopulars a couple of years ago. They&#39;re meanstream now !!! <br />Nothing wrong to tell people they&#39;re wrong if you can make your case...CNN is a good example of CIA blunders. Lizard failed their attempts to take everything down.Hooray for diversity and a different point of view as<br />leaders of the Evangelical Covenant Church voted to defrock a Minneapolis pastor and expel his church for permitting gay marriage! Hip hip hooray!CNN sucks.Getting along with people is bad ? Fighting with them makes better news? Is it the world against the Democrats?The media could never be satisfied, because they are S-C-U-M bags.AND VAN JONES IS ANOTHER ONE.Came to CNN to see coverage of Trumps historic meeting with Kim, but it seems CNN don&#39;t know about it.Medicare for all is just another way to finish off Medicare for Seniors who have paid into Medicare since 1966.  You greedy &amp;#(@#%@* go get your own insurance and leave Medicare alone.Let&#39;s complain about others over simplifying by radicaly simplifyingShe is telling the Dems how they might have a chance which won&#39;t work because the party has gone so far left and looked at as socialists. Many moderate Dems will turn to Trump as they did in 16. Many more this election because the socialist stigma will drive them away.Is this CCN, or Fox?  Either way, you lost yourself sweetheart.SE Cupp: Right wingers only care about their own base and they don&#39;t reach out to the other side. Good strategy.<br />SE Cupp: Left wingers only care about their own base and they don&#39;t reach out to the other side. Bad strategy.Since when is it the Democratic Party&#39;s job to appeal to Republicans?<br />And by the way, you&#39;re quite seriously deluded if you think the majority of the country is that conservative, looking at polls on support for Medicare for All and free public tuition woud be sufficient yo prove otherwise <br />You belong to Fox at best with that level of idiocy...Also, can someone please tell these candidates that there is more going on that undocumented citizens?<br /><br /><br />They spent WAAAY more time talking about what Twitter clowns want to talk about.  Denounce Trumps deplorable treatment of people at the border and then talk about health care and the economy.Well if we all made as much money as you do we might think like that but for the other 80% of the population we need these changes wake up get your head out the sand and see the progressive movement is rolling outNobody stood up for &quot;disaffected Trump voters&quot; because, you&#39;re right, they don&#39;t count. So STFUThis a primary debate. How many disaffected Trump voters are going to vote in a dem primary? U Dumb B*tch.Why is everyone saying this is Fox news 2.0. She is just calling it as it is. The Democrats have gone insanewhy did they even show the clip of Donald&#39;s response! nobody cares what he thinksRepublicans are just pure trash.Look at their leader.S E. how very condescending of you to  give advice to democrats like you really care.Wow!  Someone shoot me!  I actually agree with Donald Trump!It&#39;s OK if Republicans turn to natzi&#39;s &amp; religious zealots to win elections, but <b>Eeek</b> how dare those Democrats lean left!!?!! üôÑ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9tGMUq4XEQ&amp;t=0m55s">0:55</a> Guess this really isn&#39;t news, but Trump doesn&#39;t know what the word &quot;portend&quot; meansVan just sounded dumb as shit medicare for everyone who doesnt want it..... Who the fuck doesnt want medical ??? He silly sillyDoes anyone want to trade me a home, car, and a life for a master peace entitled Know a {Trace~(See&#39;s~Her)~O} GOD<br />(Know a)(Trace ~See&#39;s)( Her~O)<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/riIl7h_lWv8">https://youtu.be/riIl7h_lWv8</a>Nice way to put your spin on what was a successful debate. Don&#39;t let the facts stop you S.E. Americans support progressive ideals and everyone that lives paycheck to paycheck know that the economy isn&#39;t working. Complete garbage.And this is considered a serious journalist according to CNN ? My god the amount of self-centered fame-hungry people calling themselves journalists on mainstream news channel is mind blowing.  <br /><br />What is this CNN?  The same good old propaganda pushed by the corporate body behind the news organisation.  Cupp and Van Jones using the lamest objection to the idea of free health care like they are all of sudden Trumpists or republicans, pushing a false narrative of the f**king choice of your healthcare plan and doctor?  WTF??? as if America is standing alone on Earth, as if they cannot even consider to take example on the majority of other countries who treat their citizens with respect and provide mostly free health care to them by a number of different way...<br /><br />So yeah, CNN is openly encouraging those air heads on TV by having them take themselves waayyy too seriously as if they are true intellectuals and not the kind of which seems to be the majority in the U.S. ; deeply ignorant people unable to realize they are and therefore convinced the audience cannot see through their. Deeply.  Stupid. Plan.<br /><br />Pushing a weak, ridiculous   but above all else false narrative of free health being an impossible dream of which it would be irresponsible to take seriously.<br /><br /><br />CNN is down in the gutter all right.  No amount of arm crossing, HD resolution painted faces and overly dramatic comments can save the artificial allure of that piece of junk americans  call journalism.Reading the comments... Wow!  Seriously people, get out of your bubbles.<br />She&#39;s absolutely right on many of this and it&#39;s good to have an objective opinion of a left leaning news organization.  If you don&#39;t have someone to point out when you&#39;re fucking up, you&#39;re gonna keep fucking up! Do you want Trump out of office or not? Honestly, you already have the left base vote locked in... they are simply anti Trump, it&#39;s time to start appealing to more centralist voters. Stop thinking it&#39;s all about you and your feelings. (I know it&#39;s hard, but suck it up for the greater good)I bet SE has an incredible set of boobs.BERNIE ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />Everyone else is just riding his coattails. Bernie actually means what he says and can go toe to toe with Trump!Why does this women have a showü§ØWTF is this guy on about with &quot;health care for people who don&#39;t want it&quot;?  There is NOBODY who doesn&#39;t want health care!  There are a whole lot of people who can&#39;t afford it, currently - because the only providers available are for-profit groups who would happily kill you themselves if it would make them a dime they thought they could get away with it.Where is the candidate representing believers in segregation and racism? What a dumb strategy to tell these people to tell them they are wrong and not pander to everyone&#39;a interest and promise everyone to get what they want and in the end dissapointing everyone. That way you guarantee frustrationBernie only raised his hand to ask a question-‚Äúwhere am I, how did I get here, what‚Äôs my name again‚Äù?No. Brilliant example of critical thinking. (She is fkn hot too.)&quot;Those folk don&#39;t matter&quot;<br />lol have you ever seen republicans pander to the democrats in theire primaries? Such a stupid point.SE Cupo: You are a Republican that wants to get rid of Trump. Why don&#39;t you get a primary Challenger for Trump instead of trying to find your Republican candidate in the Democratic Party?CNN keeps pushing narrative that Dem candidates are too far too the left, but the fact is, most Americans, whether Democrat or Republican, want a living wage, they&#39;re concerned about the environment, they want higher taxes on the wealthy, they want affordable health care and they want corporate donor money out of politics. SE Cupp, Smerconish and the rest are all far right to the average American, because they&#39;re owned by AT&amp;T and earn millions of dollars, so of course, they think the economy is doing fantastic. SE Cupp&#39;s net worth is six million dollars!!!Cupp o shitAll the democrats complaining about hearing a different opinion than there‚Äôs are the problem. I just realized we‚Äôre going to lose the election.After CNN constantly campaign those extreme left things, then they are disappointed that their candidates goes extreme left. It cannot defeat Trump? So CNN also lied to those lefties??? Use your brain people.. lolPeople like this fool is why I unsubscribed from CNN.(While wagging my finger)....&quot;Eat your vegetables, they&#39;re good for you whether you like the taste or not.&quot;She spoke real words though. She wasn&#39;t saying she disagree with their stances, she is just saying that they shouldn&#39;t alienate the majority.1.  SE cupp is out of touch with reality because she is blinded by establishment bias -so typical of the cable news machine<br />2.  Yes, free college is popular.  And many people would rather their tax dollars go towards college instead of the fat cats running the war industrial complex and instead of paying for tax cuts for the wealthy.<br />3.  The way to fight a populist like Trump is with a populist democrat.  If democrats put up an establishment candidate like Hilary Clinton against a populist, then that would be a horrible move.  Trumps election proves that Americans are tired of the status quo.MILF alert. They want to give all illegal immigrants free healthcare. The left going farther left, no complaints by me. Maga2020damn, am i the only one that thought it was a porn channel? lovely white top BB, bet she&#39;s wearing a thong below cameraFree free free...for everyone but US citizens. democratic socialism is no different then socialism..just put a word in front of it=same thing . But those that want it soooo bad are blind sheeps that just hate on Trump nd his supporters.Whoa. Yikes. God. Poor woman. She thinks she&#39;s a democrat. She clearly is not.Wait, Trump continuously tells democrats and all who he deems a threat they are wrong or fake news all the while lying to do so. Where is the outrage?Oh dear, she said that something in American politics is &#39;far left&#39;.I think the logo is wrong .. it is FOX NEWS ,, those who thinks things works as it is lost to a clown in 2016Van Jones has lost his mind if he thinks Dems have any chance in 2020!  Decriminalize the border? Free healthcare for illegal immigrants? Are you kidding me! We will have every man woman and child from South America coming straight for our borders!  Is CNN that disconnected?Get off your high horse.SE Cup uses the SE because she thinks it stands for &quot;Super Intelligent&quot; Yes, we know that &quot;Intelligent&quot; doesn&#39;t start with an &quot;E&quot; but she is Republican.<br />Harris did nothing in my book because all she has is the &quot;race card&quot; and if race was the issue. Her rich ass wouldn&#39;t be a Senator or wealthy. She is a backing stabbing lying b__ch. She said she would stand with fellow Senators and not attend the AIPAC meeting. Then invited AIPAC to her office at the same time. She claimed she was bumping Snoop Dog in college and Snoop hadn&#39;t dropped a track yet. Now she claims her rich ass was bused in public school segregation? Was she or is it just another lie she didn&#39;t need to tell? Tramp can go home as far as I am concerned.Dumpie and his dumpsters are happy to spread all the hate he  and his hateful minions can.Black and white. There is no subtlety for this lady. Generalisations everywhere. Wrong network for that.Republicans are literally in control of the presidency and the Senate, yet it&#39;s ALWAYS the Democrats that get criticized for not reaching across the aisle. In a week that the Democratic controlled congress 100% capitulated to Mitch McConnell in the hope that he&#39;ll use the money to stop abusing children anymore. Trump couldn&#39;t do what he is doing without McConnell&#39;s support.It doesn&#39;t bother her that we would get free healthcare, it bothers her if immigrants get healthcare period.  I&#39;ve heard that before from so called concerned Americans, yet Republicans spend all of our tax payer money on military and corporate agendas, but the fact that an injured immigrant gets medical assistant is an outrage.  Immigrants put all the money they make back into the economy. Immigrants rent, buy cars, clothes, food and yes some luxury items, and keep small businesses thriving.   Get rid of immigrants and prices will go up. deport immigrants and companies will go out of business, deport immigrants and children will lose their parents, mixed race marriages will lose a partner, and racism will be strengthened because racist white people will feel justified in confronting all immigrants. But you go SE Foxey 4.Hey S.E., your party has embraced Russia as a political ally, run up the national debt, and is threatening to start a third major war. While you should be an expert on dumb, you don&#39;t seem to recognize how out of touch with the majority of Americans you are. Lay off the carbs.CNN should fire her yesterdayThis chick is a real Cunt!Good Finally someone from CNN telling the truth!  The Dems went off the Deep end!FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE NEWS&quot;portended it to be&quot;<br />Wow, Trump has the BEST WORDS. Except that portend is a warning of something that WILL happen not a description of WHAT happened.Who&#39;s going to keep paying their high cost Health Insurance when America is offering it for free.  Dumb people will keep their high cost insurance, and that might be a good reason why they don&#39;t matter.  Not everybody likes to throw money away for high cost name brands.damm she got boob yob?VomitI tried to pay attention but that tight white top distracted mewhat kind of name is S.E. CuppThese CNN guys really do not get it. The country is going more left than they think. Especially with the millenials who are the future. As long as CNN and the Dems believe in being &quot;moderate&quot; they are gonna lose in 2020. Why? Coz in being moderate, they are no longer standing up for the little guy.Yes unemployment is the lowest and Kamala Harris did say that it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt show that most Americans have 2 or 3 jobs and that‚Äôs unfair. SE is manipulating the opinion... Kamala was right...Bravo for this commentator, who&#39;s trying to break out of the Left wing language ghetto she lives in. Heretics often make the best critics.I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.- Will RogersLook at SE Cupp&#39;s body language (very trumpian). CNN&#39;s answer to promote trump, never thought I&#39;d see the day. Shame!This is one of the dumbest things Cupp ever said.Let&#39;s talk about the real issues...how hot is this woman üòçAs Trump world say, this woman is a low I.Q. individual and a looser.I know SE Cupp is a Republican, but I also know she is NOT a fan of trump. Possibly she thinks the die hard fan base for trump could be swayed but I am not as confident.THIS is what this woman took from the Democratic debates?!?! Why is she on CNN? Or ATT ALL on TV?!? What a waste of air time putting on a Fox news reject. Not worth to watch....I hate her. She&#39;s a corporatist, establishment shill.Por-tended ? ü§îThe virus of liberalism seems to be running it&#39;s courseIt‚Äôs not saying they know better and that people are dumb. It is them saying the hard truthIgnorant is bliss..isn&#39;t it..America is sooo far behind now..can&#39;t even build a decent car or a pair of socks for that matter..Se cupp is a nymphomaniac for swamp monstersWho is this hack? And why does CNN keep broadcasting these people? Please hire some journalists with some journalistic integrity that know how to research and frame logical empirical arguments.THE PRESIDENT IS A TERRORIST BLOWING PUTIN AND YOU&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT STUPID SHIT. REPUBLICUNTTRUMP IS THE MOST USELESS UNAMERICAN UNQALIFIED EXCREMENT OF HUMANITY&#39;S FILTH CUNTdo some homework... lady. the economy is soaring for the wealthy... majority are not wealthy! get it in your head.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9tGMUq4XEQ&amp;t=0m57s">0:57</a> - &quot;portended&quot; ? I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect intelligence from a puppet.You leftists should think about Venezuela.The Democratic Primary is not really the place that Republicans will be available to reach out to...that usually happens during the General elections. I wish Conservatives would remember that this is only the beginning of the Primary season, if they wish to change party affiliation they would be part of the choice of the Democratic Nominee.se cupp is the hottestWhattttt???!!!!  CNN catching some sense?! Wow!!üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªWaaaah!!!!

I don&#39;t recall a segment where you say &quot;People who don&#39;t want to pay for OTHER billionaires tax bills for them&quot;I‚Äôm for car insurance for everybody who wants it.  Does that make me less progressive?Centralist Democrats are for the status quo.  So they are basically republicans.We are certainly not dealing with Winston Churchill with you Trump, more like Archie. BTW, how do make Trump&#39;s eyes shine? Shine a torch in each ear.You want Democrats to be Republican light.  It&#39;s your party that created this Frankenstein of a president. Now you want to shift the blame to the Democrats.CNN...what should we expect...thought they might have something journalistic or relevant..DUH-ME....LOLThese comments prove SE is right. You idiots are going to hand Trump another four more years. Free healthcare for illegal immigrants? Open borders? You&#39;re fucking idiots.Clearly liberals can‚Äôt handle the truth. Thank you SE for speaking the truth. There should be restrictions on abortion. Illegal immigrants do NOT deserve free healthcare (how do you even budget for that???). Private healthcare should NOT be eliminated. Democrats are trying to lose the election with these debates. If Democrats want to win the general election, they will elect a moderate candidate in the primaries.Hey CNN send this chick to fox. Please for the love of God. The truth is that the GOP dont give a dam about the environment or the American people. Please take this bleached blond off of this network.Trump üá∫üá∏ MAGA ! 2020.SE has overdosed on twat. Now she has bubbles in her &quot;brain&quot;Nobody‚Äôs asking for poor kids‚Äô parents to pay for other kids‚Äô education. Then again, a lot of people are too stupid to understand the benefits to themselves that an educated society affords them.I don&#39;t like Trump but this was hilarious  !!<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s not like he&#39;s Winston Churchill. &quot; Hahahahanext debate who can blow soros the best lolUghh now I remember why I cannot stand Meghan McCains bff!! She has absolutely no clue!! She&#39;s an idiot because moderates and conservatives absolutely want rich people to pay more in taxes and want Healthcare.. I cannot stand her! 72% want Medicare for All  to say if you don&#39;t want it pay $500mth plus a co-pay and deductibles instead of not paying anything like that is just weird.. What happens if you lose your job? There goes your Healthcare.. Why can&#39;t people just look at Finland, Canada, UK ect?CNN is run and owned by warmongering Jews,they love bloodshed in the Middle East. At least Trump is trying to hold back these warmongers.This clueless bitch just earned zero of my respect. Out of touch rich bitchAnd then we have van Jones. A useful idiot.Pardon me if I don&#39;t advice from someone that makes no effort to understand or analyze polling or policy with any detail. If you hate Donald Trump why would you want to promote the same policies and politicians that opened a lane for Trump to win?I was just about to light this bitch up but I saw all the beautiful comments left by the beautiful American people that all saw right through her bullshit. every single one of Bernie Sanders policies has the majority of support from the American people.Wahmen is never wrong.Trump 2020 üëçI usually like S.E.<br />&quot;But your wrong&quot;... I like Van see it differently.My God!!!!! Somebody at CNN that seems to ACTUALLY talk with sense and logic. At least CNN seems to have someone who seems to know what they&#39;re talking about. This could help make CNN look MORE like a news channel rather than the propaganda wing of the democrat party that it is!!!!!!!!She would know what dumb is since she looks at it every day in the mirror.Trump is going to win  a second term garunteed ü§¶üòÅWow, this is THE dumbest piece I&#39;ve seen on CNN for some time now, and that&#39;s saying something, The Majority of the public want medicare for all, the majority want to clear or reduce the student debt etc, just because the centrists don&#39;t believe the evidence based facts, doesn&#39;t mean everyone else is wrong. Also, in part, the debates are to educate the people on how the plans WOULD work, they are not IMPLEMENTING policy, they are providing possible OPTIONS, Because many in the public are un-informed, or mis-informed by FOX and CNN, Medicare for all gives you EVERYTHING, take the best possible private plan you can think of, something that covers all ailments with ZERO deductible, That is the standard for Medicare for all, There will be nothing private can offer that medicare for all wont already offer,  well maybe an over-priced gold toilet seat, but nothing medically essential, also, single payer would mean there is effectivly only ONE health network, &quot;medicare&quot;, If you allow private insurance to offer alternative medical care, then there will be hospitals and doctors on separate networks and you wont get the doctor you want, Under single payer (without private option) you have the ONLY method that guarantees choice of ANY doctor/facility you want!You are so right, let&#39;s listen to a liar that says 10K lies and everything he does is A+ always the best ever.  Give me a break!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23believeme">#believeme</a>Every mainstream media outlet is running the same right wing perspective, they will be left behind in the new revolution.CNN you better get rid of this cunt!!! FOX NEWS SPY Counterproductive at its finest!!!!I have to agree, Harris didn&#39;t do anything outstanding other than play race.Truth is, democratic media is starting to be scared of what they have created.Keep tepeating your message. The democrats are going to shoot themselves in the foot.CNN= JERRY SPRINGER SHOW!She&#39;s right, I hate it.LOL these leftist comments.  You sure love your fake news CNN and the lies they spew.  Pretty scary when someone comes on your channel and tells you something truthful, isn‚Äôt it?  You need a celebrity to come save the day and tell you to kill your babies and let illegals into the country (not your neighbourhoods of course, but still)...The only good thing from this puppet is them big titties. With that said. Trump is at the south korea dmz and you are not covering it. Completely pathetic fake newsThose people can&#39;t vote in the primary.But not as bad as Trump&#39;s moronic answer to the question!Cupp is a Republican. Democrats should do the right thing, not the populist thing.The democrats are not the party to please moderates and those who votes for trump- the most disenfranchised voters in the USA are progressives- for too long conservatives have been dictating politics- and look what we have kids I. Cages and failed healthcare system and workers living paycheck to paycheck- cnn are conservative privileged people ya average conservative voters perspectiveIt really doesnt matter, at the end of the day ref 2020 election people will vote with their wallets,therefore Trump wins....plus, no one wants that loser democratic platform.I am pretty sure trying to appease rabid Trumps supporters is a pointless and failed strategy. Ask Hillary or wait..are you STILL shilling for the status quo CNN? Yeah I thought so. Also you keep using the word &#39;majority&#39;..you are pulling that word out of your arse Cupp, what majority, how bout we go to poll data and look at what Americans actually think about those &quot;out lefting&quot; policies such as medicare for all, taxing the rich, climate action, immigration reform...you will find the majority do care about these issues and overwhelmingly on the left.<br />This is such centrist garbage.Lots of triggered Libtards here! LoLOh so Hillary was too far to the left and not enough to right, that&#39;s why she lost? We need to go more to the right? Even tho they will still call you communists no matter what.

It&#39;s always good to listen to a different opinion.&quot;Voluntary busing was not the issue.&quot;   It was not, but Kamala Harris&#39;  program was voluntary  busing.  She did not participate in any program that  Biden opposed,  but she&#39;s implying that she did.  She&#39;s a lying slanderer,  she campaigns using the same slander techniques that Trump uses.   I can never ever support such a slandering deceiver for President,  especially one born into  greater privilege than 90% of electorate,  who shucks and jives otherwise.Yes you&#39;re wrong, because you don&#39;t see the major issues facing the majority of people. You misread the signs of a strong economy ( based on your meter)  and due to your misdiagnosis and severity of the problem, and your tribalistic view to conservative values and inertia toward a major move which is desperately needed, (not to mention your faulty critical thinking), you stick to the most problematic center right candidate and try to shove it down everyone&#39;s throatThis segment clearly showcases CNN&#39;s right-wing corporate bias. This reporter&#39;s intro basically criticizes the DNC for being too far left, as if they are radical, which they simply are not.Ah CNN is sooo biased booboo fake news.

Please, go over to Fox.Pretty poor reasoning Ms Cupp. Looks like you are looking for an argument that doesn&#39;t exist.Sad.Can we just send ms Cupp to Fox News? I think she&#39;d be a lot more comfortable there.Democrats are traitors to America.All make up, no IQ no EQ, a typical fox girlHmm, Cupp didn‚Äôt bring marmoset snacks tonight. The cry is deafening.i swear this bitch always looks pissed off, it&#39;s no wonder nbc let her go, bet she has some real anger issues off cameraUS politics is one of the stupidest I have ever seen. How would one elect a president and then not supporting him, not knowing  he is helping America?But there are a lot of ctries which copy American models. What are these ppl doing? Your channel must well change to become a gossipy channel, rather than a news channel. You elect a president and and lambast him in his policies all the time. So funny, humanslook at a the polls you are talking out your ass, these are not far left ideas, they are centristdid I click on a Fox News video by accident?CNN you need to find another person to take this broads place, seriously. She is offensive and very over confident. She shouldn&#39;t  be either, by the way.YangThose two nights are going to be hard to recover from<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9tGMUq4XEQ&amp;t=0m41s">0:41</a> &quot;I think, probably he was hit harder than he should have been hit. It wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as they portended it to be.&quot;<br /><br /><br />That&#39;s because they&#39;re sparring for you! Yeah, it&#39;s nothing compared to your obstruction, illegal payments to porn stars, secret meetings without aides and memos, suing Congress for doing its duties, and having your AG act as your personal lawyer... peanuts in comparison. But don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll get some punches too, soon...S E Cupp sounds like a new style bra....send her to Fox, please.Oh I bet this is hard to swallow for all you socialistsWhat tha hell are you talking about? You are an idiot, just get your facts right.SE. Dems are on the LEFT. You are a Republican, they aren‚Äôt trying to appeal to your values...and <i>news flash</i> there are several Democratic candidates that are for Medicare for all <i>plus</i> supplemental private insurance, securing the border and not offering undocumented people healthcare, not offering 100% subsidized college tuition and student loan forgiveness. Not all candidates are way far left. Trust me, us progressives know who they are and we don‚Äôt be voting for them.Holy shit. A pair of tits with an opinion....Lady you are so full of Shit.  Why Has CNN been out Foxing Fox.   Stupid Bitch shut your face and go home and think about your life.Trump is a weak pussy man trump is a racist himself this is why he said he was a good guyMajor burnI&#39;d rather they cater to the disaffected democrats that didn&#39;t want Hillary since they&#39;re the reason Trump won too and they&#39;re not racist assholesI don&#39;t much like this woman. She&#39;s kinda of abrupt and a little overly pushy for my taste. Will go somewhere else till Monday. Thankyou, &amp; good night.See cupp stay in your Buble where you matter with your fat do nothing salaryLast time you idiots went with a centrist, establishment and someone who was loved by corporations and who beat her? A conman who said he would give healthcare to people. Run a progressive and they will actually win. You are paid to defend CNN because they don&#39;t want to pay higher taxes but seriously just admit that and stop lying about what the people want. They are so sick of your corporate first BS that they elected Donald Trump, so let someone who is actually for real change make a stand and get out of their way. Go Bernie and Warren.This lady has no clue and is clearly defending Biden the loser candidate of the bunch but hey CNN likes him.Weren‚Äôt these clowns saying trump not getting along with Kim is a reflection of his legacy? All of a sudden he makes peace and he‚Äôs a dictator? Wtf this is the crap that has completely destroyed cnnThey have gone way too left! Millennials eat it up and they don&#39;t vote! Especially when their Bernie doesn&#39;t get nominated.Yang actually gets a lot of interest from republicans. I am from Texas and I hear republicans mention him a lot. They aren&#39;t even worried about any of the others. <br /><br /><br />1. Kamala Harris - She will be labeled as the sassy black women. Unfortunately because of hollywood movies this is a thing.<br />2. Biden - already being labeled as sleepy and creepy. <br />3. Pete - lol, never gonna happen. Republican straight men just don&#39;t vote for gay people.<br />4 Bernie - never gonna happen. He could have won in 2016 but now its too late, everyone thinks he is a socialist.<br />5 Booker - No one is going to vote another half black guy in. If there is a black president he needs to be hardcore black. <br />6. Beto - Perhaps. He came close in Texas. He could get the latino vote over all. Women think he is cute. He is energetic but he will need a ton of funding. <br /> <br />Then we have Yang. He talks about self empowerment, battling the inevitable automation, and looking to the future. Young people see him as the hope they need in the face of a world turning into artificial intelligence.Wasn‚Äôt she once a right winger?Great break down of the Democrat debate. &quot;you&#39;re Wrong&quot;. Socialists control the People and how they think. Take Russia, if you did not agree with their policies you were sent to the Salt Mines. It has taken an Outsider to open up the Washington Can of Corruption. Where is Adam Schiff? He has taken an Air Force Plane to Scandinavia at Tax Payers Expense.Establishment democrat 101The Democrats are turning too much to the left. That is dangerous.hey all, im SE cupp, fake atheist and fake centrist.<br /><br />good, this schtick has gotten so old over the years.SE Cupp when you goin to Fox?Never thought I would agree with this women.Had to double check to see if this was on the official CNN YouTube channel. What a joke. Dislikes tell the story.WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT THE DRAFT DODGER SAYS?!?!?!??!?! SERIOUSLY!!!!!!By reading all these comments I&#39;m guessing people had forgotten that SE Cup is an Republican! Not all CNN journalists are Democrats and she is not the only one!Yeah you&#39;re right SE trump voters shouldn&#39;t be considered, they aren&#39;t even the majority so fuck em, pass me you&#39;re number and I&#39;l fu....whoops wife is watching.What is it with these right wingers?  The mean spirit.  The lies.<br />No woman is going to carry a baby for 8 months and then abort it.  That&#39;s just a nasty  and creepy charge.<br />Everyone should have healthcare.  Republicans want death panels.<br />And we have trillions in tax cuts for billionaires and corporations but education is terrible free stuff?<br />Amazon made over 11 billion last year in profit and paid zero in federal taxes.  The CEO makes 1.5 billion a week.<br />But it&#39;s middle class kids that shouldn&#39;t be allowed &#39;free stuff&#39; like education and healthcare.  In fact, we subsidize companies like Amazon giving their workers food stamps and healthcare because they don&#39;t get paid enough.  And Republicans still manage to sell those horrible messages to the American people.  And they buy it.Are you aware that a majority of Americans support Bernie‚Äôs policies? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieTulsi2020">#BernieTulsi2020</a>Um, Yang?Sounds like SE Tucker CarlsonThis 2 girls 1 SE Cupp chick tends to constantly make a stink face.

IF YOU NEED THE DEFENITION OF AMERICAN CITIZEN I CAN HELP.God I hate this bitch!PELOSI FOR PRESIDENT.  Save the children.  They come first.Damn, does SE Cupp think The Democratic Party should be a shelter for &quot;Ex&quot; Republicans??? LOL<br />This platform that you hate (M4A, Tuition free public colleges...Etc) is pulling Favorably among voters. If you don&#39;t like it, you can go back to your Trump-infested Party &amp; try to fix it.<br />Good luck with that.So if the stock market is doing good I should b happy <br />Even tho I don‚Äôt make money off the stock market <br />And more people are working for shit payWhy should Democrat‚Äôs reach out to republicans and why wasn‚Äôt that question a thing in the republican debates for the 2016 elections!? Republicans are full of shit! If you are still a Republican after all the atrocities, then you are an immoral POS and I don‚Äôt care what you want! Get your soul back, then talk!You Democrats have so many clowns running for president in 2020... We can reopen Ringling Brothers!<br /><br />Apparently, none of you morons mind paying for college kids who made bad decisions... Took out student loans... So they can get an education... But you who never went to college and just has a sort of mediocre job.... Now have to pay off their loan..... And apparently oh, you don&#39;t mind paying for illegal aliens to come here and give them Healthcare you don&#39;t mind footing that bill either...... oh and let&#39;s not forget reparations..... People who were never slaves are now going to get paid by people who never owned slaves.... Actually it should be the Democrats who have to pay them because Democrats are the only ones who owned slaves from 1860 forward.....If Democrats refuse to hold Impeachment Hearings, Trump will be a two-term president. It&#39;s that simple.Did you see the report about the NAZIS (Antifa) assaulting a journalist in Portland? I can&#39;t find it anywhere on CNNShe has some big tits....What 71% is she talking about? Can anyone tell me ?Hey, SE, they were discussing topics that the majority of Americans care about. Having healthcare, stopping a climate catastrophe, the cruel torture of children at our concentration camps, etc. You know, things that polled in the +70% range. What planet do you live on? I guess it&#39;s not surprising that you&#39;re bitching and complaining, though. You ARE a conservative, after all, and you&#39;re also clearly part of the media machine that tries to spin reality and control the narrative in this country. Don&#39;t kid yourself: you&#39;re not a journalist. You&#39;re a fake mouthpiece. Just like Tomi Lahren and Meghan McCain. Another obnoxious blonde chick who thinks she knows everything and can only (attempt to) report on stories using snark and smartass-ism. If you removed your head out of your ass every once in awhile, you might see the real world around you, not just the insides of your bowels. Which would explain that shitty-looking &quot;thing&quot; you&#39;re wearing, BTW.Do republicans care about attracting potential democrats? If the economy is doing well, why there is such wide income inequality?Trump Train------------------- Choooo Choooo------------- you are fake news lolthese dislikes are so confusing.  like right wing people think cnn is fake news, but se cupp is on here making the same points she did when she was over at fox.  and the real kicker is cnn is kinda bullshitty and have a corporate bias soo..? confused.S.E and many others SEEM to think anyone who is at all liberal is &quot;far&quot;-left or &quot;radical&quot; !!! WRONG!Was this a screen test for Fox?  Weird take on the debate.  We want a President who isn‚Äôt chronic liar.  Trump‚Äôs number are way down. I really hope we don‚Äôt to see you again.  And get a consult on your on air wardrobe .  We‚Äôre hoping to salvage our democracy. We have a president who cozies up to Putin, to Kim and the Chinese. Did I mention the chronic lying?Lock üîí all the doors and burn cnnüè´üî•down üì∏And more news from the liberal wack pack...THE MAJORITY of voters did not vote for Trump in 2016 AND will not in 2020! The MAJORITY of Americans do NOT want Trump re-elected!The establishment speaks. We the people say, GO TO HELL!!!Cupp, you&#39;re a frigging loser.dont worry chump cant b in office more than 8yrs by that time MEXICO will have our land back usa will b 1more bankruptcy 2 chump&#39;s many this time MEXICO takes women only  PILGRIMSFor medic-care for all to work you have to force everyone to participate financially in the system. If you don&#39;t it will be too expensive.Out lefting each otherWow everyone should have the right to pay more for worse health insurance? NOBODY LOVES THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE, they love their health care, their doctors/hospitals. Majority of people don&#39;t know much about their health insurance, till they need to use it. Because they don&#39;t choose it, their employer does, and they&#39;re trying to save money, not care for their employees.Back in my younger days I was a democrat . Thats cause they still believed in some of the stuff she said here.  Now im a independent voter. The democratic party today is turning into the party of free shit.  The republicans have there problems to but they still believe in people getting a job. . Dems want somebody to pay for there college.  But why go to college your to lazy to work anyway.  You have no values of hard work and your morals are dogshit.  Republicans have issues to but at least there morals are better and they arent scared of hard work.SE Cupp is out of touch with reality. <br />She has no clue of the hardships of the middle class and speaks to those who are well off.I&#39;m a Democrate and absolutely agree with what she is saying.Van you&#39;re a sellout to the black community. How can you sit there and be ok with illegal immigration when it hurts our communities the most. Fck off.Telling people they are wrong when they are wrong is called truth.SE Cupp has rendered herself totally unfuckable. And is it just me or is she getting fat as fuck? LOLGOP=Corruption Lies Criminals Racists Hypocrites Traitors Cowards Unamerican Idiots DirtyBe careful your white privilege is showingWhy is she so ANGRY did she voted for Trumpü§î both of them are out of touch for a minute I thought it was fox newsü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èOh boy this feels like a fox news broadcast.. 2nd vid from SE Cupp showing weird signs towards Bernie / WarrenShe the SMARTEST host CNN has!!!!! Listen to her!!!! Donald Trump go KILL them if they come with the same bull crap dems was talking at debateThe economy can&#39;t be doing well with the national debt sky rocketing. People love to ignore that fact. How many people are working multiple jobs to put food on the table? The economy is great if you are at the very top of the food chain and you benefitted from a huge tax cut.  If you drive a brand new truck, brand new car, rvs, have a big house and a pool and you owe far more than you can handle, that&#39;s not good. Same with national debt.In this clip, you see the abject fear &amp; panic from corporate MSM (fox, cnn, nbc, all the same...just like corporate dems &amp; republicans, bought &amp; paid for). Americans are seeing through the lies, distractions, &amp; division fomented by the 1% over the last 40-50 years, manufacturing consent that we must to cling to &quot;the center&quot; that has steadily crept right. While they have us fighting each other &amp; punching down, the rich get richer at our expense. When injustice becomes law, revolution becomes duty. (We&#39;re done simply resisting.)You&#39;re WRONG SE Cupp! ;))CNN viewers will be happy to know that Youtube has banned, shadow banned or demonitized almost all of the Conservative sites, giving CNN the much needed advantage they need. <br />Where would Liberalism be without censorship and media bias?100 Days in office and the Dems have done squat. What a waste of votes.Tell me more miss full tits c cupTrump said horrible shit about all voters . But you most likely don&#39;t remember  .If it actually makes sense than it&#39;s fox news. CNN doesn&#39;t do common sense. You indulge in fantasy.  Somebody has to pay for all the free shit you want. You think you are going to make the rich do it.  But the rich will put you in the ground before they pay for your worthless ass.  They will leave your america,  enough rich leave the burden of taking care of worthless people than falls on the middle class.  If you not smart enough to no that the rich will get out of it than I can&#39;t help you.  It&#39;s going to be funny watching you idiots kill each other someday when socialism falls.  I&#39;m already low income and only care for myself.Lmao, she might as well be on Fox News. She&#39;s basically saying, &quot;Why don&#39;t Democrats be Republicans?&quot; ü§£ü§£ü§£Lost me at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9tGMUq4XEQ&amp;t=3m00s">3:00</a>.

It‚Äôs her angle. Dismiss her. She doesn‚Äôt matter. She‚Äôs just another opinion spinning bullshit. She never presets factsThe dems need another Bill Clinton. He appealed to everyone. Far left will destroy dem party.You criticize Warren and others for saying people are wrong if they believe this or that. Okay, Cupp, did you do anything to refute their claims? Voters can be very wrong about a great many things. Just look who&#39;s President. These people need to be made more aware. Warren doesn&#39;t just claim people are wrong, she explains why. She&#39;s attempting to educate them. Calling them wrong is quite mild compared to terms that would describe most of them more accurately.Damn, Se Cupp has gone to a Triple D...This news lady is scum.Dumbest video ever.

Debates were horrible.When did the news became all exclusive Op-ed pieces!<br />I thought the duty of a journalist was not to insert themselves into the story and look at things objectively.<br />This is anything but that. <br />CNN, MSNBC, FOX, all are the essentially the same!They&#39;re all socialist commie Nazi&#39;s. What happened to true Democrats like Bill Clinton, ones that sounded a little more left than Trump, you know the slightly conservative Democrats. These morons are going to take away healthcare from everyone with this Medicare for all crap. It&#39;s going to cost over 300k jobs in the private health insurance sector. 70% of hospitals in our country are based on private health insurance so there&#39;s 70% of health care workers jobless too. So how many millions of people will be out of work and not be able to pay the higher taxes, i heard somewhere that Bernie is predicting that the middle class will be paying 45-50% in taxes and those of us who are now paying less than 10% thanks to Trump&#39;s tax plan will be paying over 30%. I barely survived the 18% I was paying before Trump fixed it. Socialism doesn&#39;t work... Countries go broke and their people flee to ours.  Just support border security and immigration laws and don&#39;t destroy America to get them to go back to their countries.Open borders? Dems are nuts.S E Cupp should be on FOXVan Jones is the right person to enlighten this dense chic!Why should an illegal get free healthcare, but I have to pay for mine?D-Cup says what ?If you disagree with this lady then you are far far fucking left. Radical left.  She is a moderate in the middle Democrat. We used to have thousands of them back in my younger days.  They where are replaced with radicals I guess. If you think the United States should give free health care to it&#39;s own people that&#39;s okay.  But if you think we should give free health care to the entire world than you are nuts.  Common sense people no it wont work. Idiots have to try it first to see it wont work.Damn she fine!Every video this dumbass does gets more dislikes than likesüòÇüòÇüëéüëéüëéüëéCnn, you are wrong by hiring this ridiculous commentor.Dems are in trouble. Not one candidate sparks fire in the base across the board.They all looked like idiots and Trump did win the debate.Van Jones your a fucken retard...holy shit. How the fuck can you justify offering free health care to Illegals when we dont offer it to citizens..  You wanna decriminalize border crossings and then offer the free health care and then what the fuck will stop every sick person in the world from showing up at your local emergency room...  Dems you continue to blow me away with your stupidity.You do know that if an American visits any other country in the world, they would get healthcare, right?Use Independent Media for Real Newsyang? did you see his closing statement??...don&#39;t point out the stupidity, let them bury themselves.Nice tits , I&#39;m sure they are fake tooWho the hell are you anyway?who in there right mind would believe Acostas unemployment numbers anyways!?! trumps whole administration is corrupt af and acosta isn&#39;t any different...remember acosta is the one who covered up Jeffrey epstein&#39;s crimes of child molestation and a bunch of other crimes of the same nature! and we&#39;re talking about hundreds of underage girls as young as 14 (probably younger too) anyways this scumbag Epstein should of gotten life, instead he gets 18 months, why? because he&#39;s a billionaire and rene Alexander acosta is corrupt af!!! so again...why would anyone in there right mind believe these record breaking unemployment numbers!?! I sure as hell dont!!! numbers/rates/percentages are really easy to manipulate anyways.I thought the Twilight Zone stuff was creepy and cool at the same time.  The lady from 1979 with the love power and fantasy projection had a real science fiction feel. . . . .But Wow !! Those people are right off the hook crazy. Everyone sees it.This is just common sense talking points something leftists in America don&#39;t have. Virtually every topic the Democrat candidates are pushing and backing so hard is not popular to the majority of Americans. People who never see what others have to say people who only watch the CNN&#39;s and the MSNBCs they aren&#39;t aware that most thing&#39;s they push so hard to be accepted are not acceptable by most and never will be most people aren&#39;t dumb enough to believe that Medicare for all is possible without huge consequences. Or college tuitions paid these thing&#39;s will never be reality. The only people who like hearing these thing&#39;s are the dumb and lazy. Most Americans are neither even those on the left most of them work and don&#39;t want to be taxed into the fucking poor house so college kids get a free eduction. Why would anyone except college kids. Dims are on a free giveaway spree hoping the masses will say I want something for nothing but most of us know nothing in life is free. If it&#39;s not broke don&#39;t try to fix it. America is not broke and most people know this.Trump, &quot;not nearly as bad as they potended it to be ... &quot; ??Illegal immigrants pay taxes as much as most American yet they get no benefits and work in jobs that few americans will.<br />Medicare is paid by all taxpayers including illegal immagrants.Ya may not like this person but she right come on everything is beating trump sound like 2016 and they Argue over healthcare for citizens but illegals get it for free come onYou idiots don&#39;t seem to understand that there is no such thing as &quot;free healthcare.&quot; You idiots are too dumb to realize that citizens will be paying half of there income as insurance for some day when they might need healthcare. Products like smokes, beer, food or anything that is deemed unhealthy and adds to healthcare costs will get taxed extra as well. You will have ridiculous wait times for service, immigrants will get better healthcare then you, and you will keep paying higher and higher taxes for the immigrants and illegals that keep pouring in that require healthcare. You will be 2nd class citizens in your own country treated much like the Natives were and will probably even have to be forced to accept others cultures while yours is destroyed to accommodate the illegals and mass immigration. I know this as a Canadian in my 30s and I feel like i&#39;m an outcast in my own country. Old stock blood Canadians are being discriminated against as well as the Natives.Who is this women....Medi care for all doesn‚Äôt work if you can‚Äôt get everyone on board?mommy{Mary Anne MacLeod) ,scotland &amp; daddy&#39;{Friedrich Trump), German &#39; &amp; newest immigrant wife{MELANIATrump;born Melanija Knavs)Slovenian &quot;.

HOLY SHIT!!!One of the dumbest comments i ve ever seen. Seems SE is has absolutely no idea all the things she doesnt like are standard in all other developed countries. Greetings from Germany.why is the audio recorded so low? rookies making these videos?  this is part of the problem that causes commercials to be so loudThis is SE‚Äôs hey look I‚Äôm still definitely republican for sure see look.<br />Van jones has a one line response and immediately she goes mmmmm ü§£Why does CNN keep giving praise to tRump.??

You sound like Trump and his lackeys.WOW! The GOP has taken over CNN!Oh, I hope and pray that a woman...whether as Presidential candidate or on the ticket...beats the hell out of Trump.  Just desserts.SE Cupp thinks that the Republicans care about America!SE Cupp no one said you can not have private insurance, every western country that has medical coverage for its citizens has private health care and insurance. As far as the undocumented people here, those who are working pay taxes so they do pay for the right to have health care. Also other countries will give medical care for our citizens when they are abroad. <br /><br />And many people who are employed are actually under employed, they are not paid actual working wages. ou really should actual study and get factes before opening your ignorant mouth.Foolish comments! CNN  is smart to have alternstive commentary. Just so happens she&#39;s right anyway. Trump is not qualified and a total ass but the Democrats are about to hand him a reelection.<br />Trump&#39;s 30% is solid. The other 70% don&#39;t like Trump but are fragmented. Some of that 70% like their guns and hate illegal immigration. Some are independents. As an independent I didn&#39;t like the direction of the debate.Wasn&#39;t this lady on fox before?Vote democrat is you want a choice on Medicare.you are really stupid. People want to change the way Washington works. Policies are important to mainstream Americans. Wealth inequality is a very important issue.Notice a conservative is saying going left will help them lose. But when republicans in 2016 did it no one said a word and trump won.... Isn&#39;t that funny? Its almost like miss cupp is and has been wrong.... Propaganda is a dangerous thing and you end up with people like trump when you listen to it as advice. This is why they call CNN fake news because they are nothing more then propaganda on their best day.I have to agree with Van... They should not force free health care on people, they should have a choice to keep Obama care.  I also agree with Van that illegal<br />immigrants already are costing billions and we should close Ice and not have interior enforcement.  It is costing way to much to enforce our boarder<br />when everyone should be able to reach the American dream.    I also agree that we should eliminate the constitution and move towards the ideals<br />of sharia law.That&#39;s it, I&#39;m done with cnn.BLEACHüíäBIT HILARY<br />The [Super PREDATOR]<br />Hunter 20/20üëàüòÑüá∫üá∏Bitch, 3 people own more shit than the bottom 50%, and it doesn&#39;t matter how many people are employed if everyone&#39;s working two jobs and STILL can&#39;t pay their fuckin&#39; bills!

Elsewhere. Go elsewhere.Thumbs way down. This is stomach turning and stupid.With all due respect, fuck you ms. cupp.Yep S.E.Cupp, what you need to do to beat Trump is lie from now until the end of your life. You need to sexually abuse women at least 16 or so times. You need to sell the country to the Russians, kneel to the North Koreans, accept that Saudis will murder American journalists after torturing them, and commit treason out in the open. You need to violate every law, defecate on the constitution, piss on all American institutions. You need to turn your back on every value and ideal. You need to take peoples healthcare from them. You need to take away welfare from those who need it and put the money back in the pockets of the needy rich people who are doing so hard. You need to promote and give tax cuts to the poorest billionaires and millionaires while adding trillions to the deficit. You need to rip up signed treaties, attack allies while kissing up to dictators and despots. You need to wage trade wars against other nations without knowing how to cut any deal which may be better than the current one. You need to make Americans pay for the tariffs and then lie to them that they don&#39;t. You need to attack the FBI, CIA, other intelligence agencies, while denigrating the court systems. You need to basically do nothing else in two years except cheat at golf, obstruct justice at every moment, allow your worthless family to enrich themselves by violating every constitutional norm. You need to take credit for an economy  which you inherited from the previous administration, call the greatest economy ever even when independent facts and figures show that it grew strongest under Obama, who was handed a recession and two costly wars by George W Bush. You need basically to be a repugnant creature who has no interest in government or governing, who has no love for the country, no care for the people, except for those who may put money in your pocket, and be a 100 percent racist who peddles in hate driven by the most malignant of lies. So, according to Ms. Cupp this is what the Democrats need to do to beat someone who fell into the white house due to a small win in the electoral college, even after losing the popular vote by 3 million votes or so. The last election was a referendum more on Clinton than a desire to vote for Donald Scumbag  Trump and yet she won the peoples vote by a crushing 3 million more votes. The 2020 election will be a referendum on Trump and all the vile and evil things that he has done and said. The only thing that you need to beat this cancer on American society and on the world is simply to be human, something that he is not. If that isn&#39;t enough then we are truly lost.Van Jones is so wrong.Why are our debates a spectator event now? We need a president to fix the economy, keep ww3 from happening, and single payer healthcare. We need a younger than 60yo president.In the US moderate means right wing. The democratic party has been highjacked by  corporate democrats over the last 30 years. Time to take our party back.<br />Bernie/Liz 2020I consider myself Liberal, but damn, everyone here is so stupidly left that you all think SE Cupp is republican? Wow.Someone forgot to tell her that popular left wing ideas; medicare for all, livable minimum wage, ending wars, women‚Äôs reproductive rights, and taxing the rich are majority favored, and the dem candidates are ‚Äútoo far left‚Äù somehow?You ARE wrong. Keep up that centrist approach you&#39;ll fucking LOSE AGAIN in 2020! <br /><br />We&#39;ve done that in 2016 and how did it work for ya Cupp bitch?? Fucking corporate puppetAnd this bitch is so fuckin stupid !! When do you ask about republicans reaching out to democratic voters ??? Huh??? Yea never heard it from ANYONE in mainstream media. Remember the republican debates in 2016??? They didn‚Äôt reach out to a fuckin single democratic voter it was all fear mongering and sucking up to the base. THATS WHY REPUBLICANS WIN THEY DONT RUN FROM THEIR BASE !!!! YOU LITERALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND POLITICS AT ALL SE CUPP! You‚Äôre a MORON. Plus?? Like I said before?? The big ideas ARE supported by republicans so by putting forth those big ideas?? They ARE reaching out to republicans! We‚Äôd be helping ALL people ! Medicare has BETTER coverage than private insurance and people overwhelmingly support it ! And of course dumbass Van Jones comes on to say we shouldn‚Äôt be listening to the giant majority of people that say they want Medicare for all. And people that say the economy is working? Unfortunately they ARE wrong . Wages have been stagnant when adjusted for inflation for the last 30 years !! Just because unemployment is low and the stock market is good doesn‚Äôt mean SHIT! It means the rich are doing well because only the top 10% have anything in the stock market and unemployment being low? Means 2 things . Either people are just working shit jobs with crappy wages OR people have given up looking for work so it doesn‚Äôt get added into those numbers . These are FACTS. But moronic SE cupp don‚Äôt understand shit and live in a bubble of elites that all agree with them! Too bad it‚Äôs not even close to representative of the entire country . The country DOES want Medicare for all, college for all, universal child care, ending insane regime change wars, raising taxes on the rich , etc etc etc etc ! Those are all supported by majorities SE !! Where‚Äôs your concern about THOSE majorities ???? Yea thought so. You only cite majorities when they agree with you !Yang Gang FTW. Dems killing themselves with extreme liberal financial views.She an idiot.  Voters are not going to find a politician that&#39;s going to fullfill 100% of their values/cause. I&#39;m a voter who is looking forward to ANYBODY that has former government experience and bring peace back into this country and remove Mitch.Eat the rich, this may not be fox but this chick is all about the money.SE Coup is just another out of touch actor wanna-be journalist member of the mass media machine.SE CUpp???? Bwaaaaaahaaaahaaaahaaaaa! <br />Gross! Fire this gross fox ladyWhy is she so biased, it feels like fox news tfNotice she never tslks about the hundreds of billions of &quot;free stuff&quot; corporate welfare handed out every yearI am so glad to see that CNN is so in touch with the people.Straight corporate-propagandaThe Man, The legend, Donald J Trump. Those Democrats donors might as well save their money. Those Dems sure are a loopy bunch. It‚Äôs hilarious ü§£And hey Van ??? Shut your fuckin mouth. Medicare for all IS supported by the majority of people . They don‚Äôt wanna keep their private insurance they just want to keep being able to go to their doctors and hospitals which Medicare for all does BETTER!  The people DO want Medicare for all it‚Äôs the most popular program in the country right behind social security . Stop trying to run to the center on these issues the people ARE behind us!Lol, the left. You are out of touch. Far left? Medicare for all polling at 70%. I dont know anybody who likes their insurance company.<br /> No cost college tuition polling at 60%<br />Money out of politics polling at 93%. SE your the one who thinks you know better.  Straight corporate-propagandaIs this lady a Republican?&#39;Cause she was on CNN?Wow S.E. CUPP. When did you become such a self righteous bitch? <br />The majority of Americans support these proposals!!!! Go to FOX news, you fucking idiot.is this fox news?God this bitch is fuckin stupid. ITS A PRIMARY YOU DUMB CUNT !!! they‚Äôre not trying to get republican voters in a primary you unbelievable moron. And since when do you care about the majorities ? The majority of Americans also support Medicare for all, they support free college , they support ending the wars, etc etc etc !  By talking about big ideas they ARE appealing to the majority you unbelievable disgusting cunt . Just because you don‚Äôt like healthcare for all people? Doesn‚Äôt mean the majority of the country doesn‚Äôt because they DO. Including a majority of REPUBLICANS !  You have absolutely no idea what you‚Äôre talking aboutThe only thing dumb here is fake news and the dumbocrats that watch and actually believe the garbage this circus broadcasts. Oh and the Mueller report and all the social justice warriors. I guess really the whole left is dumb. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CNNFAKENEWS">#CNNFAKENEWS</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TRUMP2020">#TRUMP2020</a>I disagree with Sara ElizabethThe 2020 election should be dealing with racism, because we have a race problem in this countrySend illegals back no freeloadersSo many triggered DNC shills in the comments section üòÇüòÇBold! I love it. Keep speaking truths! We dems need to be tolerant of different ideas.but here&#39;s the thing, the reset button involves very ugly non politically correct language. I&#39;m a homeless man and people after watching my videos about my camp have called me Rich which is pretty laughable.  they claim that my Camp is so good because I allegedly have so much money, but the reality is if you look at the same tents and camping equipment on Skid Row in Los Angeles and other places you will learn that my camping equipment isn&#39;t any different than what they have.  <br /><br />WHAT&#39;S  DIFFERENT  IS HOW  I  TAKE  CARE OF  MY HOME!!!  it might only be a tent in the woods with a few baubles here and there but I perform very basic maintenance starting with putting my trash in a dumpster and not letting it pile up. you hear a lot of poor communities complaining that they don&#39;t have everything that they need. I&#39;m not saying this isn&#39;t true, but I also know that a lot of urban black neighborhoods have become so feral and out of control that the corporate white man stopped being their worst enemy a long time ago.<br /><br />South  American  countries  are so bad because  South Americans made them that way. and urban black communities help to turn their neighborhoods into the shit hole that it is today.  I  told  you  that  the  truth  wouldn&#39;t  be  pretty.This was way out there, even for her.<br />Why is she talking about appealing to former Trump voters at this stage in the process?  It doesn&#39;t make any sense to appeal to them now, you have to win the primary first... And former Trump voters do no vote in the goddamn primary!  She can think what she wants and bait all she wants, but I&#39;m really disappointed in Van Jones for not calling her on her bullshit! What a coward! <br /> Well, young lady, I don&#39;t recommend you try to pull that shit with Anderson Cooper, or Chris Cuomo, they will not let you off that easily.<b>*Lindsey Graham stated about the same.... Why do Republicans, want Biden!?*</b><br />Democrats are saying &quot;things still suck and I know everyday Americans are struggling&quot;. And you know how obviously that is true.... The government shut down, Middle class workers needed handouts when they missed a single paycheck. Americans are struggling. And you are wrong SECupp, if you think things are going great.Please run for president CuppFuck this Republican cunt.She is incredibly beautiful. SE CUPP.The CNN cunt at it again.SE Cupp is FOX SCUM, go away!Are the liberals purposely trying to loose the election?If the Democrats lost to Donald Trump because their policies actually wanted to look after Americans with health care and education and action on climate change.....then it won&#39;t be the Democrats who failed.....It will be America who failed. Though that would just be one more downward trend-dot for a country that was numb enough between the ears to elect a grifter like Trump.Well people... she&#39;s right!<br />If the Demoncrats want to beat president Trump in the 2020 elections...they have to change their strategy. They are not doing well at this point in time.<br /><br />Trump won this debate, and he was not even in it!<br /><br />The Leftist Liberal Demoncrats are losing big time. None of them will beat Trump with their current strategy!<br /><br />The Demoncrats will not make America Great for the American Citizens trying to help the none citizens.<br /><br />The Demoncrats cannot continue to count on none citizens, and even dead people to vote for them.<br /><br />Judicial Watch is on to them after it is was reveal by the Wiki Leak drops that the Demoncrats have been cheating at election time that for decades!<br /><br />Not good!The Democrat clown car.Secupp is so wrightThis is the so called &quot;liberal media&quot;  Progressive policies are supported by the majority of voters. That includes democrats, independents and republicans.  You are a status quo  corporate hack and you are purposely misinforming your audience.whos the next assclown for president, pee wee herman ?OK. 1. As others have pointed out, Hillary was a centrist. It would seem that running another corporate centrist, like Biden or Harris, is &quot;a dumb idea.&quot;  2. Medicare 4 All is not &quot;only popular w a small section&quot; of Democratic voters, since it is very popular with both parties(almost 70% of all voters polled want Medicare 4 All.) 3. Why didn&#39;t SE explain the reason Healthcare for all immigrants is being suggested, like Van did, instead of just panning it? 4. Was it SE&#39;s turn to shill for CNN&#39;s corporate sponsors? Or does she really buy the talking points?The only people who want to keep their insurance is the people with privilege and money. Duh that‚Äôs why they vote Biden. Because even with trump their daily lives don‚Äôt change. All they want is someone who isn‚Äôt crazy inside the White House. But what real Americans want is healthcare, good paying jobs, clean air and water, civil rights, etc.You&#39;re a really dumb person if you think you can reach trump voters, ms cupp, they know who he is, they know what he does, they LOVE him for it. You can&#39;t reach them. The dems are &quot;one-upping&quot; each other on HOW they&#39;re going to solve problems for the 75% of america that can be reached. Moron.I think you&#39;re wrong!<br />he&#39;s an idiot<br />You can&#39;t defend himFu  ck  Trader TrumpShe‚Äôs either stupid or just being a corporate shill I bet it‚Äôs bothTrump is really having trouble with his words. &quot;Portended&quot;  it to be? I sounded as if  he meant  portrayed it. It had already happened when he commented  on it.Maybe SE Cup should run.  Though to just not vote for her would leave me very unsatisfied.<br /><br /><br />Moron: to vote for is the same thing as voting not for the other ... fucking moron.  If CNN only had a brain.<br /><br /><br />Do you realize that you insult with shit like this?You&#39;re right. We should just dox 15 year olds insteadWhen did SE become the member of a women&#39;s bobsled team?This klutz describes the G20 as &#39;gladhanding with dictators&#39;. How edgy. CNN is fake news.CIRCUS ZOO CNNSE Cupp, you are a liar! Nobody talked about giving FREE healthcare to &quot;Illegals&quot;, Medicare for all will not be free, any Senior Citizen will tell you that Medicare isn&#39;t free. Your kind like to bash the White House Occupant for his lies and indecency but you aren&#39;t any different when the rubber meet the road. Shame on you!This dumb lady thinks she can have her own opinion lolAll she did was trash the Democrats. I don&#39;t mind hearing from either parties because I&#39;m open minded but she didn&#39;t say one good thing about the debates. If it was the other way around and mostly Republicans and they made some good points I would agree even if I&#39;m with the left so I don&#39;t understand why the right always gotta be hateful looking to clash? LmaoC&#39;mon folks give the lady a break! She is trying to make a dollar and carve out a niche for herself! She is not taking principle to the supermarket, it won&#39;t get you anything! We know where she was trained and what she thinks! Why because she tells us every time she speaks! She is really a female Greg Gutfeld except way smarter! She is going to be there, as long as she can generate ratings or until something better comes along. Kinda like Meghan &#39;John is my dad&#39; McCain!She looks bigger than a S.E. Cupp.Awesome stuff SE Cupp!  üá®üá¶üòäWhen the people are wrong and being stupid, it&#39;s the job of a REAL leader to tell them the real facts.

Anyone who does that is a blind man leading the fools.So dumb yuck!F U  s e cupp u t bagger whore <br />YES SHE SHOULD GO TO FOXHoly shit. For a moment there I thought I was watching Fox news. I knew CNN was bad, but this bad? Backing Biden Bad?KKK Antifa what`s the difference?

What the fuck cnnWhat about the strategy for CNN to continue to create fake news? If you&#39;re  having trouble answering the question take a look at CNN ratings. The Home gardening network is doing better... Reruns of  Gilligan Island have better ratings.Sorry Van but the leftists social movements are actually manufactured. Not like the manufactured border crisis. I drive down the street and see Trump signs 6 feet high, painted and built with wood. It took a person to put manual labor of hours and hours just to make a sign. That energy is across the country and the world, no matter how much propaganda cnn and other totalitarian media outlets spew to leftist lemmings. This movement won&#39;t be stopped. It&#39;s already happened in Europe as well. Leftist are so uninformed. They probably have no clue almost ALL of Europe ran very fast from the left. Americans are just a bit behind but more are waking up by the minute.Enjoy Trump in 2020!!!!    LMAOi think i might agree with cnn for onceTRUMP DOESN&#39;T MAKE ANY SENSE WHEN HE SPEAKS.

Regardless, she&#39;s a corporate shill, no better than a Fox anchor.To the people saying she should leave and/or go to fox just because she has a different view to you,it goes to show your lack of tolerance and willingness to listen to opposing views believing your always right,that they must be shut down.Welcome to the inclusive left!If you think employers are going to keep covering their employees under every ones Medicare plan except Sanders and Warren, then you&#39;ve got another thing coming. It&#39;s similar to why we&#39;re in this mess, we&#39;ve left too many options for these companies to take advantage of it&#39;s consumers.Wow, I don&#39;t see &quot;eye to eye&quot; on most CNN videos, but at least SE Cupp (no disrespect) has more courage then most CNN anchors to speak the truth.<br />Huh, it&#39;s good to see that not all democrats are brain dead.They`re all morons that`s what they had in common.SE CuntShe gained like 5 lbs this week??

Good job!.Medicare is not a healthcare option, it&#39;s an insurance option neither one has any health benefits over the other except one is full coverage, no deductibles or copays, no exploding premiums and would be available to everyone.<br /><br />Medicare is excepted at 95% of doctors and all hospitals across the US so crossing state lines isn&#39;t an issue.<br />The same cannot be said for private insurance.<br /><br />I do wish the media had unbiased reporting on that topic as opposed to pandering to their advertisers in the drug and insurance business.<br /><br />You know what you don&#39;t see in Canada, endless prescription drug and health insurance commercials.<br />No need too because I don&#39;t get to bother my doctor with my random layman drug picks, he prescribes what is needed and he also isn&#39;t bogged down with querying a multitude of insurance companies trying to find out what procedure they&#39;ll cover.<br /><br />In and out and no monetary pain coming your way down the road.<br /><br />Not sure what the hang up is over keeping a for profit insurance company, unless you like paying 30 -40% in profits to them for the coverage you&#39;re afraid to use because of the deductibles and copays.go on SE it&#39;s time to sign your republican cardShe does make some valid points regardless of what all you on here say...It&#39;s about WINNING an election, not tryin to be all things to all people, some compromise is gonna have to happen to win.

While the rest of the world waits at least 5 years and need to prove they will Not get free welfare. Is there a Democratic candidate out there who represents common sense immigration? Democrats are right on everything except immigrantion. This is why Trump won in 2016It&#39;s a Democratic primary debate. They debate democratic talking points. Republicans don&#39;t try to win over Democrats in their primaries. They&#39;re winning back their base. And the majority of people DID vote with Democrats! That&#39;s why we blue waved them in!Kamala said she was a victim of segregation in San Francisco California in 1970 .BRAVO!!! Best commentary I have seen from CNN in years.  Good point to warn people that the democrats are going to get stomped by a landslide (aka, McGovern v Nixon). That warning helps get them prepared for all the crying they will be doing in November, 2020.

Really? You guys are gonna crash it until you‚Äôre dead üíÄ üòÜS.E. Cupp is just another Republican Never Trumper trying to tell the Democrats how to run their primary. These Never Trumpers are not arguing in good faith. They may hate the president, but they support most of his right-wing policies. And Van Jones has turned out to be such a disappointment. George McGovern was considered kooky because he opposed the Vietnam war and supported gay rights. That says more about the power of brainwashing than about McGovern. The country is more progressive now and has better access to information. The average American is to the left of the average Democrat in Washington.U re on the wrong channel. Btw her stylist should be fired. What‚Äôs with that gym sweater ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èCNN&#39;s token Fox surrogate.SE Cupp is a conservative. I don&#39;t give a shit what she thinks about Democrats for 2020.Hey those voters aren‚Äôt going to help any of them win the their parties nomination! They go after those voters after the one year parts nomination silly.This bimbo is wrong!What a corporate Pig she is.CNN constant actions to pitch for the corporations candidatesNice titsSE double D! are you running for Magan McCain wow you are up, your 1% echo chamber ass!CNN = Cunts News NetworkMayor Pete - Medicare for all who want itYou are right this is like watching foxski and friendski.Shut up Semen Cup.Harris will eat Trumps lunchMedicare for all means just that. Van Jones has it wrong.  If you can opt out then it&#39;s not medicare for all.  Lets say that you have insurance and your insurance doesn&#39;t cover your disease. So then do you come begging to the universal coverage when you didn&#39;t pay into the system? Medicare for all is essentially an umbrella insurance program for everyone. It works because everyone pays into it and everyone is covered. It&#39;s a not for profit insurance program and that&#39;s why it&#39;s less costly. If you want extra insurance for exclusive private treatment, that&#39;s fine but you still have to pay into the umbrella insurance policy that covers everyone.Look at those beautiful titsWhat is she talking about? Another Meghan McCain here. When we watching republicans on their debates last year, did she ask them why none of them talked about us? That‚Äôs stupid. These are primaries.No, S.E. , because those voters whom you describe are actually Republicans, like you, and are the bane of our common existence. We don&#39;t need a preponderance of ultra-conservative members in the Democratic party. Please stop advocating for conservative principles in a progressive party. Go dirty the waters with your own kind: the heartless, greedy, Tory, Republicans. When will CNN pull the plug on you and your wildly right-tilted commentary?you won&#39;t be with cnn very much longerGet use to it 4 more years Donald J Trump,and reclaim his 2 years that were stolen by HRC and her gang of instigations !20 candidates that donde homework the past the present and the future but this is going to be a difficult of a challenge data which size going to be that the one on the left or the one in the right because this isn&#39;t make sure that everyone want to have a chance of what they keep their promises 20 candidates that he or she could be of a to be responsibility from United States of America the people citizens in different language but only time I&#39;m going to tell that a who&#39;s going to be responsibility for the future by the year of 2020 because many people well say don&#39;t they homework a long time ago and today right now you already know who that is but this is only for the American people sentences that they&#39;re going to make their own decision that by the year 2020 it&#39;s your choiceThe Democratic Candidate debates if anything are dividing Democratic voters and/or pissing them off. Hell the only thing Trump has to do to win if they keep this up is to let these clowns talk without a filterWow, she‚Äôs fucking dumbhey but um...they are wrongJust when you think they cannot go further left, these candidates enter the realm of lunacyLook at Joe Biden history. He wanted to abolish social security and Medicare and Medicaid. He&#39;s more of a republican.

However, if Govt. is RESPONSIBLE for particular problems (and that entails a long list), then policies within our Govt.

Our document (of which we&#39;re so proud) reads: We, The PEOPLE...not WE, in The Congress...not WE, in The White House...and certainly not WE, who own the huge corporations. <br /><br />The people who work in our Govt. are our SERVANTS...Not the other way around. If I was wealthy enough to have my own personal servant, and this servant took MY money, and gave it away to a few billionaires (who didn&#39;t even need it), they sure as hell wouldn&#39;t be my servant much longer.

Hey, lady, you‚Äôre by yourself up there‚Äîwhy are you shouting? The moderators at NBC asked very leading questions. In the context of universal medical coverage, undocumented immigrants were included. Misleading to suggest candidates would offer illegal immigrants medical care without care for all. Undocumented immigrants typically work, pay taxes, pay social security. A healthy population doesn‚Äôt benefit by leaving disease untreated in some. Over-all, a C- on your report. Next time use reasoned arguments based on what the candidates actually say. Nice, unbiased photos on display behind you, btw.

The state takes 10 percent.

How sad üò¢ for America in this time.Trump is absurd, even for a clown.Andrew yang is teaching out to the people you refer to.The problem with the primary process is that it skews too far to the extremes in both parties.

Unbelievable!bitch are ya white? what are you doing helping trump win again? are you crazy?SE Cupp knows dumb when she sees it, after she is an unabashed supporter of Trump, fortunately, Van Jones put up a reasonable defence of the Democratic position.If only there was some way we could know how a neo liberal centrist would do against Trump.Wtf is this lady talking about. So everything is great in our country?For once I agree with S.E cupp. After what I saw in the last two debates, i can no longer support the Democratic Party. I‚Äôd rather have 4 more years of trump then to have one of these leftest lunatics as president. If the Democratic Party cannot reach out to moderates you might as well give the election to trump. The Democratic Party has become the party of elites, the rich, and the highly educated and the snobbish attitude just turns people off. As a white working class male I despise the Democratic Party  and if the democrats kick all the moderates to the curb you know what all those moderates are going to do? Those moderates like me are going to vote for trump. I get sick of the elitist attitude that the democrats have. I simply cannot vote for the agenda that the Democrats are pitching. The Democratic Party is out of touch with mainstream America. Their so busy tending to people who come into this country illegally then tending to the problems of US CITIZENS WHO BY THE WAY VOTE YOU INTO OFFICE!!  As an independent I am disgusted by the attitude of the Democratic Party. I mean if this is the best that the democrats can offer then may god help us all.This is why I dont take anything CNN says seriously. If Fox news and CNN say the same thing, its almost always worng.Repubs are a lost cause, the immoral, unethical, racist, fake patriotic, fuck the country, fuck the environment and i dont care if im a scumbag attitude makes real Americans sickYou&#39;re wrong Cupp. People don&#39;t like their health insurance. They like the care they get from their Drs. Stop misleading people.Yo yo yo <br />Get behind Bernie! Yo yo yo! The earth is going to shake humanity off like fleas if Americans don&#39;t help with Carbon emissions......CO2 is a problem for everybody!! Sincerely, good luck! P.S.

Cupp keeps saying that Democrats are supposed to suck up to Trump voters when she never ever says neither Trump nor his angry hoard of voters do anything whatsoever to genuinely do the same to Democrats. F**k that bull s**tIf candidates are &quot;out-lefting&quot; each other it means that Bernie is still a threat to both corporate Democrats AND the corporate media.  Even if he loses the primary, he&#39;s still won, same as last time.Fuck Corporate Joe Biden!!! He&#39;s a worse candidate than Hillary Clinton. Horrible voting record, bends over for his donors and doesn&#39;t do shit for the working people of this countrySpeaking od the Dumbest strategies, this 30 something (maybe40) conservative news comentator, has to understand it&#39;s still early.  This is just the begining and with 23 candidates, the world hasn&#39;t to time to hear all that needs fixing in one fell swoop. Be patient young lady, you sound like a dissapointed child.Quite the interesting take. By interesting I mean privileged due to the fact that millions of Americans are struggling unnecessarily due to corporate greed and corruption. These fat cats already have more money than is possible to spend, including media commentators/reporters like SE Cupp. Hmm.. Why be such a bastard about policies that&#39;ll help the masses that aren&#39;t so fortunate? Perhaps to trigger people and make ad revenue? Hmm.... We have enough money for unilateral and unjust wars and tax cuts for the rich but not enough to help our general population? Oh America....Hahahaha fake news CNNüòÇI was really rooting for Biden, but now I believe he&#39;s past his time and may have been a Great thing. We need to move on from the 6 year old to maybe that 12 year old who told those children they are the future generation.!.The WHOLE point of a Democratic primary is to appeal to Democratic voters! So they did pretty good in my book.  You sick.None of these Democratic party politicians are saying anything to African Americans voters. Not one policy they&#39;re speaking of is directed to issues affecting the African American community. <br />Just listen to them. No debate about us. Just the dreamers and the illegals coming across the border.

The reason that Hillary Clinton lost is because she was too centrist and establishment.  People are starting to wake up and are fed up with the status quo.  Trump got elected because he wasn&#39;t another establishment hack.  Too bad he was a conman that constantly lies.  Just imagine a person with a populist message that actually had intentions on helping people, telling the truth, and a plan.  We have people like that all ready.

I use my card at the pharmacy and don&#39;t have to pay anything.<br />My son&#39;s epipens are fully covered too by the way.<br />I also have a compulsery complementary private insurance, half of it paid by my employer. It mostly covers dental, glasses, and the occasional &quot;comfort drugs&quot; which are not already fully reimbursed by Social Security. Incidentally, these insurance companies are doing great financially.<br />There is a reason why EVERY SINGLE developped country in the world has a similar system: it is cheaper and provides better coverage.You don&#39;t even understand the issues, you&#39;ve been eating far too much corporate cheese, you fascist, fucking bitch!Cupp.... you are an idiot. Clearly that&#39;s not what they said. The economy is doing well, but nobody is feeling that but the Uber rich. They were saying the Wall Street numbers are not reaching &quot;our&quot; kitchen table&quot; . A point you missed, possibly because it would ruin signature piece. I could list most of your missed points, but you get the idea.Trump is scared shitless of going up against Biden.Here come the Nasty Women commentsSE cupp is wrong.Disagree with Van Jones on healthcare. Private insurance companies would take the healthiest ppl and leave something like a Medicare for those who need it less effective. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MedicareforAll">#MedicareforAll</a>Trump is not the best person to judge who did what...he&#39;s a barely literate moron who got into office off the timing of an investigation announcement  that wasn&#39;t. This is the first debate and obviously not all topics could be elaborated on...Sapp is an idiot.Ok bye girl!I see straight through your bull shit baby girl. You are the wrong one.!‚ÄúHas to be one of the dumbest strategies...‚Äù says the privileged girl who knows jack about regular Americans or economics. Girl, bye. üëãVan Jones you are wrong.<br />Biden is a worse choice than Hillary.<br />I will vote Dem but not pre established Biden.<br />Do you even remember 2016 with pre established Hillary?Pitching ideas under the pretext that voters arent stupid is obsurd! Voters think the economy is good because of stock market and low unemployment. None bother to ask what kind jobs are being counted, fulltime vs parttime, or how a great stock market helps the middle class.  Voters are like dogs with low attention spans...  squirrels!!!  Can we trust voters to do whats better for the entire country when whites feel their power being threatened and willing to do anything to keep, even if they have to take away the rights of others who are not white (Blacks, Hispanics and Native americans). If this isnt clear yet, ask a trump supporter what policy did he put forward in 2016, or even for 2020. Ask a trump voter how the tax cuts helped them. Ask a trump voters what regulations that have been rolled back, have helped them. Also ask which rolled back regulations have hurt them. Ask a trump supporter why arent employers hiring illegal aliens being penalized while the wall is being built and the migrants being blocked at the border. Ask a trump voter why is it ok for trump to hire illegal aliens disregarding americans for those jobs. Ask a trump voter why we have spent over $100 million of our taxes so trump can play gulf.               <br />These people are delusional hypocrites and can not be trusted to guide this country. They have made their choices and if they cant come to their senses then they shouldnt be paid attention to in the next election. <br /><br />Study your facts people and read a book once in a while!What the hell does too far left look like? I get sick of hearing a term that doesn&#39;t exist. We already have an extreme right wing white supremacist in the white house and what we have you fear is tuition free college? Health care for everyone? Adorable housing? A living wage? Green new deal which mean high paying technology jobs? Electric vehicles and mass transit? Legalizing human beings that cross our borders? That&#39;s far left? Really? That&#39;s what far left looks like? I&#39;ll take that over a pathological liar, racist, rapist, sexual predator any day of the week who belongs in prison rather than air force one.She is so partisan its ridiculous! She can rant on and on about what the Democrats are doing but currently, Republicans are corrupt to the core...which she continues to support...This is one of the dumbest strategies I&#39;ve seen, CNN.The &quot;far left&quot; candidatesbyou speak of are finally voicing what most of Americans believes in. Terrible opinion piece as usual imo&quot;portended&quot; it to be?!? Did he mean &quot;portray (depict)&quot;?Dear t.v talking head with a pretty face: 150M Americans can not afford a $1000 medical emergency. We need REAL change.Portended?  speak ENGLISH Mr.President!Democrats will get further by NOT fellating stupid jerkoffs like SE CuppSorry none of the candidates that would win are paid forWhatTankyouüëçnoSE you have been constantly wrong in what you say. You are outta touch with what the majority of Americans. All of these issues are polling very hi. Get your facts straight. It is the Majority of America that is sick of the wealth gap, not having access to good healthcare, <br />$15 minimum wage, taxing the rich these are all polling over 60% and some 70% in this country on both sides of the isle. Get with the heart beat of Americans and stop being a Corporate hack.Who Give a Good FK !DEMOCRATS = TREASONShe‚Äôs right.TDS much?Cupp is the sexiest news woman of all timeSE Cupp stinks on ice, and moderates are what kills this country&#39;s soulGee, Cupp, perhaps you should work on fixing your shitty party that people like you have ruined. We progressives outnumber you. We aren&#39;t begging for votes from never Trumpers who already ruined their party and now want to ruin the Dem party.<br />We already pay for healthcare for the undocumented and we pay more because these people wait till they are on death&#39;s door before getting medical attention.<br />We aren&#39;t compromising on women&#39;s autonomy, we aren&#39;t compromising on healthcare for all. <br />These people like SE Cupp are insufferable. They have to make a choice. Since they ruined their party and are to blame for Trump then too fucking bad, you get a liberal to set things right. <br />No more capitulation to the rabid right wing.CNN SucksDaily reminder that CNN is fake newsI do not care what that unpresidential man thinks. All I know is I will not vote for his sorry ass. I am tired of the media giving him attention.SE Cupp is a man.üòíüòíüòíüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑVan, as for school and emergency services for the undocumented, don&#39;t let the world know just how ignorant you are.<br />They contribute to the economy far more than anything they receive.<br />There are billions in S.S. funds which they can&#39;t retrieve because of their legal status.<br />All of them contribute to property taxes directly or indirectly.<br />All of them contribute as consumers.<br />To think I thought you were an intelligent person. <br />You&#39;re a damned fool or a hateful creep!Is gov&#39;t the &quot;cure-all&quot; for &quot;every problem&quot;? No. But gov&#39;t can solve many current problems and forestall others entirely. We can&#39;t just do everything alone. And didn&#39;t SE Cupp once say that politics, at the end of the day, is about &quot;solving problems&quot;?You are so right Sarah.  There&#39;s no need to embrace Trump&#39;s positions to win over the skeptical center, we just need candidates who are less polarizing.  Trump&#39;s election was a (largely white) reaction to tribal politics, and we certainly don&#39;t need more of that.  We need unity.this is why cnn sucks.....People want and like paying for health insurance??? Here in Canada we pay higher taxes but it would be nowhere near the cost of private insurance.This retarted bobble-headed bitch!! What the fuck are you talking about? Their represented Democrats, not republicans stupid!! You show me one damn republican trying to appeal to democrat voters dummy!! And is this faux news disguised as CNN? I think I just got click baited!!!Talk to the retired people that has to work for Co Pay at 65+Trump with an opinion on a debate.  What a joke. His idea of a good debate is name calling and belittling. Why is trump given free air time to talk down one of his opponents?  Make him pay.All of the &quot;candidates&quot; were saying the same thing. There is no democrat debate. This is a contest to see who&#39;s asss is a perfect fit for a donor&#39;s hand to move their mouth.Only 10 percent of Americans in the United States support Conservative Ideologies and Policies which is why they are niche and while 90 percent of Americans support Liberal Ideologies and Policies which is why they are mainstream. Because of those facts I&#39;m voting Democrat in 2020!If everyone had Medicare, things would be better because the medical establishment and the pharmaceutical industry would not be able to manipulate prices as easily.<br />As well, insurance companies would stop raking in so much money from healthy insured people covered through their employers.Raise your hand if your plan would include healthcare to illegal immigrants...!!!<br />Democrats are out of their freaking mind..Why can&#39;t Republicans like SE Cupp focus on the happenings of their own party? And who is to say that Democrats aren&#39;t doing some outreach to disaffected Trump voters? Bernie gets plenty of Republican votes in Vermont. Remember that many people voted for Trump because they were afraid of/had misgivings about Hillary.So is this CNN‚Äôs attempt to support the establishment?Am i watching fox news right now? I can&#39;t tell.Anyone who votes or supports any of these BAT SHIT CRAZY idiot&#39;s you get what you deserve another 4 more years of the greatest presidents in decades! TRUMP PENCE 2020 K. A. G.Democrats brains are exploding right now....Hahahahaha<br />They candidates are running so far left, they left low earth orbit<br />And will over take Elon musk little red car in no timeFuck CuppSE Cupp looks like a big hefty woman. She sure sounds Repugnant Rethuglikkkan &amp; would be right at home on Fox Entertainment Faux News!I stopped at 3.17. I&#39;ve never heard this lady before, but she seems to have no clue what&#39;s happening in real life, in the trenches and across the board. Just my two cents... first time tuning into CNN. I&#39;m not a fan of opinionists... I tend to need court docs, facts with very little opinion.Dems already own all the left (anyone but trump) vote and Republicans own the right. The battle is for the center and I agree with SE that dems are not playing for those people. Keep it up and you‚Äôll be looking at 4 more years of this nonsense.corporate media won&#39;t let go.Just to let you know se cupp is a republican.A white person isn‚Äôt gonna respond well to racial issues period. Biden did the best he was gonna do. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èNow that the Supreme Court has passed on the issue of gerrymandering, and Mitch McConnell is blocking voter protection from foreign influence into American elections and scoffed at the idea that Americans should be free to vote on a holiday.  There is evidence that Republicans wanted to add the question of citizenship to the census in order to suppress the African American and Latino votes.  Trump is inviting Putin‚Äôs interference into our elections again.  Maybe Democrats should add Patriotism to their message.Your being overtly cynical. They arent running to the Middle!! You run to the middle in the General. No one cares about Trump voters..Because they never cared about anyone else. But those Moderates lost their say so because of Hillary. Now they have a choice..Get on the Left or vote for Trump. Independents like Bernie so they will go with the Left anyway.Damn SE CUPP! Thank you I would get at youPoor SE CUPP. She is on the next CNN layoff round and she cant suck dick to keep her job because they are all fags over there. Van Jones...I rest my case.CNN is Fake News. Democrats ALWAYS try to pander and BUY the vote.SE Cupp, Libertarian Loon, Call yourself Sarah Elizabeth you smug muppet! You&#39;re not a bloody children&#39;s book authorThe idiot! Who are all those people out there who wouldn&#39;t want Medicare For All?  <br />Like all those seniors today who don&#39;t want Medicare? <br />All those people (and their employers) who would rather pay extortionate middleman fees to private insurance companies? <br />All those people who lack coverage because they&#39;re unemployed or have lousy jobs? <br />All those people who have insurance with huge deductibles and unforeseen gaps?Wow, the tits on that woman are amazing!Hey SE Cup...the majority of Americans want all those progressive policies.<br /><br />And the GOP hasn&#39;t worked with Dems. I mean they totally fell back for 8 years<br />just because the President was Black....like Really?<br /><br />CNN doesn&#39;t want progressive policies, of course. And it&#39;s THIER Network.<br /><br />So I don&#39;t expect them to be honest about what the PEOPLE of this country want.<br /><br />I absolutely despise Donald Trump, <br />but he knows how the mainstream media have fucked over the masses.<br /><br />THIER are plenty of examples where ANYONE abreast of issues,<br />Can spot obvious bias,<br />Or support for something,<br /><br />That is solely intended to satisfy the interest of some CORPORATE group....at  GREAT expense to the American People.<br /><br />Fake news is real, this is just another example.I wonder if Foxnews or any thig right wing radio talk shows would give a progressive person their own shows??????? hmmmmm me thinks not, this is why to me liberals and progessive and the adults in the room. Foxnews would NEVER EVER EVER allow anyone with independent thinking on their air, but we dems have to sit here and listen to this privileged woman  who has a Super easy life. Now tell us about who to vote for. SMHCupp is complaining about crazy left ideas meanwhile we have an actual crazy person in the whitehouse?Donald is king of ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what your talking about.‚Äù üôÑshe is dumb.Don&#39;t listen to Cupp, she&#39;s a straight up Republican. Keep removing my comment and the next time I will post it 100 times.What&#39;s strange is you don&#39;t think your paying for everyone now there was stupid by the way with your blue Pepsi butt holes you all owe 60,000 have a real world think And stop breeding pig&#39;s you stupid and needüò© such a humanity case .And tell us why Republicans do NOTHING for anyone except White racist?I cant vote Democrat anymore. They only care about illegals at this point. Why is the left giving out health care to illegals and speaking Spanish.the left has never mattered to the right. fuck the right and SE cup. all that bitching trying to keep up with status quo. didnt no one ask for her dumb ass advice lmaoPoor @cnn whining their corporate candidate didn&#39;t do well.And it‚Äôs also quite disappointing that Van Jones decided come on and compare something like health insurance and health care to public transportation. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èPolitical correctness and identity politics will ruin the democrats, mark my words.Trump trolls libtards so hard and they fall for it every single time because all they care about is virtue signaling and identity politics. The Trump forever meme is an example. The debates showed me Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than American citizens. Winning strategy for reals!How awful it would be if America took care of their sick, fed the poor, and treated strangers like family.  Like Jesus did...Why should they try and reach out to trump voters? Fuck those people. They can all eat a bag of dicks. They all voted for trump knowing he&#39;s a shitstain and knowing full goddamn well he&#39;s a lying, racist, asshole.Nice CNN looks like you&#39;re finally figuring out it&#39;s a class war. Nobody&#39;s buying your crap.Forget it CNN. Cut your losses, enjoy Trump 2020 and regroup later.Why does she run her show like bill o Reillydumb even if it is true?The Kiersten gillibrand of journalistsFuck off SEThis really sounds like a Bill O‚ÄôReilly segment.Sir, I hope for the first time in your life that a Black Woman will whip your A**. That will be Historical. Looking forward to the final outcome.Honestly I think Biden was caught waaaay off guard.  This infighting is not constructiveThought I was watching Faux NewsListening to a man that is the worst at debating criticize others in a debate is laughable. He sucks so bad at it that he backed out of as many as he possibly could.<br />Oh and If you think the progressive Dems should be pandering to the rich corporate voters I want to know where are you when the corporate Dems ignore the poor, the environment and the discriminated? We finally have candidates that are speaking to the forgotten and the centrists are getting a taste of their own medicine. We&#39;re tired of our problems being the ones that are the after thoughts. Its about time our voices are heard. The rich have increased their ownership of the wealth by 21 trillion while the bottom 50% have lost 800 billion. Those numbers are shocking and if they aren&#39;t slowed down the next 30 years could become violent.Biden proved he can&#39;t take down the President... it&#39;s early but seriously?Sippy cup wants an establiahment centrist like clinton who will blow smoke up republican assholes.WTF is a &quot;SE Cupp&quot;?  I&#39;m not being mean, I&#39;m not making a joke, I just truly do not know what a SE Cupp is.  Anyone?  Help please?Wow, you‚Äôre being too obvious now. Thanks for making it abundantly clear you‚Äôre an elitist prick not looking out for the 99%It&#39;s all set up to work for what they really want to do. This is a big distraction &amp; does nothing to hurt or make Chump look bad, even though he has already proven to be a wack job &amp; lier. Stay focus on your potential candidates because any choice is better than picking Republican Chump &amp; friends.Look at the rasist sticking together,( trump defending Biden) nothing wrong with that, so when THE MOST HIGH comes to save his people from the lake of fire, who are BLACKS, HISPANICS, AND THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF THE AMERICAS, we don&#39;t want hear you so-called whites complaining. Read your Bible Its all been foretoldüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇYou can take the S.E. out of Fox but you can&#39;t take the Fox bs out of S.E.&quot;unfettered access&quot; to abortion.  You Bitch.erm... How about , with so many candidates, MSM give them more time...aka a longer show.... don&#39;t put it on them... MSM asked the questions... they had no opportunity to address half of the issues... CNN&#39;s right wing ... Cupp should marry Chuck Todd so they could annoy each other and not us.as always the likes/dislikes ratio is awful because cnn is <b>fake news</b>Gee! CNN is turning it&#39;s self into the Biden booster club.Damage control attempt by Corporatist Elitist Democrats cause Biden sucked dick. Nobody is happy with their health insurance companies ripping them off. Imagine if you had the same doctors and paid less per month for them.S.E. Cupp in Spaaaaaaace!!!I&#39;m currently enjoying some wings from Buffalo WingsImagine listening to republican SE Cupp, who wrote in Paul Ryan as her vote in 2016. Every election cycle it&#39;s the same thing: &quot;Barack Obama is moving the party too far to the left&quot; and before that : &quot;Bill Clinton is moving America towards socialism!&quot;. It&#39;s funny, the only candidate they didn&#39;t accuse of being a socialist was Hillary and SHE LOST.Cupp is a rent a hoe.More like D-DE CuppPresident doesn‚Äôt like women candidatesSe cupp got some mad curvesTPP, Nafta, Bank bailout, War in Iraq, who is boosting up Joe Biden&#39;&#39;s credibility?CNN when are you ever going to report the news I don‚Äôt think I can find any news on your channel all the racist Trump bashing weird really weirdSounds like the perfect strategy to meAs extremely left as you think they might be, each and every one of them proposed to do more for most Americans when compared to what Trump is doing!<br />He screwed the poor and the middle class!<br />He gave almost $2 trillion to the rich and raised our debt by $22 trillion within the next decade. <br />If Democrats help half of the population, which  represents 160 million Americans, then it&#39;s best we elect a Democrat as  President!Who is this chick,  are pigs flying   correct if I&#39;m wrong  CNN are you ok.  CNN is opening their eyes WowJoe Biden is radioactive for the Democratic Party, here&#39;s why  <br />    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDJ19QTP_5c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDJ19QTP_5c</a>I think people just want to get rid of Trump. Biden may not be up to his game at the moment, but he&#39;ll be a far better president than Donald Trump.What about police brutality? I don&#39;t see any Republicans and Democrats who are passing laws to curb the excessive amount of deadly police force towards African Americans.CUPP you forget something...there are a lot of people who voted obama because he ran on change. In a dumbed down version Trump tried the same. Clinton didn`t want to change a thing and lost...biden already tried and lost and he will fail again. And why should the democrats always try to bend over to republicans? You know that democrats are allowed to have strong positions aswell?Except when the government (Trump) is the problem.Hope trump wins again. So many weak Democrats trying bulldoze thinking its ez beat trump. Smh. We need real recessions and real fck up before we change. Give that clown another 4 years it&#39;s great for AmericanSE Crap cry about immigrant children being treated like human beings all you want.If you vote republican you will get nothing,no health care or education nothing but the policies that turned redstates into failed states living on federal aid provided by wealthy blue states&#39;Portended.&#39;....lmao.. Trump got his own words now... :55Candidates don&#39;t need your rightwing advice.What&#39;s the matter can&#39;t handle your old boy creepy uncle got his ass handed to him on a platter?  Yeah, that&#39;s what your bitching about.  You can&#39;t win over Republicans that claim to be moderate.  There will always be a &quot;but&quot; that leads them back to republican.  Sorry blonde, no cares what you think.  I stopped 2 minutes.  I have heard it all before.   So here&#39;s my warning.  You don&#39;t like trump, get use to the idea of a progressive winning. The current Establishment is done.Who else thinks Bcupp should lay off the Big Macs and super DUPER sized fries? She&#39;s getting heavy .. like .. maybe .. really big.A debate is an opportunity to put forward policy options to the American people for us to consider.  If you look at the Democratic campaign as a pyramid, the bottom of the pyramid has the broadest ideas. As the campaigns goes forward I hope the ideas will be honed and refined.Wow...well said.  Trump might actually win againyep  CNN is still garbage. Please interview James O&#39;Keefe!Avanetti  2020<br />Whoopie likes him, you will too.CNN should let SE go to Faux and hire Shepard Smith. Give them a credibility boost. A Voice of reason.BUT WAIT THERE&#39;S MORE free stuff to promise everyone!  I&#39;m holding out for curtain #3, or should I go with the box?

Whatabout American citizens? Are progressives the only one who deserves a candidate who thinks govt is the end all be all?<br /><br />Also SE CUPP: If you think the economy is doing well, democrats say YOURE WRONG!! <br /><br />Ok so health insurance is currently private, if its so great why do people have health-care as a top voter issue? Maybe its too expensive. Ok. If the economy is doing well then why arent citizens able to afford health-care? Youre line of questioning is full of holes SE.<br /><br />AlsoDemocrats haven&#39;t moved that far left.<br />The Republicans went so far right that normal , morality and basic human decency seem extremely left.<br />Republicans are traitors. <br />Fact. <br />They no longer work or even pretend to work for the American people. <br />They are the problem.&quot;We will bury you!&quot; Nikita Khrushchev; &quot;Liberal democracy is over,&quot; Putin. The Soviet Union lasted only 69 years.¬† Khrushchev was 77 years old when he died, having been pushed out of office.¬† Putin is 66 years old. Stalin ruled the former Soviet Union for 25 years when he died at 74. Brezhnev ruled the same failed state for 16 years and died when he was 75. Putin is 66. If he stays in office until 2024, Putin would have held power as Russian president for a total of 20 years. He will be 71. Like his predecessors, Putin will go the way of all flesh--even if he is embalmed like Lenin. Psalm 146:3 Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save.President Trump will win 2020.Those centrists have had the last 4 democratic Presidents so to act like they&#39;re left out is bullshit.

You must win over moderate-left and moderate former Trump supporters. They have started so far left that they provided cannon fodder for Trump and PACs in the form of extremist sound bites. Moving more to the center is nearly impossible. The hand-raising was especially harmful as some seemed reluctant yet caved to onstage pressure (lack of conviction/willingness to go along with others instead of standing on any principles).Why you still have a show is beyond me. Quite honestly the majority of the shit you spout about the democratic candidates sounds like the nonsense out of fox. Not one of the candidates said anything close to what you claim in regards to the public being wrong about the economy, healthcare, or immigration. It‚Äôs people like you that contribute to the fatigue factor that sets in with Democrats by the time an election rolls around.

He&#39;s always laughing and asking dumb ass questions.Republicans can point the finger at the left but say nothing about Trump and the tariffs that hurt small businesses and farmers. Yet Republicans are for small businesses and limited government üôÑHow many more women does Trump have to RAPE before someone cuts off his balls?Trump can only win the presidency through the electoral college. It‚Äôs not mathematically feasible for trump to win the popular vote. trump can only win the electoral college if Putin is once again manipulating a relatively small number of votes in a few traditionally blue states. So naturally trump is sucking up to Putin and Kim and Xi. He WANTS foreign government interference in 2020 to help trump. AGAINTrump walks into a bar in Cork, in Ireland, and asks the barman: &quot;What&#39;s the quickest way to get to Dublin?&quot; &quot;Are you walking or driving?&quot; asks the barman. &quot;Driving,&quot; says Trump. &quot;That&#39;s the quickest way,&quot; says the barman.For a Second I thought I clicked on a Fox video.What‚Äôs the difference between a pickpocket and Trump? <br />A pickpocket snatches watches.Trump won already.

They just want all the benefits of being American without any of its obligations.Trump should like dogs:<br />you don&#39;t have to pay <br />to see them pee.Dumbest POTUS in the US political history.Dumbest strategy is to brag about election meddling using manipulated algorithms, media blackouts, censorship, and deplatforming and pretend &quot;Russian&quot; Facebook ads are what cost Hillary the election. Her being unelectable made her lose the elections, Russia didn&#39;t do shit.3 million more people voted for Hillary Clinton. The democratic party will be fine. Trust and believe thatTrump thinks everyone is doing a bad job except for him he knows how to do everything right to hear him say it, which is the biggest lie in the United States of America. He is taking this country for everything it&#39;s worth. Trump&#39;s a loser and has always been a loser and will never be nothing but that, dictatorCupp is out of tune with reality. The Democratic Party leans left now, because most of America leans left. Most Americans are against war and billionaire oligarchs. Most Americans are for affordable medicine and education.Trump is saying he did something no other President could have done.<br />Trump is unscrewing all the light bulbs Obama screwed in.Those who call themselves liberals hate America and all it stands for.
