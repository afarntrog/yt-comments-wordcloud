I send you all my love from France.Rip man, rip...This disgusts meI feel sorry for you, I wish My family would&#39;ve never went to my grandma&#39;s funeral. We did. On that same EXACT night of my First grandma&#39;s funeral, My dad&#39;s step mom, Robin, died that SAME night... You are very fourtunate.  My family, However, never got over the fact that we had to pay DOUBLE the amount of how much a normal funeral costs. And I had to suffer the loss of my best friend. Robin. She taught me how to NOT burn My family&#39;s dinner, and she promised to teach me how to Barbeque. And not to burn THAT. We all have things going on in our lives and we just have to learn there is ALWAYS a bright side to things. God Bless You. &lt;3i’m thinking that he is about to end his youtube channel like....24mil actuallyThis has been such a bad month for everyone I know. It seems every time I talk to someone, someone they know has died. So to the families mark has mentioned I wish you the best of wishes god bless.

Someone give him a hug. Sending him big love. ❤😔RIP Cindy &lt;3Press F to pay respects.There doesn&#39;t have to be a happy ending to every video Mark. It&#39;s okay to just have these ones, because they&#39;re real. Not everything is happy go lucky, and that&#39;s okay. As long as we keep pushing for better, keep pushing to help others. Everyone needs a hand, everyone needs help, even if they don&#39;t want to admit it, so it&#39;s okay to not have a happy ending. Don&#39;t worry about such trivial things, Mark, the happy ending of a video isn&#39;t a massive concern. I hope Tyler will be okay, I hope he knows he isn&#39;t alone.#1 on trending. That’s crazy.We love you Tyler thank you for your mums blessings to you and everyoneTell him sorry for you loss❤❤❤I&#39;m confused about how there is 4.7k dislikes. But on the other note, Tyler, always remember that Cindy will be watching over you &amp; that she is in a better place now.FYou got a good heart, MarkI love the fact this got number 1 on trending so more people can come and help outNo ads, and only links to support them in the description.  Massive support.RIP JORGEN :(I&#39;m sorry for your loss TylerDone and done! <br />I wish the best for both Jay&#39;s and Tyler&#39;s family! I also hope that what little comfort we can provide will help at this difficult time.She was such a strong fighter I send love to her and Tyler.💞🙏💓Rip Cindy and Jay 😔💕💞💕💞Roses are red<br />Violets are PURPLE<br />Rip Jay<br />And Rip Tyler’s Mom 💖💖💖💖💖💖because that&#39;s what heroes doI&#39;m sending all my love to both families. &lt;3Thinking of them and sending lots of love &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br />RIP Tyler&#39;s mom and Jay, the lovely peopleMy condolences to BOTH of you. I also know what it’s like to lose a parent and I’ll be brutally honest, it doesn’t get easier. The pain may subside over time but it still hurts so fucking much no matter how much time passes. But with good vibes from friends and family and even us strangers everything will be okay in the end. Tyler, you’re stronger than you feel right now and I am so sorry you have to go through this. Sending you both all my love and good vibes &lt;3Awwwwwww. This is so sad cause Tyler is the type of person who you would expect to have a great caring mom.

We don’t always get the happily ever after we heard so much about in the stories we were told as kids. But if we can all help make those endings better for anyone we can, in any way we can, I think we could make the world a better place. And everything, no matter how small, can make a difference.My condolences, it’s always rough and I hope you can move past and grow strongerI feel you mark,my aunt died 2 days ago.....I hope that Tyler is doing okay. I&#39;m sorry for their loses.Same hereSend love ❤One like = one respect 🙏I am sorry about that l will pray for him<b>hugs</b>Who the hell dislikes this video why what the hell.Ok why are so many people disliking? and &quot;Disliking the situation&quot; isn&#39;t an answer damn itI’m not very religious but I’ll try and send some Buddhist prayers towards both families ❤️you look like Mr. Jefferson from life is strangeNo mark. No I don’t think I will send this “Tyler” some love.Mark, as a stepmom, as a human, let me say that there is a bright spot in this—yes, it is absolutely heartbreaking; however, the simple fact that you are spreading love and promoting your vast network to do the same is huge! <br />No, it’s not about you, but YOU are becoming the bright spot, man. You are teaching and giving love.  💜RIP❤️:(Tyler know that you are not going through this alone, and others will always have your back.Happy late birthday Mark and Rest In Peace Tyler’s momBlessed are those who have passed, for they are resting in eternal peace and harmony, Blessed be the living, for they will carry the memory and love of those who have passed.I don&#39;t really have much to offer, but my condolences go to Tyler and his family. I&#39;ve never gone through that kind of experience, and I can only imagine that it is painful as hell, and I&#39;m really sorry for their loss.I sympathize for Tyler so much.  My grandpa died when I was 4, and it was the hardest thing to go through.  Tyler is such a good person, and so was his mother.  But she&#39;s in a better place now, and she&#39;s no longer suffering.  RIP Tyler mom and RIP Jay.Rest in peace..Sorry for your friendMy cousin died yesterday 😥😥😥This is what sucks about being under 18, the fact that i cant donate. :(There should be 0 dislikes why is there 4.6kwoohoo more podcast sad bullshit.<br /><br /><br />We&#39;re here for entertainment and games. Posting these is an insult to them.Awww I’m always here for you. Tell Tyler me and my family are thinking of him and send good wishes and lots of love ❤️❤️❤️Wow this is on #1 on trending I give much love to all that were affectedI will send lots of love to both of them thank you mark you have done what what you can doI really relate to Tyler man, I’m 17 and I lost my mother 2 years ago. I’m so sorry Tyler and just know I feel the pain.All my love and wishes to Tyler and his family.. same to Jay&#39;s family... rest in peace both Jay and Cindy..Rip jay and Cindy 😥😥😥God bless Tyler&#39;s mom and I am very sorry his loss.I understand what you are going through, Tyler, my family has gone through many things like that such as my aunt passing away from breast cancer and many others also passing. I hope you get through this and come out a better person. Sending so much love your way and I hope for peace in a difficult time.Why is this the #1 trending? I love you Mark, but making this video was a mistake. Millions of faceless people saying sorry because they only cared about what you thought of the woman. And it’s really big insult that you made it personal for you. I hope you this wasn’t your idea of giving Tyler a Condolence card. If it is, shame on you. When you ask “please show support” you immediately say why she mattered to you. Not why she mattered to Tyler. I don’t go around praising my cousin for getting me out of a sensory overload situation. You should disconnect YouTube from personal friends who aren’t what spotlight. You made it seem like she did the right thing because you’re Markiplier. A funeral is for the respect of dead. Then everyone involved tries to support each other. Not outsourcing it to random people on the internet.I’m very very sorry for your losses. I send all the love possible❤️I unfortunately don’t have Twitter to reach out to him! Does he have Instagram?can we reach 100000 sub today!!??? dreams do come trueI just Subscribed and liked and turned on notificationsI am sorry. I wish I had Twitter to send support. Twitter doesn&#39;t like me so I don&#39;t have one. I&#39;m also sorry I can&#39;t give money however both family&#39;s will be in my prayers.This sucks but life is a bitch and life has a funny way to make you and your family better in a world and it is nature we all will die someday💓I live But face I would never say I live in Cincinnati how did I miss you￼Oh I’m so sorry.<br />I’ve never seen Tyler’s mom. Poor girl. God has a special place for her in heaven. 😔🙏Sorry to hear that Tyler. Your mom was such a great person.God bless Cindy I hope I spelled her name rightThis video moved me so much.<br />You have my condolences, Tyler.Who the frick is disliking this video!R.I.P Cindy and Jay. You won’t be forgottenAnd my condolences to Tyler and the rest of the familyStop having bad news. First your cousin now someone else 💔I demand this pain stopRest in piece Tyler’s mum. <br />Rest in piece Jay.<br />Rest in piece everyone who lost their lives today, yesterday and ever.When Mark was in Cincinnati and you see him but only recognize him nowAlso when do u think the next whisper challenge video is gunna be released<br /><br />Kinda want to see bob wade and Ethan in it if they r not busyI feel you, my grandfather just past away a few days ago by kidney failure... it was hard since I am 13. Going through loss is harder then people think it is... I support Tyler and his family a good life and hope they will always be remembered.Rest in peace and good wishes to Tyler and his family.R.I.P.🙏🙏🙏 Prays to you TylerRip🙏🙏🙏The universe has been around for about 13.8 billion years. We’re only around for 80 years. We have such little time on this planet and so much of life to experience. In my opinion, we should  enjoy life for what it is. Life is really shitty sometimes and people do shitty things all the time because that’s just how life can be at times. Enjoy from it what you can and all the bad that comes along the way, don’t dwell on it. Take it as an experience that you won’t forget or as a learning experience but never take it as the world is all bad because the more people think that, the more it become true. It’s going to be okay and in the end all your pain, all memories, all experiences, everything will all one day be a thing of the past and that to me says that I should just enjoy life for what it is and make other people and myself happy. I know how hard it can be but know that in the end, everything will be okay.One like ekwul a prayerRip Cindy and Jay, prayers for both of the families❤️I hope you feel better man.I now am so sad thank you so much TylerI feel bad that iactually can&#39;t rly help cuz im a broke-ass nurse :|That&#39;s sad Mark God bless 🙏Happy belated birthday.....also tell Tyler that I&#39;m sorry for him I give him the most love that I can giveOur prayers are for jay, and tyler’s mom R.I.P❤️Bless herJay&#39;s story hit really close to home. I also work in security, have been for a year and a half now. His death is a worst-case scenario that everyone is aware of when they take the job, but no one or their family and friends are ever truly prepared for. I can only hope that his children will grow up knowing that their father was a brave man who was compassionate and put others before himself.My condolences, I understand completly, I lost my wife a few months ago and I know that grief that he must be feeling.

He or She may not have been able to talk to you about this in the past, or perhaps they have talked to you about Me, but you were not ready to listen.<br /><br />The most important thing I want to tell you is that I LOVE YOU. I love you more than anyone in this world could ever love you. I want you to read this now and learn of Me because you are running out of time to learn the truth.<br /><br />Life as you know it now will suddenly and radically change in an instant and I want you to be ready.<br /><br />MY NAME IS JESUS CHRIST, THE MESSIAH.<br /><br />I have come to you to give you eternal life. I have come in the flesh and given you the most ultimate sacrifice anyone could give in that I died for you, shedding My blood to atone for your sins; not only those sins you have committed in the past, but for every sin you will ever commit.<br /><br />The price for your sins has been paid. I was the sacrificial lamb, slain for you. Your debt is paid.<br /><br />I did this so that you could have access to the Kingdom of Heaven with Me and Our Father forever. You were beautifully and wonderfully made, intricately designed, and purposed for so much more than this life.<br /><br />You have known all along that there was more, that your heart yearned for something greater, something that would fill the emptiness, fill that space inside and ‘complete’ you.<br /><br />It is My greatest desire that you know that what you have been looking for is Me! I am the One who has created you for a special purpose and whose love for you will never die!<br /><br />My gift is a free gift, no conditions, all you need to do is accept this most precious gift from Me and you will then have all My promises.<br /><br />You must know that you could never do anything on your own to earn My love, or earn your way into Heaven. Your acceptance of Me and My sacrifice is all that is required. My blood covers all, and ensures you will live with Me always.<br />I have given you a book- The Holy Bible – that tells you all about who I am. It is your instruction manual in this life, and it tells you not only what has happened in the past, but it also tells you what is about to happen to this earth.<br /><br />I love all of My creation so much that I always let you know what I am about to do. This is why you are receiving this letter. I am about to make Myself known in a very powerful way. Because so many have chosen not to accept Me for who I am and follow My commandments for your lives, I will shake the very foundations of all you know to be your security. This is how I will get the attention of My creation.<br /><br />I do not want you to be in fear, and I do not want you to miss the most important reason that you were born to be here. This reason is to have an intimate relationship with Me. To not choose Me is to choose a life in darkness eternally.<br />I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I offer you this gift and this decision because of the free will I have given you. I would never force you to love Me, but you must know that to ignore My desires for your love means eternity without light, love, peace and joy. It is a life wasted and cast away.<br /><br />Don’t waste another moment believing the lies of My enemy, the devil.<br />Don’t believe that life will go on continually the way it always has been.<br />Time as you know it is over and I am coming to make all things new.<br /><br />The signs of the times in which you live are all around you. Life as you know it has become unsustainable. Everything that can be shaken, will be shaken, and you will be forced to make a choice for your very survival.<br /><br />You will choose to trust Me, the One who created you, or you will trust in a system that will fail. My Word speaks truth and all else that is not of Me will collapse.<br /><br />Please, come to Me now. Come as you are. I love you no matter what you have done.<br /><br />My blood washes away all your sins and makes you white as snow. I will keep you and protect you, I will provide for you and when it is your time, I will take you home with Me.<br /><br />I will only have so many warnings, and then the sudden-lies will be upon you. Will you be ready? The choice has always been yours.<br /><br />If you accept this free gift and desire to know Me intimately, and want to spend eternity with Me in complete peace and love, please say this prayer (out loud)<br /><br />Prayer<br /><br />Father, please forgive me for all of my sins. I accept your gift. I believe that you sent your Son Jesus to die for me, and that He is your only Son. I believe that His blood has paid the price for all the sins I have ever committed, and all those I will commit. I trust in you as My Creator and in all of your promises. I surrender my life to you and ask that only your will be done. I invite your Holy Spirit to come into my heart and change me, and make me more like you. I want to be obedient, and I need your help.<br /><br />Please come into my heart this moment Jesus and make me a new creation in you.<br /><br />In Jesus’ name I pray,<br /><br />AMEN<br /><br />Your loving Father,<br /><br />Jesus Christ, the Messiah (Yahushua ha Mashiach)Honestly who disliking thisGod blessed here Tyler.It’s pretty shitty of people to show up randomly to a funeral service where they do not belong JUST to get some attention from their favorite YouTuber...but people do it, and those people need to mental help.I send my condolences to Tyler.

And i know for a fact personally how it feels to lose someone so special to you..... And i also know that no amount of words can lighten the true pain and sorrow you really go through during a time like that..... But i still, like a lot of us here, would like to say something regardless......<br />Always remember the love she had for you.... She may not be on this physical earth any longer but her love for not only you and the others in her life that meant so much to her still lives on....... She is one with the Angels now..... Shining Brighter than she ever could have while she was here... She still watches over you...... And she would want nothing more than for you to know she wants a smile on that face..... <br />Always remember the good memories you had.... Dont remember her for how she left this earth but for the impact she had on it and on the people that are here...... <br />For one day all of us will be Angels alongside her.... And alongside the ones we all have lost personally that had impacts on us just as she did on you and your family........<br />May you find peace in this...... <br />❤❤❤Hey markiplier tell Tyler that I can feel his pain because on my birthday is was told by one of my relatives on the phone that my dad got lung cancer and I couldn&#39;t see my dad because he was in a different state than me,anyway one day I got home from school and my parents told me that he died in the hospital from the chemotherapy and i just wanted to tell you to tell Tyler that it&#39;s going to be ok, Tyler if your reading this, it&#39;s going to be ok...Why don’t you donate to his Go fund me?My thoughts are with both families ❤️😞 I lost my dad 2 years ago, just before my highschool graduation. I wish I could donate to help them but I don’t have any money at the moment. Even so and even knowing that they’ll likely never see this, but if they do or if someone else has lost a parent just remember that it’ll get better and no matter your beliefs they’ll live on in your heart and your memories. If anyone is struggling with grief please don’t be afraid to reach out, don’t be afraid to talk about it, don’t be afraid to talk about them. I know everyone is different but when he died I enjoyed talking about him to people, in a way it made me feel closer to him because I never want to forget him and I want to share the memory of him. You’re not alone no matter how lonely it feels without them ❤️❤️❤️R.I.PSorry to hear that🙏🙏🙏I guess you could say that she didn&#39;t have an eggscelent time!I&#39;m very sorry to hear what has happened.

Keep on living and keep making your mom proud.Im so sorry for your lost Rip Tylers mom<br />Rip JayHappy late birthday!!🎂 I hate that i Didn&#39;t  say it sooner but YEAR.I.P Tyler&#39;s momLife is hard. We know that. When we step out into what is a dark and unkind world we need something to give us a little hope, a loved one, a light kiss, some good food, the warm sun; something to remind us that us that there is hope; something more. That is what a story should be, a tale to stand out against what otherwise is a bitter and gray existence. People say that a good ending is old fashioned and cliché, that its bad writing and unrealistic. If stories were meant to be realistic then we&#39;d all want to crawl into a hole for lack of spirit. And that really is what a story is isn&#39;t it? A reflection of the human spirit: creative, passionate, loving: God-made. To have a story that is &quot;realistic&quot;: that mirrors how cruel life can be, that mirrors our sometimes bitter apathy and that mirrors how bleak this world is if we take it as merely sticks and stones, is to undermine the very fabric of what separates us from the dust and ashes. We are created; there is a good and there is an evil and the good will win.<br />Celebrate the steadfast hero, the man who gets the girl, the last epic push, the honest character, the underdog; the happy ending.All my love and hugs and best wishes to Tyler and family and jays familyI swear if Ben Isaac makes a video on this....Love has been sent 💙Well it’s the only thing that happens to everyone in life and you just have to understand that it happens and it’s hard to get through a hard time so<br /><br /><br />Hang in there Tyler<br />Rest in peace JayI know I can’t say anything to make you guys feel better but I send my love to your family that your going to be ok! :)Wait, I gotta ask cause I&#39;m curious, did Mark&#39;s mom marry another woman after his dad died?what happened to ur stupid pink hairThis is terribly sad and I really hope that the 4.3K+ people that disliked rethink what they did because what they did instead of supporting someone in grief they did the opposite.This is so sweet of you to do 💗 Rest In Peace to Cindy and Love goes to the family 💗Wow lots of death, first Tyler&#39;s mom, then Etika, then Jay...  R.I.P I hope the families of everyone will find salvation, love, and hope and will remember the good times...Its terrible for someone who is such a good person to pass away when they were just the kindest person or How jay was doing a good thing being in security  and getting murdered.Its just wrong for very kind helpful people to die.I wish things were different,R.I.P Cindy and Jay.Rip JayR.i.P Cindy and Jay<br />Much Love and support to TylerFHomicide has 11 million views.

Even though I didn’t know Jay I wish the person who killed him would die instead of Jay, this put me in complete shock and I can’t understand how it feels but I wish Jay’s family the best and hopefully they’re doing good, When Mark said Tyler‘s mom passed away, well I was sad and I could also understand how it felt to lose a parent, I happened to lose my mom when I was 11 years old due to Lyme disease, i’m not sure if Tyler Will see this but, I one hundred percent can understand how you feel and how it is to lose somebody you are very close too, i’m wishing Tyler and Jay’s family nothing but the best for the future and hopefully they are doing ok right now ❤️Yes sir I will send him all of the love I haveIm so sorry to hear thatGrief is the price of love. I know what&#39;s it&#39;s like and even though I&#39;m still dealing with it, it&#39;s hard when you want to talk to them and they&#39;re no longer there. All that&#39;s left is fragments of a person you love. There is no getting over it, it&#39;s a scar that will never heal. It&#39;s like that person was apart of your Soul and when they die a piece of you dies. <br /><br />No body anywhere can say anything to make it go away.Loves and kissesThis autta bring in the viewsGod bless Tyler&#39;s mother&#39;s soul and we will support Tyler, jay, and for mrs Cindy as much as we can 😊 we won&#39;t let u down and stay strong we all believe in u<b>R.I.P.</b>R.I.P Tyler&#39;s Mom<br />R.I.P Jaycompassion is everything.

As for everyone please be safe some crazy things have been happening around the world in shootings, bad accidents, something is happening and we all need to be safe. I wish everyone well and be careful.😔Jesus Christ. You&#39;re an actual moronic clown. If you&#39;re going to ask people to send love, then it&#39;s not genuine. Also how come you have to talk almost every month about some Radom sad shit that&#39;s happened to you or a friend&#39;s parent? Jesus Christ. It pleases me that you didn&#39;t stretch this video to 10 minutes for monetary gain.kyhu😓💜Plz do more happy wheels. I love that game and thus is the last year that adobe flash player will exist. Thx.Sorry  for  your  loss, I know  how you feel  my grandmother  sadly  died.I wish Tyler all the LOVE from dogs,cats,MarkiPoo and everyone who cares. Plz like 4 Mark to seeHappy birthday mark and I will go show love to TylerIt is unlikely that many people will see this thesis of a comment, but that does not matter to me;<br /><br />While this news is incredibly unfortunate, and we definitely need to put our hearts out to those greiving, we also shouldn&#39;t center it on pity. Of course those who have lost Cindy and Jay are in pain, and it is terribly important that we show our support for them, but we also should be careful of not just saying &quot;This is so sad!&quot; or &quot;Oh my goodness I feel so bad!&quot; because they already know it&#39;s sad. They already know it&#39;s made everyone feel bad. They don&#39;t need you to tell them that it&#39;s extremely unfortunate, they need your love and support. Whether that means just telling them something nice, or donating money, focus on helping them recover and know that others care and have their back in times of sorrow. <br />So simply put, help those in pain to feel comfort and know that there are many people who care and are attempting to help make things better after loss. And please do not baby the situation or make it a sob-story. This is about helping those who have lost human beings in their lives.<br /><br />(This comment is in no way to preach anything, or to objectify others; I am incredibly sorry if anyone feels targeted or put into a category when they did nothing related to such. That is not the intent of thus comment, so I apologize if that is the case for some.)<br /><br />That being said, all our hearts go out to Mark, Tyler, the entirety of Tyler&#39;s family, Jay&#39;s children, and the entirety of Jay&#39;s family. Most of us have never met you guys, but we know that you are strong, loving, caring people in a time of distress. And we are all here for you, with all the love and support we can fathom for those lost, and those hurting.i don’t know what to say rest in peace to cindy and jay qnd let jay’s assailant burn in hellpff garb vid, wasn&#39;t even funnyClearly you&#39;re doing this for attention.

Since some crazy people recently think it&#39;s okay to just invade peoples lives at funerals and memorials. Just because we watch them doesn&#39;t make them our friends. It&#39;s nice to think that way but you, to them are complete strangers. It&#39;s sad but it&#39;s true. They want to know us and meet us but not like that. If you ever think going to a funeral or memorial service to &quot;meet&quot; a youtuber or even a celebrity rethink your life...it&#39;s not okay. Respect them. They&#39;re people too.K so like life can you stop being such a dick to mark ya know <br /><br />He really don’t deserve that sheetHappy birthday and 24mill  and I&#39;m sorryR.I.P. Jay<br />R.I.P.

There are ups and downs through life that you have to traverse and the death of the person who guided you, the person who cared for you, the person who unconditionally loved you, the person who helped you reach for your dreams, the person that got you to where you are, is the biggest down you will ever experience in your life. Embrace the good memories and times you had with her and let it be a lesson for your other family and friends. Love them while they last, because once they&#39;re gone, they&#39;re gone. Have good times with each other, laugh with each other, and enjoy life with each other, and most of all, appreciate the time you have with them because that is never coming back. Everyone has a time when they will die, and each second is precious. Your future is very bright and you have lots of things ahead of you. Love the work you do for all of the videos and it&#39;s great to have people like you in this world.who the hell dislikes this video?;[ I&#39;m sorry, Tyler.and Mark.RIP Cindy <br /><br />RIP jay  sending my love to allYou probably won&#39;t read this mark but I know how Tyler and you feel my dad passed recently as well from heartattack so I understandRest In Peace💜~<br />everything will be okay insha’Allah💜~May Tyler&#39;s Mom rest in heavenly peace and always watch over Tyler and Mark and forever may she be in our hearts.Rip cindy TylerI&#39;m sorry to hear that Tyler we all love youJust because they are gone doesn’t mean they aren’t goneIm sorry for your losses and happy birthday mark big 30R.I.P Tyler&#39;s mom.<br />They shall be in are hearts forever. ;-;I’ve been subscribed to Markiplier when he had 104k SubscribersR.I.P LucekI want to seend help and love for him and you but i cant in the go fund me thing but i cant help or send love besides here so if tyler and mark is seeing this i hope you both feel better i hate to see mark this way and i know how tyler and mark feel its just so hard to go through this so i hope you feel better we all love you and try to have a good time.R.i.P Cindy❤ she will always be remembered as the kind person she was🙇‍♀️🙇‍♂️🌸🌹🌼  Tyler I wish your family with great luck🍀🍀🍀💐🌻🌺🌷 R.i.P Jay he will be remembered as a great dad he once was and still is🙇‍♀️🙇‍♂️🌹🌻🌼 All the best wishes to jay&#39;s family I give you a lot of my support💮🌸🏵🍀🍀🍀🌺Did they catch the killer?RIP Cindy and Jay.

First of all, Happy Late Birthday! I retweeted a tweet of a video that you should probably take a look at. But more importantly, at this point, I know what it is like to lose someone you love very much. I think about them every hour of every day. But the end is never the end. Whenever I think about the ones I’ve lost over the years, I like to think that they are always watching over me from above. And I know that someday, I will see them again. But as you go on with your life, you may realize that you are never alone. There are people that are always there for you no matter what. Be strong Tyler. You don’t have to go through this alone.

We can house them, and feed them, and pay for their school and give them a comfortable life.

Good job, YouTube!Where in CincyR.I.P Cindy 😭😢😪💔<br />Stay strong Tyler 😟😭😭😭😭I SEND ALL MY LOVE TYLER!!who is heProud of you Mark as a person spread the love people! This is importantMarkiplier and sad news. Name a better comboI&#39;m sorry for everything bad that happened to them I am really sorry I can&#39;t do much but I hope everything turns out well for the two familiesHow could people dislike this video?FThis just shows how much of a kind and caring person Mark is. He made this video to support his friends and family, and there wasn’t a single mid roll, which proves how much he truly cares.There is no happy ending sometimes... And it&#39;s ok to be sad and end something with tears... And it&#39;s good that you are supporting your friends and family, and Tyler needs a big hug. Everyone send Tyler pictures of puppies, and support to let him know we have his back.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️rip cindyI hope she rest in peace and I dont know how would he be feeling right now, my dad is dead which is not relatable but I have accepted this fact for the rest of my life. Honestly I imagine how my life would&#39;ve been if he would be alive. It might be easier for everyone in my family but right now things are not that bad too. So I hope hes feeling better and realize that shes still around him, she is alive with the sweetest memories ever . Mark you can pass on this message to him if that&#39;s possible because I dont think so that I can reach him right now.You look like John Lennon, lol!<br /><br /><br />Edit; Ooops, sorry i didn&#39;t knew about Jay and Cindy...This is number one on trendingSorry for your loss Tyler you deserve better all this work you put into the videos I&#39;m so sorry that you lost your motherwhy r u always asking for money when someone dies? even if youre not, it sounds like it.  when someone dies, you dont have to immediately fork up some money because they passed away.  i understand wanting to be supportive of charities related to someones death but even then it just sends the wrong message that things which happen in life that you dont want to can be solved with money.  i dont even understand it. grieving takes time and adjustment and acceptance that things in life happen because it can be unpredictable. i just think sending in a bunch of money to whoever sends the wrong message of showing someone you care.Rest in peace. May God give ease to Tyler and Jay&#39;s families. Sending out all my love to them ❤1like=for JayWhoever disliked this burn in hellPoor Tyler. I&#39;m sorry for his loss. May God bless him and his family ♥️.🙏🙏🙏🙏💙💚💛💜💙💚💛💜💗prayers for them 💖💖<br />rip cindy and rip jayI&#39;m crying rn<br /><br />Prayers to the families who lost someone ❤Rip bad news1 like=for cindeyMe too 28 June happy birthday to us 🎉🎉🎉I’m so sorry Mark. I hope things get better soon, and I wish I could help with the money. Unfortunately I don’t have any right now, but I’m really sorry for Tyler and your Step-Moms Nephew. I hope things get better. We all love and support you ❤️(I can&#39;t change my profile pic) BOI I don&#39;t want no hapy ending. I just want honesty and you have shown that. U r a normal human being so its understandable that u can&#39;t maje everything cheery and happy. Now I&#39;m not the person who gets to depressed on this unless it&#39;s my mum or my little brother (only those 2) becuas we all die eventually but the way Jay died is just cuz of how stupid most PPL in the earth which is reality. Life and death is a reality and we all have to except it so we don&#39;t  need any happy endings cuz we should know that that&#39;s just how it iswhy does this have dislikes?To Tyler things will always get better and you are surrounded by love ❤️ 💖💖💖❤️❤️💝💓💓💗💖💘💕3.5k dislikes: “Why are you gay?”Why tf are there 3.5 k dislikes on this?!that’s so sad. my heart goes out to tyler and his family. and also jay’s family. rest in paradise cindy and jay❤️The fact mark has to send this out after so random people dont show up is so sad😪This is so upsetting RIP Cindy and RIP Jay. This honestly made me cry so much. So sorry for the pain that&#39;s happening to you.I lost my dad earlier this year sad part about it is it was so unexpected no one saw it coming no life insurance we&#39;re still 600 short I&#39;m getting it fully paid off and then his vehicle inspection went out of date we were told that they were going impound the vehicle if we can&#39;t get the title switched over as well as an inspection this year has not been good especially since the majority of my family ended up using most of the money for a funeral literally about three weeks prior and so even now but a month-and-a-half after his death it&#39;s like everyone just kind of left us high and dry forgetting the funeral paid for it sucks it&#39;s horrible situation and then when your immediate and you do have that situation like I&#39;m and we&#39;re literally it took us about two weeks before we were able to do the funeral and services. It&#39;s not good it&#39;s horribleIs Jay the person who got shot in Appleton, WI? If not, then I’m sorry, but I wanna know is he the policeman who got shot? Also, big loves sent to Tyler and Jay’s kids for being so strong and having to live through this.Who TF disliked this video!!!Mark you are set up for life, why dont you pay for the go fund me.R.I.P Tyler&#39;s mum and Jay, love to all that knew them and had the chance to see their light shine in this dark cold world, I hope everyone is safe and remember to always tell your loved ones that you love them every chance you get, love you marky moo hope your step mum and jays child are ok and coping wellI can relate to both tragic cases way too hard. I lost a parent too. My father was also killed, he wasn&#39;t shot but he was murdered by someone I trusted with my own life when I was 15. Losing a parent, especially at a young age and in such a tragic way changes you in the worst and best ways. Losing someone to cancer isn&#39;t easy to deal with, my mom was diagnosed when I was 17 but we caught it early. I lost all of my grandparents to Cancer. My heart truly does go out to Tyler &amp; his family during this difficult time. I pray that your family gets through this difficult time. My they both rest in peace 🙁💔💯❤❣🤞🏼I was in tears and I don’t have Twitter so could u say to Tyler that I said that he is a great man and I think he can do anything he believes in even in times like theseso happy i have not seen that press f to pay respect memes (: but so sad just i cried seriouslyPraying for you, Tyler,  his family and friends. As well as your stepmom, her kids the family and friends. I hope y&#39;all feel better soon. God bless y&#39;all. Sorry for y&#39;alls loss.So. sorry TylerHappy Birthday Mark!!!Wat happendEvery like is one honor for Tyler&#39;s mumI am not crying, my eyes are just pissing.Poor Tyler.

So I know is how to lose a parent and a cousin..<br />You may be blessed by the god!This.... Is hard. Hearing about stuff like this makes me wish I had more money so I can donate. Unfortunately the only thing I can do is keep them in my prayers, I know not everyone is religious and that&#39;s fine. But... If I can&#39;t help out physically then I&#39;ll try to help mentally. Stay strong Mark, I know this isn&#39;t easy for you.R.I.P. 😞 mark, you are a sweetheart..who the hell had the audacity to dislike this video?!, heartless pieces of unloveable shits. i wish i could help out jay and tyler but i cannot. i do wish their families much love though, and hope they both make it through these hard times.May the lord bless Tyler’s mum for all eternity and may everybody comfort Tyler’s family foreverI know how it feels to lose someone  wish him well for meMarkiplier has such a good way of delivering bad news but I hope Tyler isn’t too affected by this because I really love his content tooWhy no video on Etika?? :(The most amazing people always go first...

Tyler and Jay&#39;s kids, I send my condolences and all my love and support.You have a good heart, Mark! Even God would wan to be your best friend.What good does it bring to the people who disliked this video3k dislikes? Come on now😑haha they all diedI&#39;m crying right now. I feel so badI wish&#39;t you a happy birthday Markiplier form yesterday and I hope you are doing okay as im seeing you have bad news I left the happy birthday wish in the other video, (how LOUD i&#39;m I?)Tell Tyler that I said I sorry.Heart goes out to u Tyler, plus happy lat B-day MarkI sent the link to my parents in hoping that they will donateim gonna cry oh my gosh );I lost my father about a year and a half ago, six days after I turned 15. I know what it’s like as well, and it’s so hard. The one thing that really helps is having support from people, which i knew I needed at the time but found no one there. It made things so much harder than it already was, and I’m really thankful that you made this video trying to get support for Tyler. I’m just some random kid on a YouTube comment section, but please know that you really touched me by asking people to support your friend, because that’s what he really needs right now. This was heart wrenching to watch, and I just want Tyler to know, if he ever in a million years sees this, that he has millions of folks standing behind him, ready to catch him if he falls. The best thing in the world is knowing someone has your back, and I’m so thankful you (mark) have the ability to express that to someone, and you use your resources to actively attempt to help the situation. Thank you for being such an amazing friend, and Tyler, you are strong, you’ve got this, i believe in you. Everything becomes a whole lot more meaningful now, and it gets exhausting, I know, but keep your chin up. I believe in you, these people believe in you, mark believes in you, the world will stand behind you with a hand on your shoulder. I know we can’t make it better, but we can certainly help walk you through the path your mother led you to. Just have faith, and even though it hurts, let’s keep taking small steps forward. We’ve got this.My sincere condolences.First off, I just want to say that this was a great talk and i&#39;m glad you are trying to help Tyler and Jay&#39;s kids, God bless them. And second, I am sending all the possible love to Cindy, Tyler, and Jay&#39;s children. It makes me so proud to hear that the GoFundMe campaign has surpassed it&#39;s goal. I hope they grow up to be well educated, well loved, and most importantly, happy. By the looks of it they will. I can&#39;t send any money, but i can send all the love in the world.<br /><br /><br />R.I.P Jay😔🖤<br /><br /><br />R.I.P Cindy 😔🖤I’m crying:( :(LolMy dog went to heaven yesterday.

I really do... this month has been very bad for my family too... my grandpa passed away from cancer at the beginning of this month and just recently my aunt just passed away from having three strokes. It&#39;s been very rough... so believe me I know how you feel. We just have to keep our heads up and give our families hope and love. We cant let this dictate how we act to the people we love. Just push through mark. You have done amazing things for your family and friends and that gives me hope. And I dont know if you&#39;ll see this or not but if you do. Thank you. You&#39;ve given me hope to push through. Lately I&#39;ve been struck with unfortunate health problems and depression but you&#39;ve given me hope to push through the day. Thank you mark.

Rest in Peace Tyler&#39;s mother &lt;3Tell Tyler I said God bless his familySaw u on my tv. I live in cincy. Wondered why but had places to go.FYou don&#39;t know how much someone means to you until they are taken away<br />Only then can you truly know how much you love and cherish them<br />It doesn&#39;t feel good to lose someone.<br />It never does.<br />It will hurt.<br />But I promise you, it will get better.<br />I send my compassion and empathy for everyone who loved Tyler&#39;s mom and Jay.<br />Because even the smallest gestures of kindness can make these moments in peoples lives better.I am heartbroken to hear this.. May you rest in peace, Jay and miss Cindy. I wish both of your families the absolute best, and that they find peace again eventually.Now, i almost rarely comment on Markiplier&#39;s videos. But i&#39;ve been a fan of his content at almost the very start of his YouTube career, I was a subscriber for 7 years. I forgot which account I used, but I can confirm of being subscribed for 7 years. Throughout all of these years I&#39;ve seen various phases and various types of content Markiplier has been in a journey through. I can remember when Markiplier used to do Drunk Minecraft, and his very first Happy Wheels videos.. also Turbo Dismount and SCP. I really enjoy the content Markiplier has given for the audience and his friends. We have lost some people in these past years. But they will always be in our hearts. Especially Jay and Cindy, may they be blessed and be happy in Heaven.:(Tell Tyler im praying for him and hope everything will be alright we are always here for him and we will always care for him i know he is your friend and he is so funny and i love watching you making videos with him and sorry Tyler but stay strong and we are always here for you and we care about you stay strong and keep showing love TylerOh, my god. I’m so, so sorry for you guys. Really, I’m sorry. I know what it’s like to lose a loved one. My father passed away a few years ago, and it hurt like hell. I feel so bad for him. I know that simple words won’t matter, when it comes to  something like this, but Tyler, man, I’m so, so sorry for you.I&#39;m sorry for your lost. And sorry for your friends lost.

And I’m sorry for the loss of your stepmom’s nephew. Losing someone is one of the hardest things we go through. ❤️I hate to see you and Tyler sad. But without sadness there wouldn&#39;t be happiness. But hey, as things are going down in a while things are about to go up! And just a question, is Tyler Bestinclass? Because he looks a lot like him.R.i.p Tyler’s mom <br />R.i.p Jay<br />We give all our ❤️ and prayers🙏 <br /><br />Xoxo💕heal, to allIt&#39;s sad how we don&#39;t miss someone until their gone, appreciate what you have with the time you still have with themShe sounds like such a sweet woman. I hope she’s at peace because I can’t imagine someone with so much good in their heart could possibly be anything else. <br />I’ve lost two family members in the last few months, one from my mom’s family, one from my dad’s, both murdered. I didn’t know either of them very well, so all I can do is watch my family from the outside and comfort as best as I can, and I’m so proud of you for doing the same thing Mark. Tyler is lucky to have you there supporting him at a time when he must be in so much pain.<br />I wish all the best for Tyler and for your step-mom and her family. I hope Jay’s children grow up safe and happy, despite their loss.<br />Make sure Tyler takes all the time he needs to mourn his mother, because sometimes people try to move on before they’re ready and they wind up hurting themselves more for it. Take care, all of you, including you Mark. I know you said not to make it about you, but your bleeding heart can hurt you - so don’t burn yourself out emotionally.Why are there dislikes?

We will support you through everything. 💜All of my undying love and support goes to Tyler’s and Jay’s family❤️So i guess the 3.2k dislikes are either bots or some people without even a fckin heart.<br /><br />R.I.P Tyler&#39;s MomIt’s great that so many people want to help others in emotional distress, but does the death of a family member really warrant a public fundraising campaign? People are dying of cancer and untreated illnesses all the time. Shouldn’t we prioritize helping those people rather giving money to the perfectly healthy remaining members of this family who should be capable of caring for the kids themselves and are only being noticed because they’re friends of a big YouTuber? Again the generosity shown is great and I’m sure the family appreciates it, but I don’t really feel like it’s warranted.R.I.P Tyler’s mom 🙏<br />R.I.P jay 🙏<br />You may rest and all love and prayers will be to youR.I.P tyler&#39;s mom<br />R.I.P Jay<br />may you all be in heaven for your loveWe&#39;re losing too many people lately.Much love❤️To Tyler may his Mother rest in peaceR.I.P.

I&#39;d give my whole paycheck for a month or two for those kids. <br />It&#39;s hard when a family member is shot.

Guys, Markiplier is not the type of person to ask for people to donate money, and NOT donate as well. He holds these (i think) monthly charity streams so he can support fundraisers that help people. Markiplier is an extremely kind and thoughtful person, and to those 3,000 people that disliked the video, I want to say, why? Why on Earth are you heartless enough to not even send a family condolences? Not even a simple, &quot;I&#39;m sorry for your loss&quot;? Come on guys. This community could be much better.I live in Cincinnati and all i can say is im so sorry for him and if i see him EVER ill give him a BIG! Hug ❤ im so sorryPrayers for Tyler and Jay’s family ❤️Love and prayers for both Jay and Tyler&#39;s families.Title should be changed to &quot;Some good news&quot;This being #1 trending means there is hope for the worldWhy are the asking for monetary support?

My love goes out to you man, keep good memories of her, and keep her alive in your heartR.I.P tyler&#39;s mom and Jay..<br />I wont  forget them.Rest In Peace Tyler’s Mom and Jay. You will be missed. You are in a safe place. Rest Easy ❤️Fellow Youtubers, we are gathered here today to mourn the unfortunate passing of the astonishing mother of Tyler, one of our content creators of great fame. Although most of us have never experienced her glory within our collection of recordings or possibly ever, according to a witness of our own, Markiplier, she had all sorts of passion and strife. Yet those optimistic thoughts follow the optimistic thinker&#39;s heart and soul for life. May her weary soul be laid to rest within the nurturing arms of the ones above.<br /><br />Another unfortunate passing is in need of mentioning is Jay, a single father of three children and a security guard of a yet-to-be-named establishment who was shot by an experienced intruder. May this fool be damned to the fiery pits of Hell and may Jay live on within our memories. We may now lower the caskets.DarealKoe- Probl3mz thank me now you won&#39;t regret!!How you gonna dislike the videoWho would dislike this is a monsterToday is my birthday 0_0Im so sorry, im not a religious person but i pray to those people, to tyler and to jay&#39;s family❤God bless cindy.Bless his mom and never forgive memoriesI&#39;m so sorry for this tragedy.. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to loose a parent but I have dealt with death in family before in a hard time and trust me when I say it gets better.

I hope you will get better soon. R.I.P Jay as well, as a security person, I think you do think of a day you wouldn’t make it but it would hurt so much to not see your kids. I don’t know the feelings of Tyler and Jays’s family is having but I can’t say its anything happy. Me personally, my dad cheated on my mom so I basically don’t have a dad or don’t have a dad that care for me. I know how it feels to loose a family member or to not have the most important one in your life, anyway this isn’t about me. Tyler, I hope you will feel well soon and better things to happen to you in the future. Jay, I really hope your children grow up into great people and i’m sure you will too. I’m tying this on my ipad so forgive me. I’m also asian so really sorry if i make a mistake.Bless her heart.

And yeawhoever down voted this video......you have no soul.  Thoughts are with them Mark. R.I.P.I tweeted Tyler sending love and now I will for you and your family. &lt;3 and prayersMe and mark have the same birthday 🎂🎉🎁Long story short?I feel like there are a lot of people who would ask for money in this situation and say they have ptsdRip 😰Its kinda sad you cant tell us before when a memorial sevice, people should know not to go to a memorial sevice and give them some privacy. But People sometimes people care about meeting someone popular than actually respecting a death and showing sympathy.I just started to follow Tyler&#39;s Twitter and I&#39;m honestly heartbroken. I wish him and Jay&#39;s children the best of luck and recovery.To all of Tylers family and Tyler himself. I hope all of you are doing well and just know that I&#39;m sending all my love and support your way and you will make it threw this together ❤️❤️❤️❤️There are no words. I&#39;m heartbroken for Tyler&#39;s and your family. No one should have to go through such tragedies. Prayers to every one of yourest in piece Tylers momOMG! Do you hear what you are saying?????Sweet, sweet Jesus,  heal his ears because he needs to be able to hear. Go on a vacation, get away from it all.  All of it,  get away from all of it for two or three weeks and don&#39;t tell anyone where you are or where you are going. You are deaf but you think you can hear. Leave your phone at home. Don&#39;t even tell your mom, just go.  Or your dad,  don&#39;t tell him either.  Run, run now.  Just let your utube run. Be safe! Be well!  On a lighter note , I have been an aspiring writer for 40 f###,years and have not been paid for anything I have ever written, except for my granny who gave me a quarter and hung it on the refrigerator for all the world to see.  It was a terrifying moment that I&#39;m not sure one should share with their grandmama. Anyway,  That novel has already been written by someone,  a Young Master Bates, I believe?  I know that was an awful joke reference from 50 + years ago.  Well,  I have completely forgotten why I started typing this to you. My best wishes for you and yours.R.I.P Ty’s mom we all heard you🙏All my love goes to Tyler and Jays Faimlyhmm, will marky be donating too?both great people are in a better place now<br />R.I.P the mother of tyler and to Jay, may the love and support help tyler and jays familyOmg I feel so bad I... i just can&#39;t say it&#39;s hard but it&#39;s part of life hope Tyler knows we are all here for  him 1 like = I prayer same goes for Jay I bet he was a good guy hope all our comments will support this struggle 💔<br /><br /><br /><br />1 like for marks vid not my comment😢😯😟😦my heart goes to you tyler, ♡<br /><br /><br />and all of jays children ♡Mark:send love<br />Me:🥰🥰🥰😍😍😘😘🥰😍🥰😘😘😍😘😍1 like and 1 sub = Pray to Tyler&#39;s MomRIP cindeyThat’s sad😢Hi Mark can you tell Tyler for me sorry for you lose.

May you rest in the clouds above#1 on trending, thanks YoutubeI wish the best for Tyler and Tyler&#39;s family Jay&#39;s family and rest in peace to Tyler&#39;s mom and JaySo sadThank you Tyler for editing Markiplier&#39;s videos, thank you Tyler&#39;s mom for helping with Markiplier&#39;s medication, and thank you Jay for doing your dutyAll my love and heart goes out to Tyler&#39;s and Jay&#39;s family.let them rest in peace. i wish i could help them but i dont have a twitter and i barley have an allowance. may them be happy in heaven and i will remember them even if i never met themAll love to Tyler and you guys &lt;3I know I&#39;m usually never much help with this, but I hope Tyler and Jay&#39;s families see this and have a better time trying to move on. Life.. Life isn&#39;t always easy. It&#39;s filled with regrets, filled with problems, and filled with tears. But with all the regrets, problems, and tears, there are solutions. There are countless solutions, and countless things to be proud of. While Jay and Tyler&#39;s mother may be gone now, it&#39;s better to remember the good things they tried to do. It&#39;s better to remember to good times they&#39;ve had. If you remember all the good, then you can cancel out all the bad, and you&#39;ll never forget them that way. Yes, I know times aren&#39;t very good right now, but these times will get better as long as you keep remembering the good. <br />With every droplet of rain the sky cries, there is sure to be a rainbow that follows.<br />Best wishes to Tyler, his family, and Jay&#39;s family.

Hopefully everyone else prayed.Tyler who?Why would someone downvote this?Markipliers a millionaire, he could&#39;ve just paid for their education himselfSo sad I cry one dab=one respect<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>doN&#39;T WOrRy MarK sHE wILL ReSPawN</b>Wow. It really saddens me when disaster strikes the people who seem to do the most good. Cindy seems like a really amazing person, and it&#39;s a shame that she passed away. I don&#39;t really know what to say in a situation like this, but I wish all the best for Tyler and his family. Same thing goes for Jay. Being a security guard can&#39;t be easy, especially when you&#39;re a single father of three. It takes a lot of courage to go out and do your duty knowing that any day could be unlucky for you. I wish his kids all the best, and sorry for their loss.Who’s Tyler? Rip to her momWhats crazy to me is that i didnt even realize over the past month Tyler was going through anythingI feel freaking HORRIBLE that the next suggested video for me after this was &quot;Another one bites the dust&quot;..... Rest in peace &lt;3R.I.P I know how you and Tyler feel... I’m not trying to make anyone feel better but sense this year started 4 people in my family have died. And it’s hurt me so much to the point where I thought about killing myself.  But you have to keep living, people love you. It took me a while to realize that. And again I’m not trying to make anyone feel bad for me, all I’m saying is, I know the pain Tyler is going threw. You don’t have to believe what I’m saying, but it’s true. And I just want everyone to know that if something tragic happens, just remember, it gets better. I love you all. And remember to try and love yourself. &lt;3Etika is deadI’m so sorry, Tyler ❤️ may she Rest In Peace as well as Jay. Good God, I hope his kids will be alright.Jesus Christ man I’m so sorry for Tyler and jays families lossI&#39;m sorry I have no money but I do have a few words tyler your mom is now in a better place and many other people feel the same way and I have huge prays to your familyR.I.P 💖💖💖💖<br />I’m so lost for words that I can’t write a proper comment,  sending lots of love to both families 💖💖💖💖Lemme me guess. You&#39;re quitting YouTube.<br />Edit: oh no, it&#39;s much more sad than that. :(When a video about bad news gets number one on trending 😑Poor Tyler... :(<br />R.I.P TylerFI&#39;m not crying I&#39;m promise T^Twho the fuck disliked this videoMy condolences. I honestly don&#39;t know what to say except good luck.❤️❤️❤️Woody dies in Toy Story 4.The last thing I’d want after losing my mom would be a bunch of anonymous people spamming me with “R.I.P. your mom 😢” you know they’re gonna add emojis or add some Fs.

Hope the best for both of them.May the Rest In Peace ❤️<br /><br />It’s awful how people need to hide about memorial services for dead people (like what happened to the Dolan twins) like Mark said because “he didn’t want anyone to be there.” It genuinely disgusts me people would actually come uninvited for funerals just to meet their favorite YouTuberI hate these type of videos. I always cry😞<br />R I P to Jay and T. Mum❤️That sucks, but do you need to make a 6 minute video about someone else&#39;s mom dying? If it were truly that important, you wouldn&#39;t be milking it for views. This is just lip service.Send Tyler some love b/c i don&#39;t have twitterIm sorrySo heartbreaking, Condolences to you all esp. the families of Jay &amp; Tyler 🙏🏾💓I lost a family member not even a few days ago so I can relate Tyler just know it will get better soon and for the children of three to jay I know this is very very hard and i can’t say anything or do anything about it but know it will be better ❤️💙❤️💙May both Jay and Cindy rest in peace. They sound like wonderful people and I wish their families the best.Ty we love you and we wish you the best and we are here for youRest in peace, you two 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭How can you possibly dislike this videoGod bless them all.Just saying one thing. It&#39;s true that with the fact we can know people from far and wide around the world we also learn more and more of the tragedies around them. But that&#39;s the flopside of being able to follow, be interested in, and care about those people, and most of all help them when they&#39;re in need.<br />So be thankful that it&#39;s thanks to being able to know them that we can give them actual support to bear the brunt of these events.I wish I could fund the page mark I&#39;m sorry for your and tylers losses.I can&#39;t even begin to imagine what they are going through. Tyler and Jay&#39;s family, you all deserve the world. Cry while it hurts, but also smile when you think of them. They&#39;ll be watching you, so live your life to the fullest. I can&#39;t do much to help you out, but I will send you all of my prayers. Make it through this day, and every day after. You may feel down now, but know that when you raise above the pain you can look back on life and say, &quot;I&#39;m proud of this. I can see my loved ones in heaven with pride in my soul and love in my heart.&quot;lolI wish Tyler luckMy grandma passed away on the 24th 😢😭1. I hope you had a lovely birthday Mark and 2.

I lost my dad 4 years ago on mother&#39;s day this year in 2019.😢😢 He was just taking a nap as usual, and got a blood clot in his throat, and by the time that my Grandpa went upstairs to check on him, it was to late and he was only 37 and I was only 7. I still cry every time I tell the story, I&#39;m even crying right now, as I&#39;m typing this. He was too young to die. 😭😭He still had his whole life ahead of him😭😭😭😭My WiFi is being weird so I’ll send support through this comment.<br /><br />To Tyler: you never fail to make me laugh in Markiplier Makes. These are tough times. But even then you manage to stay strong. Keep being strong.<br /><br />To Jay’s family: Jay put his life on the line as a security guard. That is what a good man would do. Stay strong.<br /><br />I may not have Twitter, and I may not have money right now, but I’ll show my support in the best way I am able to.Rest in peace Cindy and Jay.

I’ve watched Tyler and Mark do some really funny stuff together so I’m really close to them both. To hear that Tyler’s mom passed away last month is really saddening for me because I’ve always been confident that Tyler’s mom was an amazing person. Tyler, I am extremely sorry for your loss and if I could attend the memorial you can bet everything that I would go. Unfortunately I couldn’t, so I was there in spirit. I hope that you know that your mom is in a better place now. <br /><br />Sorry for your loss.I wish I could make a difference and help cheer up Tyler but I know one comment won&#39;t do much... I know how it feels to lose people... My great grandma passed away exactly a week after her birthday... I was devastated. My great grandma died 3 years be for I was born. And there&#39;s more losses I could put but I just want everyone who watched this video, please help Tyler. Hes a great person. Even if you don&#39;t know him, go help anyway. I wish the best for himI do not have a twitter so i will say it on this video in the comments and hope Tyler and or marks see it to tell Tyler that i give him virtual hugs, i&#39;m so sorry for your moms passing. don&#39;t forget that she is always with you in your heart and do not forget to grieve in your own way and time. sending love &lt;3may her love always be on the trending tabI send love and prayers to Tyler&#39;s mom.

Sending good vibes (:R.I.P Cindy, sorry Tyler that that happend...R.I.P Tyler’s mother, I really hope Tyler will be able to handle this ok, wish him and his family some good luck, I’ve never been able to do this well cause I’m usually the one who needs the sort of help in such situations, but I wish deeply for him and his family to best luck. I once lost my uncle to heart attack. Realising this at the time just broke me, but I’ve had friends and family there to help me, when I tried to fix my mentality and I couldn’t they helped me to build it, granted even though it was damaged is that it was helped rebuilt, and for this man jay, I hoped he was a good dad and that the kids have been able to have their family do this, I wish for you, your family and Tyler and his family is that they help each other and have each other’s backs, so that they can help rebuild themselves, I wish all my luck to you and everyone who is in pain of these newsWho in the world would dislike this vidoeBless be the ones who help others.<br />Both Jay and Cindy <br />RIPI&#39;m sorry to hear about the unfortunate events. I know you said that this isn&#39;t about you, but I know you feel some sort of sadness somewhere in that heart of yours, and this goes out to everyone that has lost someone they cared about, please, keep going, no matter what, keep going, I know that this is what everyone says, but it&#39;s true. Like Dory would say, &quot;just keep swimming&quot;, meaning to never give up. I personally have never lost a person I cared so much for, and I&#39;m extremely grateful for that, but I can only imagine how it&#39;s like to lose someone like that.

I swear to god... Tyler is going through a rough time. And you just say. &#39;OI THIS IS SHIT&#39;It took way to long to tell you &quot;Happy Birthday!&quot; I was in Animal Kingdom and Magic Kingdom the whole day. Literally from 8 am to 12 am! I was so worrried about not being able to and it was so crazy! My phone literally broke for like half the day and when it finally came on, it was DEAD! On the bus I was counting the minutes till midnight. When I got my phone charged and went on YouTube to wish you a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG0Xyc_wo-o&amp;t=12m15s">12:15</a>! I felt so guilty that I couldn&#39;t say it on time. If you even care, I said it on your video Fran Bow | Part 6 | BEING A HOOMAN! So I wanna say it now too, so &quot; Happy Birthday Mark! I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t get you anything.&quot; Your life must be difficult, espically Tyler&#39;s. At least right now. Losing anyone close to you is hard, espically a parent. His mom raised to be the awsome person he is! Losing someone effects everyone, even friends of the family. All I wanna say is Mark, Happy Birthday! And Tyler, I am so sorry for you loss and I wish I can help make the pain go away. I know how it must feel. When I lost my grandpa, my mom was so upset, same with my cousin, and my great grandpa. I don&#39;t wanna go into detail on how they died, but I wanna tell you, Tyler, I know the feeling. We all are here for you if you need any support.I just lost my dad back in February, unexpected, I know Tyler can get through this if I can at 15Millionaire wants more money !It’s been a while since I’ve seen any of your videos, just life has been busy.

I sadly cannot help Jay’s family financially but I’m sending prayers.A single death is a tragedyDonated 500$ to help out Jay&#39;s Family and sending love and support to Tyler. ❤I wish I could giveMy heart aches for both the family of Cindy and jay.

I lost family membersI&#39;m so sorry, Tyler...

Pathetic.Every sub I get in the next hour I will donate 1 dollar for each!Take as much time as you need for your friend and don&#39;t worry about us. Not gonna any of the pointless thoughts and prayers and bless stuff, but take your time.I don&#39;t have any social media so Mark if you see this PLEASE let Tyler know what I said. <br /><br /><br />Tyler has helped me so much through the years just as much as Mark has. When I watched this video I cried for him. I cried for his family. Its such a terrible thing. But as much as it hurts at least we know she isn&#39;t hurting anymore. And I know everyone says that and I know it doesn&#39;t change anything but I truly believe where ever she is now she is happy. My father also has a terminal illness so I understand his pain even if its only a small portion of it. They&#39;re in my prayers.<br /><br /><br />And for Jay and his children. I wish them the best. I hope that losing their father doesn&#39;t get in the way of their futures and that they can move on.I know what it&#39;s like to lose someone incredibly important to you however not someone as important as a parent, and quite frankly to me that seems like nothing short of terrifying and soul breaking. I am so sorry for your loss Tyler, Its never easy to lose someone and I can&#39;t imagine how devastating losing a parent can be, I know &#39;sorry&#39; from a bunch of random strangers online can seem meaningless since we don&#39;t know you on a personal level, but I hope you understand that we all still wish you best and are devastated you lost someone as important as a mother to any person&#39;s life since they are the reason we even come into this world.  <br /><br /><br />I am not the most religious person but I hope she is in a better place and watching over you and your loved ones from a higher place and guides you all to happiness and away from any hardship you may encounter.My Condolences to a son of a medical professional, a best mother, and friend. RIP Jay, you left something for us and your family, “the badge don’t make the man, the man who chooses to be and stand by the shield, is more platinum than gold can be ever more value”.Glad this got #1 trendingPrayers for Jay and Tyler&#39;s mom🙏HahahaWhoever disliked this deserves to die<br />RIP Jay and Tyler&#39;s mom.This is so sadFaaaaaaaaak yaaaaaaàaaaaaaW E  A R E  S C A R E D  O F  T H E  F U T U R E#1 ON TRENDINGI’m so sorry Tyler 😭Love when YouTube put videos like this as 1# on trending, shows there not fully broken &lt;3RIP😔😔Happy Birthday!!How could people dislike this video?! <br />Hold fast mark and Tyler and shame if you dislike this video?!?!Oh, Tyler..

Prayers and thoughts go out to them.I am youSending love and support for Tyler and Rest In Peace JaySryI keep you and Tyler in my prayersSending love to Tyler and his family.❤️ Thoughts and prayers are with you all!❤️🙏R.I.P I can’t donate money but i’ll try so hard and hope you will all be blessed 🙏May Jay rest in peace I hope he is watching his familyRip jay and cindy. I hope that Tyler is recovering well from his lossJay was a good person and didn’t deserve this 😔<br />Tyler was a good person and didn’t deserve to go through this <br />Tyler’s mom was a great person and hopefully she can Rest In PeaceThe loss of a parent can be devastating, my friend’s father passed away recently. My friend is staying positive no matter what and he gets help from everyone in town. His fathers death shook the whole town because he was a great man And was known throughout the town he also was my football coach. Not only did his death affect my friend and his family but it affected everyone. People have to stay strong in times like this and do whatever they can to help the person in any way if they lost a loved one.I&#39;m so sorry Tyler may Jay rest in peace  I will sent all the love I can ❤My mother died from breast cancer when I was 7. And it gets easier, it does get better, but it takes time. Best wishes to Jays family and to Tyler. But the thing that&#39;s even worse about my mother being gone, is that all of my memories are very fuzzy and I barely remember her. But at least Tyler has an advantage in a way, because he has known his mother for so long and will be able to keep those memories a lot longer than a 7 year old me could. So I know what losing a parent, and losing a parent at a young age does. I will pray for Tyler to remember her, and for Jay&#39;s children to remember their beloved father.This reminds me of my grandma When she passed away her name was cindy Too..If you disliked this video then what&#39;s wrong with you.You could fuel a barbecue with all the grease on your face.Rest in peace Tyler&#39;s momI donated 500 dollars but I hid my name because I don&#39;t want any of my cousins knowing are they&#39;ll kill me😭Jay I git your 6.

May you know peace Jay 😔<br />Stay strong Tyler, your mom would want you to keep going. <br />“It’s all going to be okay in the end. If it’s not okay, it’s not the end.” Sending love to all ❤️❤️I understand how he would feel, my mom passed almost 3 months ago. I&#39;m sorry for him and his family loss. I know how hard it is to lose someone you love and are really close to. I&#39;d do anything just to have see and hold my mom again. I hope him and his family will overcome the pain and emptiness they&#39;ll feel.Wishing the best for Tyler and Jay’s family ❤️We’ve lost so many amazing people recently, RIP Jay And CindyRip my grandpa one like makes me happyWhen life slaps u to the ground. U gotta get back up on ur feet.oh my god, so much sadness. That&#39;s so awful. I&#39;m going to donate a little to both causes, I can&#39;t donate a lot but every little helps.Rest in peace jayKeep Going TylerCan  I die now pls?We understand 🙂 May she Rest In Peace 😢😇We are here for you Tyler should you need anythingI always loved Tyler so best wishes to u and ur familyRest well Jay, hope you&#39;re doing well up there, and prayers to Tyler, keep going strong.Who disliked the videosI haven’t lost anyone, but damn I’m scared, you grow up with someone all your life and BOOM their gone.RIPsounds like she was doing her job not going out of the way.. it would have been fixed regardless, or you&#39;d have had some sort of malpractice lawsuit. i mean, if that&#39;s how you wanna see the situation then fine. we all know everyone has their own little version of reality now where cognitive dissonance is the norm.. just no need to talk them up like they were some amazing person. that&#39;s the same kind of bullshit they pull at showings, funerals and wakes where someone starts blabbing on like they knew the person better than anyone and they could do no wrong. i&#39;m not sorry to say that my dad wasn&#39;t some angel that lit up everyones life. he was, in fact, an asshole like 10% of the time. stubborn, gruff, funny, annoying, stinky, loveable and all sorts of other shit too. none of that being said does anything but respect who he really was, not who i wanted him to be. don&#39;t demean someones existence by framing as something it wasn&#39;t.R.I.P Tyler’s mom<br /><br />Stay strong, Tyler!Jays go-fund me got over the goal of $50,000. We got $57,000 buy only about 2,000 people. Our support exceeds your expectations.Much love for Jay&#39;s kids and Tyler. Keep strong, we are all praying for all of you.❤:(Rip jayDonated some of my birthday money to jay’s family <br /> ❤️It’s ok we understandI am so sorry mark when you are down we try to lift you up the same way you did to us when we were down and then we watch you videosanything for tyler. tell him we love him and that it gets better.Lol my sisters birthday is the same as urs lolNot even asking money. If Mr. Beast or any other major YouTube celeb watching this made even just a 30 second video to make more people aware of these 2 situations, it&#39;d be greatly appreciated.Aww poor Tyler &amp; Jay’s Family! Rest In Peace; Cindy (and also Jay). I send hugs &amp; lots of love to the families! &lt;3ripaww mann.... now im crying my eyes out.😧 this comment gives tyler more than love and support , and with such amazing people supporting him he will feel amazingit still surprises me that people dislike videos like this 🤦🏾‍♂️I&#39;m so sorry for the loss, but I can&#39;t donate since I&#39;m just a 12 yo with no job..<br />Sorry.. :cJeezus Christ....

Pass it on.Happy late Birthday!F in chat boys    FSo sad losing Jay, hope the kids do well, always remember the good times you shared.I currently can&#39;t give anything but support to all the families, much love sent their way for I know how hard it is to feel like you&#39;re missing a peace of yourself from losing someone you love very much. Rest in peace Cindy and rest in peace Jay. I hope everyone keeps the PMA even if it feels utterly impossibleHow is there 2.2k dislikes on this videoI hope Tyler and Jay&#39;s family be okay... They have our support and love.Death. I&#39;m probably allot older than you guys but what I&#39;ve been seeing is so much death.   If you&#39;re over 20 congratulations, now get to living your dream cuz you could be in a wormhole to nether regions any day now.Tell Tyler That he’s got millions of people supporting him right now, including meI don&#39;t have Twitter, so I will send it on here. I lost my Nana and my Great Grandmother all in one year, about 6 months apart. I have lost friends and other family members as well, more than I like to count in my near 29 years. Though I do not know you Tyler, or Jay&#39;s family, I send you all my support and strength. It is one of the hardest things to work through, and it is work, and all you can really do is keep going with the support of your friends and family. Take some time alone when you need it, spend time with your friends when you are ready. Know that you will always miss them in you lives, but eventually you will start to smile when you think of them. Know that you are not alone. I wish the best for you all.Aw! I give much love, I can&#39;t do it on Twitter sadly but I can on YouTube! :) I give love to both Jay and Tyler): poor tyler i will prey for him and i will send good vibes.I also know how it feels to lose a parent and i am so sorry about jay.... <b>air hugs mark and sends love to tyler</b> plz stay awsome markOmg 🤭😭.

And happy birthday mark. I just turned 23 with you turning 30Okay so first off I want send my feelings to this Tyler person we all lose someone that we care about and it can be a bitch. However you have to keep putting one foot infront of the other and keep looking forward. Now... the insensitive part. Who are these people I have never met? Why should I care? How is/was this #1 on trending? I honestly do not care much after the Tyler person. I am not subbed to Markiplier and I have my reasons which I will not go into. I will probably not see this comment ever again. Hate me I do not care. You will probably forget about hating me now, later.Rest in Peace Jay and CindySorry for Tyler&#39;s loss, losing a family member is very difficult, it does get easier. Take care Tyler.  I don&#39;t do twitter so I am unable to send anything to Tyler but my thoughts are with him.Wildcat Tyler?Rest in peace.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />F :&#39;(Gois heres the plan EVERYBODY SEND HIM SOME RIPS AND ALL THAT STUFF NOOOOOOOOOWRest in peace both Jay And Tyler&#39;s mom Cindy 😭💕💕Whoever put a dislike on this video you have no soul for the people that died.I will send loveMuch love to Tyler and his family!

So sorry to hear that 😣😣Jay&#39;s story hits real close to home, I&#39;m a security guard myself and just recently was threatened by a transient carrying god knows what while doing my rounds. Thankfully nothing came of it but I find myself thinking &quot;what if...&quot; a lot. My condolences to the family, security officers don&#39;t get paid nearly enough for the risk and sacrifices they&#39;re asked to shoulder.<br /><br />Cindy also sounds very much like a shining example of what it means to truly be human, the best we are capable of for the sake of being there for someone. I wish for rest for the departed and the families alike.RIP jay<br />RIP tyler&#39;s mom<br />❤💖❤💖❤💖<br />by the way, i know a game that could cheer you up: just shapes and beats, its a rhythm game wherr you play as a blue square and you dodge pink things while dubstep plays. i hope things get better soon, mark!Dude marks been through some tough stuff throughout his life.2019 has been a terrible year.

You are strong and you will get through this. You don’t have to get over it, but you will learn to see the light again and hold onto the memories you have.

I&#39;m sorry for your friend and family&#39;s losses.You have given this video a good ending!! You&#39;ve used your platform and contacts to make other people want to come together and help make life a little easier for other people going through terrible times. That&#39;s a great thing! ❤️Tell your mom we all feel so sorry for herRip Cindy and Jay <br />God Bless TylerRIP Jay<br />RIP Cindy<br />You will be missed 😔❤️❤️<br />Sadly I can&#39;t donate, or send love to Tyler through Twitter, but I with Tyler&#39;s and Jay&#39;s family the bestRIP Cindy and Jay... I&#39;m sure they were very good people. Hope for Tyler as well, i wish i could help but im too young to donate so i unfortunately can&#39;t 😓I&#39;m gonna try to donate about 1,000$My most heartfelt love goes out to Tyler’s family and to Mark’s family. I know that Cindy and Jay are resting in peace. Love to you all!<br /><br />If no one minds, may I share a story? Apologizes that it’s very long!<br />I feel my heart clenching on the pain it feels to lose a loved one. Just today, as this video was posted, my family and I hosted my Grandpa’s service as well. But as we called it, his Celebration of Life. <br />My Papa was such a funny and caring guy. Never have I seen my church overflowing with so much people. From family, friends, co-workers, classmates, and especially those who he and my grandma have taken in to share their homes with when they had none. It was such a blessed day that I can go on about but this is about Cindy and Jay’s remembrance.<br /><br />As to Mark’s story he shared, Cindy was a caring person, even to others she doesn’t know well. As a pharmacist, she’s helping strangers everyday! She sounded like such a lovely woman and I’m sure she was more than astounding. It’s always unfortunate when the best people who has treated others with the upmost care and love are the ones who are burdened with such a damned sickness. My Papa too, was taken by stage 4 cancer. <br /><br />The scripture we had representing his service was 2 Timothy 4:7, <br /><br />“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” <br /><br />Although Cindy and my Papa have both left us on earth, never means they have lost. Because they have won this race. It was a win win situation. For they could stay here with us or be with the Lord. They have won because they are free of the pain and are now soaring above us! May Cindy remain loved and remembered for an eternity to come, my blessings to Tyler and his family.<br /><br />As to Jay, and his family, I send so much love and condolences. Hearing about a loved one being shot is so gut destroying. Its unpredictable and unbelievable. My family also knows this pain. In 2009, my cousin was shot and killed at a bar in Texas. I was a bit too young to understand the reality of death so I didn’t know the sorrow my family was going through. I only saw him a few times in my life and at that age, the only thing I did understand is that I won’t be seeing him for a very long time. <br /><br />By Mark’s words, Jay is strong. The father of only daughters makes you a man to be feared and never messed with! Which is the perfect characteristic of a security guard. Sacrificing himself to protect the safety of others. That is what makes him the strongest man. It’s painful that he was taken so quickly from us and so many condolences to his family. I wish good things from now on and that his daughters grow to be just as strong as he. <br /><br />It’s very hard losing a loved one. It’s true. Life sucks. But there will always be a good ending. After death comes life. After a great fall, you rise above. Although we feel weak and lost in these dark times, the love...the memories...the power between family and friends and many other loved ones are more stronger than ever. However close or complete strangers we are to Cindy and Jay...when we keep remembering them, by old stories, to little tidbits of memory, or even a short video shared by a YouTuber...when we keep remembering them, they will remain here with us, and forever reign immortal within us and our within our hearts. <br /><br />Cindy and Jay are in my family’s thoughts and prayers and of course in mines. Again, so so SO much LOVE going out to their families today and the days to come. I only wish the most care and joy to them and that our families can only grow stronger from here! Although I never knew them, I still will show as much love and care that I can for them and their loss, and to their families as well. I am very sorry that I inserted my family a lot into this when it is supposed to be about Cindy and Jay. Thank you for letting me share my story today! To anyone who is going through loss right now, I give all my heart out to you! There’s is infinite love to share! Love to you all!Why would you dislike this?Tyler and the family, keep the heads cooled down. And Mark, take a break before you stsrt making videos again.
