ReiserFS the &quot;killer&quot; file system...You forgot to say that all journaling file systems are slower. You can format USB flash with NTFS (I did it), And it worked 4 times slower than FAT32. But you must have journaling file systems on your HDD or SSD to protect your data from system failures. And FAT does need defrag while NTFS and others make auto defrag.Tl;dr: I should stay at default values when formatting memory.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m sorry, but this video contains shit and useless info.<br />WHY FAT16 cannot hold big files? Why is volume size limited at all? Why there&#39;s problem with Windows supporting ZFS or ext4?<br />Nothing.Thank you very much, did not know of the existence of some file systems like the zed file system.This video is very helpful to help me clarify some missed concepts about storage devices and file systems for my CompTIA A+ 902 certification exam which I&#39;ll be taking next month. I took a class for IT security, and never quite learned much about macOS/Linux specific technical things. Thank you!Out of curiosity what about consoles that have thier own internal storage or Android devices?I was expecting to watch that how they work on drives actually.I was hoping this video was more technical and explained how exactly they workWhat are your thoughts on ReFS?It‚Äôs funny how the British try to use the internet to educate their people. As if some catastrophe is going to happen in the near futureSuperb Presentation !! Thanks.btrfs, f2fs, xfs, and reiserfs: Am I a joke to you?Very interesting for a non geek.I never had any experience with ZFS but really missed mentions about ReFS and Brtfs. Thank You for the video. :)Fat32 wasn&#39;t around in 1993. It was Introduced with Windows 95 OSR2 as part of the integrated MS-DOS 7.1 in 1996.Yo mama is so FAT they call her exFAT! üòúActually I was expecting a more technical video.The 4Gig limit of Fat32 was a pain. Glad to know that exFAT is picking up the slack =)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=6m50s">6:50</a> As far as I remember, I was able to open and edit stuff on HFS+ partition from Ubuntu..I have to use ext4 for my system drive? Huh, I better switch out my btrfs, then :P<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=3m40s">3:40</a> &quot;NTFS is read-only on Linux and Mac&quot; <br /><br />Not entirely. By default it will be read only however it can be made write-able. NTFS is only read only on the NTFS partition where windows is installed and booted off. I&#39;ve created 3 NTFS partitions on my disk and it&#39;s only the one with Windows on it that I ever had write issues with, the other two were read-write with no configuration necessary. The reason the Windows patition is read-only is because when the OS is shut down, it actually hibernates to disk, locking it in read-only mode. To unlock the disk, you need to boot Windows, and when you shut it down hold shift for 5 seconds with the mouse on the shut down button before clicking shut down, and you will be able to write to the disk.Very interesting video. Sine this video was made in 2019 it would have been nice to add Btrfs to the list. It might be still under development but since it&#39;s already in use by some Linux OS it&#39;s not that far off.so that how a geek sounds in British)Very cool, my computer knowledge is outdated and incomplete, so this was a tasty update.mine says btrfs for file systemI use PHAT32Awww ZFS gets a mention but BTRFS doesn&#39;t? BTRFS is amazing on Linux with zstd and snapshots. More than a year of use with no issues for me so far.There are programs available the can reformat without data loss. I have used Minitool partition wizard for years and have never had a problem.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=6m35s">6:35</a> the line starting with &quot;in 1998&quot;, I do believe some HFS became HSFxfs gangReiserFS FTW!I am an(Basically) electrician.  Started hobby constructing valve radios after getting(1962]  job in HAL.   Any video on valve type projectsReiserFS is definitely dead?by the way I never had issues reading ntfs formated flash drives on mac and linux, unlike ext4ty it was helpfulThanks  a lot. I had not any before watching your video. Very informative and almost complete example and explanation of all common file system.When you mentioned &quot;permissions&quot; with regard to NTFS;  &quot;Marking a file read only&quot; is not relevant,   files had &quot;Read only&quot;, &quot;Hidden&quot;, &quot;System&quot;, &quot;Archive&quot;, etc flags under FAT/FAT32 as well;  what NTFS really adds is discretionary access control lists (DACLs),  also known as the &quot;Security tab&quot; to those familiar with the windows UI for NTFS permissions.   This is similar to work Apple had added to HFS+/APFS.Very informative videoYou can back up the BIOS to a USB drive if it is formatted as ‚ÄúFAT‚Äù I keep a really small USB drive for this purpose.<br />Having said that, I don‚Äôt know what file systems are required to backup modern mobos such as the UEFI BIOS.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=7m48s">7:48</a> - not true. ZFS is supported by OSX with <a href="https://openzfsonosx.org/">https://openzfsonosx.org/</a> project. Also it&#39;s from Sun, so Illumos, Solaris is supported as well as FreeBSD or Linux‚Ä¶I like this explanation. So fluent and understandablea little correction: &#39;Originally, ZFS was an acronym for &quot;Zettabyte File System.&quot;&#39;It might be an idea to color the background of sections where your face explains things in a color other than the super bright white. Some darker color is much more eye friendly than this white.GREAT educational video, thanks!!!Great videoYou talk like a computer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And I love it.I know what Os you are talking about It was ubuntu mate as its initial file size is 4 gbBill gates, is that you?the intro to yhis channel&#39;s videos is almost as miserable as the presenters haircut.. but still like the contentI don&#39;t really like exFAT, because it&#39;s VERY error prone and its metadata support is quite bad. NTFS and EXT3+ are way less likely to suffer data corruption. IMO it&#39;s a terrible standard and I hate how the SD association accepted it as their standard of choice. NTFS is not case sensitive, so it should probably die too.Brilliant!!This is a reasonably good basic introduction, though I&#39;m a little surprised the major CD/DVD filesystems (iso9660 and UDF) weren&#39;t included.  They&#39;re easily more relevant than e.g. FAT12 or HFS.Don&#39;t make any more videos, dickhead.One of your early slides has NFTS instead of NTFSThe sad part is of course that all of these systems hide the option to use UDF, which they all support (but with quirks like not accepting it in partitions).I really loved the experience point of view, terrific video.Tech grandpaBut what is the technical difference between them?nothing about REFS?I‚Äôm waiting for NT128exFS.If you for some reason, need to have a Portable Drive with big files like DVD ISO&#39;s (More than 4Gb) but still need to use legacy Windows OS (like Windows 2000 or XP) stick with NTFS instead of exFAT. exFAT only works on Windows XP SP3 with a pach or later. If you only use new machines, exFATis a good option.<br /><br />And another option: There are a filesystem called &quot;UDF&quot; Universal Disk Format.<br />This format is used in majority in DVD and Bluray discs, but you can format a harddrive with it. The advantage is almost all operating systems supports it, and the file size limit is the same as all hard disk space.<br />Even windows 98 supports UDF, just use version 1.02 of it. I think its the MOST compatible filesystem of all.<br />But i think windows 98 and XP can only read UDF 1.02 and not write (its possible to write with 3rd party software). But its a good option for who work with legacy and new pcs and need to have a universal solution.Just pointing out that you can actually convert a FAT32 volume into NTFS withoit formatting using the convert command line utility (native in windows Nt4 and newer) :)exFat is a seriously rubbish filesystem that was created for the sole purpose of being able to patent some of its pointless features, so that licence fees could be charged for its use. If other companies had not needed to have something that was interoperable with the dominant computer operating system, Microsoft would not have been able to foist this garbage onto the world. Even the patents are questionable, but Microsoft have abused the patent system to create multiple continuation patents, and double patents, so as to push up the cost of challenging them. <br /><br />Files are initially held in continuous space, but if a file needs to be extended and it is not possible for the extension to be contiguous, the existing file has to be converted to FAT mode, which can take an arbitrarily long time, and may cause the device that&#39;s writing it to run out of memory before further writes are possible. If you have to use this filesystem to record long videos, make sure you don&#39;t delete files, but instead reformat the drive when it&#39;s full.A self proclaimed futurist saying 16EB is unlimited? probably no more than ten years to reach that for a single file size.Hm, i somehow expected a more technical explanation of file systems and how they archive and index files, manage the journaling etc.NTFS = New Technology File System. <br />Engineers are very creative in naming things.As many others in comments told. BTRFS is awesome alternative to EXT4 or ZFS. It combines many of the features into one and also supports native compression.Thanks for this video, it cleared up a lot of uncertainties I had about the formats.thumbs up for you on your very informative videos!<br />kudos!For all interested in ZFS, FreeNAS has been utilizing it for years and helps home, office users share and backup critical data and keep it secure. Find out more at <a href="https://freenas.org/">https://freenas.org/</a>There are ways to format drive bigger than 32GB to FAT32. Had to so I could use one of my portable HDD with my PS3 that wouldn&#39;t read any other format. And other than the 4GB limit had not problems.  But great simple explanation videos for people learning the basic.Although i know most of them, you gave some additional information about it.

XDIn my opinion, NTFS has some limitation that are stupid. Like the maximum pathname size or the need for defrag. Ext4 avoid fragmentation by relocating file at write if needed, that way you don&#39;t have a regular task to do with little performance impact.

What&#39;s your excuse?Thanksthank you, just found this video, had installed Linux mint few weeks back, and was little confused by the file system, this  helped me immensely and even after using windows ever since DOS only now do I understand even the windows file system better :) ... again thank you!Could you please explain the difference between (open)zfs and btrfs? because that would definitely be interesting to at least me! who&#39;s with me? Many thanks for this refresher and keep up the great work!Funny, I also had a failed unzip on flashdrive as well!I thought this would explain how the different file systems worked rather than just going through the specs for the different filesystems ^^&#39;Also a smal tip for Mac users. Install Tuxera this software enables reading and writing to ntfs volumes. The website of Tuxera: <a href="https://www.tuxera.com/">https://www.tuxera.com</a>No mention of Reiser? I heard it murders other FS&#39;s.Linus tech tips but after 30 years from nowI would love to see Chris to do a Jeremy Clarkson impression. &quot;This is simply the best computer....IN THE WORLD!&quot;For a second i thought it was bill gatesNo elaboration on ZFS and you didn&#39;t even bring up BTRFS.  Zed and Butter(Bread and Butter) are two amazing files systems that you should go into. I am going to assume you didn&#39;t go into them as they are mainly used in RAID applications and that&#39;s an entire video in itself.  There are also a few other errors about what FS works on what.  Most all OSes now can read and sometimes write to non-native FS.  The Linux system I am currently using to type this(Debian) can read and write to NTFS w/out any 3rd party apps.  I never really need to write directly to anything as NFS takes care of the rest over the network.  I can read/write from my Wins, Lins and Mac systems to my NAS via NFS.<br />Otherwise, another great video , sir...keep em going :)<br />I should say that I am aware NFS is not a true FS, but more of a protocol that provides compatibility.  Hooray for compatibility!I was hoping this video would go into some of the details of NTFS.   I think I understand how FAT works but have no real idea of how NTFS works.How about HPFS/JFS?my gf was postFAT which is why she is now my exGreat video!Are you time travelled from 70s?<br />No offence... I&#39;m just curious.My home computers are all linux based and at my doofus job they use (cough) windows 10.  So I&#39;m guess I&#39;m stuck with NTFS because I create ppts on my linux and transfer to work computers to do the presentations.  And yes, about 50% they get corrupted.NTFS external hard drive on a Raspberry Pi (Samba, Netatalk), MacOS and Windows 10 accessing it all ok.Please do a deeper dive into the pros and cons of each of the popular file systems. Mention of best practices to keep your files safe, secure and quick to access will also be useful.For cross-compatible usb sticks and HD&#39;s those are recommended but for HD&#39;s only used by linux XFS or BTRFS are the candidates and usb sticks only used by Linux EXT2 is the better option and about the only time I&#39;ll recommend it because theres no journaling it works well for flash drives. Stick to Linux FS if the drive or stick will only be used on Linux.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=2m35s">2:35</a> NTFS was not introduced to fix problems with FAT32 as FAT 32 was introduced only in 1996 three years after NTFS. NTFS is a derivate of OS/2 HPFS which was introduced in 1988. FAT32 was largely a stop gap measure to give large disk support to Windows 95.dont forget too Microsoft never paid to ibm the they contribution of the FA32 so miscrosoft decide to choose a onther systeme more independante ;-) and upgraped tooexFat = extra Fat&quot;Explaining File Systems&quot; = historical overview and attributes.<br /><br />Imagine that someone explains you how a hairdryer works: It was invented in 1927 by a guy who was given birth by a red haird woman on a rainy day and the first had 75W of power capable of blowing barely warm air....<br /><br />But of course you have to pump up those numbers right? (youtube algorithm brought me here not watching this guy talking blabla)Another great vid sir.No XFS or BTRFS? Many modern distros have completely forgone EXT1/2/3/4 in favor of either XFS or BTRFS. In fact I don&#39;t let EXT touch my linux distro for my main system given that it&#39;s not SSD designed and is prone to archaic issues fixed by newer systems. For my server systems I use XFS which is what most red hat distros recommend from memory and for casual systems I use BTRFS which is the newest and most feature rich and what other distros recommend as the default.I don&#39;t let even a modern Linux touch NTFS for writing, almost inevitably something goes wrong, often something small, that snowballs over time and when it&#39;s finally noticeable is very difficult to fix if at all. So many horror stories with letting linux write to NTFS. Fat32? Never a problem, never had Linux mess up fat 32I know your voice<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=3m33s">3:33</a> : MS-DOS/DR-DOS/PC-DOS all supported file permissions or attributes to be set.  You typically did this by using the tool attrib.exe that came with the OS.Zed&#39;s dead baby, Zed&#39;s dead. no its not ;PImagine that you don&#39;t know anything about computing and you watch this video :)so sad that exfat is microsoft and licences are that bad that linux won&#39;t support it without external packagesI use 4DFCAB Works great! No issues yet.what about 4kb~32kb~256kb cluster options. i expected to see some info too while choosing which one is the right one ü§îCorrect me if I am wrong, Before NTFS, there was HPFS (high performance file system) developed by Microsoft + IBM, it was designed for the OSWarp. Eventually the project failed, and Microsoft built windows NT + NTFS.What about IPFS?14 or 40 ?Great video! Thanks!rev up your enginessome really interesting file systems are not covered, like btrfs which i&#39;ve been using on a number of devices for the last decade or so - zero files lost so far. i first tried it when i bought a netbook which had 2 small ssd&#39;s instead of a hard drive. back then there was much concern about ssd&#39;s limited lifetime and btrfs just had the best feature set for these new drives. but that was not all, it also had native raid capability and snapshots and was really fast so after a couple of years i decided to start using it on the rest of my computers.Love it thanksAnd another thing, NTFS has journaling to prevent corruption but this only guarantees file entry consistency.  Data written to any file is not necessarily preserved via journaling, when something goes wrong, ie. blue screen.  It is impossible to guarantee data write integrity via journaling at FS level given that as an example, a DB update may involve a a transaction consisting of many file update operations.ZFS doesn&#39;t stand for &quot;zed file system.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223222515/https://blogs.oracle.com/bonwick/en_US/entry/you_say_zeta_i_say">https://web.archive.org/web/20170223222515/https://blogs.oracle.com/bonwick/en_US/entry/you_say_zeta_i_say</a>Thank you üòÄI clicked thinking I wouldn&#39;t learn anything, but between your great video and you guys comments, I actually learned quite a bit, cheers to all of youThis was great!

I would like to know more about Linux formats and how they work with other operating systems on a network through a NAS for exampleCorrections:<br />NTFS was introduced to get by the limitations of FAT16 not FAT32.  FAT32 didn&#39;t come out until 1996 with Win95osr2.<br />The MacOS driver for NTFS was a real POS.  I wouldn&#39;t even call it &quot;read-only&quot;, more like &quot;plug-it-in-and-see-what-it-can-detect&quot;.  I recall thinking the files on my external HD were gone on a Macbook, but the cheapo-winXP system could see them fine.Regarding the USB drive on Linux, why didn&#39;t you mention F2FS?<br /><br />I tried running GTA V on a microSD card (on Linux), and the only FS that worked was F2FS. It was magical!HFS for Linux: <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/fs/hfs">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/fs/hfs</a> in-kernel since 1995<br />HFS+ for Linux: <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/hfsplus/hfsplus_fs.h">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/hfsplus/hfsplus_fs.h</a> in-kernel since 1999 (does not support journaling because lack of interest)<br />ZFS for macOS: <a href="https://openzfsonosx.org/">https://openzfsonosx.org/</a><br />ZFS for Windows: <a href="https://openzfsonwindows.org/">https://openzfsonwindows.org/</a><br />Apple Bootcamp includes a driver for HFS+ for Windows installations in a Mac<br />btrfs for Windows: <a href="https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs">https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs</a> (work in progress)<br />Plus <a href="https://www.paragon-software.com/">https://www.paragon-software.com/</a> that offers free exFAT drivers for Linux, commercial drivers for APFS and NTFS for Linux, commercial ext2/3/4 and NTFS drivers for macOS and commercial APFS, HFS+, btrfs, XFS and ext2/3/4 drivers for Windows.<br /><br /><br />zfs from zettabyte file system.<br />TrueOS is just a distribution of FreeBSD.When you mentioned APFS, I thought for a second you said ADFS (Acorn Disk Filing System).

A better choice for system drives. Why no mention?request btrfs / f2fsBut which file system is actually the best? Which one is the most efficient?I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t cover Btrfs as well as ZFS, when you did more advanced ones.<br />Btrfs is quite amazing for some tasks.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Another thing I wish you&#39;d mentioned is other advantages of ZFS, the ability to use ZFS replication for file system syncing for instance with lower CPU overhead and bandwidth use then any other form of syncing that I know of.<br /><br /><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/rsync-net-zfs-replication-to-the-cloud-is-finally-here-and-its-fast/">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/rsync-net-zfs-replication-to-the-cloud-is-finally-here-and-its-fast/</a><br />And support for Raid-Z in its various incarnations (Raid-Z2 allow you to have two drives fail and still recover your data, useful since there&#39;s about a 8% chance of a drive failing during the rebuild process when you&#39;ve already lost one drive, alternatively go with Raid-Z3 to allow 3 drives to fail at the cost of more performance)that moment i saw this guy pop out.. id say he&#39;s legit..1 exabyte is not 1000 terrabyte. more likely 1000 petabyte<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=0m12s">0:12</a> - Haven&#39;t been subscribed long and forgetting who the host is...

It just depends on the BIOS ;) Older BIOS = less compatible. Newer BIOS = more compatible. Anyway, with GPT, even Windows 7 will recognize the latest drives.Great job - thanks for such a clear lesson.I wish I could&#39;ve used this video last semester to backup my argument with my PC hardware &amp; software instructor.  We had a lab where we were instructed to partition a drive into 2 equal volumes, a native Windows volume, and a Windows and Linux natively compatible volume, using only the tools included in Windows.  Everyone else used exFAT for the Windows &amp; Linux volume, even though I insisted many Linux distros don&#39;t natively support exFAT or NTFS, even sent the instructor an article detailing this fact.  That&#39;s also the same time I discovered that Microsoft doesn&#39;t allow FAT32 formatting on partitions larger than 32GB.  But I digress, I suggested to the instructor that he inform the class next time of the error, it is a school after all.  Schools shouldn&#39;t be teaching the wrong information, right?  But he didn&#39;t, and I no longer wonder why Americans are so stupid.  Being &quot;educated&quot; means absolutely nothing anymore.no BFS? i need some 64 bit files stucturesI fully appreciate all of the contents on this channel. But why I am not seeing common PC problems and troubleshooting guides?you&#39;re the man! always great and informative videos! thank you!HFS and HFS+ <b>are</b> supported by the Linux Kernel.I was expecting the dropdown list on linux to contain ~10 filesystems as it does on mine :p.

I was able to repair the and resize a HFS+ boot drive in Linux where MACOS could not do it even with third party programs, this was over ten years ago so nothing recent.<br /><br /><br />Also you forgot everyone&#39;s favourite ReiserFS and the man that made it.They is Software for changing the format and keep the data, some cases you can‚Äôt but in most cases it‚Äôs a none issue.<br /><br />It‚Äôs time a a file system was created that everyone supports so no more wrong file system crap, like OpenZFS remember when it cane about and we all had hope that Apple would adopt it but wait Apple invents another for its own use why Applei have NTFS on all my PC hard drives, don&#39;t know about my iPad.What about HPFS? It may not be used anymore but it would be neat to know about it.A Sincere Thank You! Clean and Neat explanation without the Self Hype.Great video.<br />Now it gave me better understanding when formatting drive.. <br />OS, ssd as additional and SD cards.<br /><br />All the best!I&#39;ve seen exFAT on more recent samsung external storage.  Seems like mac supports it while it doesn&#39;t support NTFS.  There was some package you could download for exfat support on linux.If anything should survive a catastrophic destruction of humanity event it would be 1 pc somehow infinitely powered by the only surviving youtube channel ECI take my hat off to your Sir, again. You explain things well Obi Wan.i loved this video, very accurate and on point.<br />please backup any information, then format, and then copy the backed up information. <br />also i recommend h2test to check for SD to be correct, it is an destructive test that write dummy files so backup first. and also sd formatter that could format recovering those SD drives that have a little part that not work or is incorrect in size.You forgot VMFS.except for <i>DVD-RAM</i> .These have from the box UDF 2.0 Format.I always use ext4, for both internal and removable devices.Excellent video üëçthank youGreat work.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=6m24s">6:24</a> hsf is my favourite file systemThe bowl cut is strong with this one.Perhaps this was addressed in another video, but I understood that the FAT file system also suffered from defragmentation, whereas that was less so the case for NTFS. For the Linux FS defragmentation seemed not to be an issue, there is not even a defragmentation tool written for. We don&#39;t have any mechanical hard drives anymore so it is not even a subject.Nice video, thank you.<br />Only info about ReFS is missing  :(FAT32 is dead, along with exFAT, ext4 &amp; APFS. NTFS (which, by the way, is the last filesystem Type) is on its last legs.Christopher, you are so affable and engaging. You come across as a stereotypical gentleman from England (to this American), and I mean that only in the most complimentary of ways.<br /><br />Your calm voice and relaxed candor lend themselves brilliantly to your thorough but simple explanations of things I have often found confounding.<br /><br />Thank you so much for explaining computers to us. Your installments of this program are invaluable to me.Great content!awesomeMany thanks, this cleared all my doubtsYou helped me out the confusion. Can you make the difference NTFS with GUID and GPTSpelling mistake at @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=6m30s">6:30</a> HFS and HSFI&#39;m also exFAT. I lost 10 pounds last month.ext4 ftw.So exFAT is kinda the best ‚Äúall-over‚Äù for the ‚Äúall-over‚Äù users, thank you for the video!I usually watch Linus Tech Tips to get a refresher on tech. When he explained file systems, it was biased toward Windows file systems. It was unusual for him not to explain common desktop Linux, MacOS, Android, and unusual file systems. It was unusual because even though he explains stuff as fast as possible, he left out many other file systems for more time to joke around. I&#39;m glad that you actually took the time to explain this subject in more detail!ZFS FTW!!! No mention of BTRFS?XBox1 uses NTFS for game recording, (not surprising as its a Microsoft computer)....it can‚Äôt save files to an Android (Samsung) phone which reads only FAT32.  But my old laptop reads both...so saving XBox files to an NTFS formatted flash drive lets you open it on PC...then save it to a FAT32 USB stick, which can load into my Samsung Galaxy S9.  That enables me to edit game videos in my phone prior to up loading to YouTube (my laptop is as old as Noah..slow and limited).there was no explaining what the video title said. just what os uses what file system. have thumb down for misleading vid captionOne thing thats worth knowing; exFAT on SSDs under Windows has no TRIM support(!!!)<br />This machine is dual boot Windows 7 and macOS El Capitan. I have an SSD formatted as exFAT that both OSes can read and write to but running macOS Disk Utility&#39;s &#39;First Aid&#39; once in a while is essential to keep the drive running well. I would move to FAT32 however I use that drive for editing video.Some comments regarding common file system support on Linux and other OSes:<br />* Ext2/3/4 can be read (but not written) under Windows using Ext2FSD IFS driver.  A free read-only FUSE driver is available for OS X/macOS. Paragon offers a commercial OS X and Windows driver for ext FSes with full read-write support.<br />* NTFS has multiple Linux drivers available. The most common one is the NTFS-3G FUSE driver from Tuxera. Others are TNTFS also from Tuxera (commercial kernel module, only sold to OEMs), and UFSD from Paragon (another commercial kernel module).<br />* HFS/HFS+ is supported by Paragon UFSD under Linux. Paragon also offers a Windows driver for HFS/HFS+.<br />* APFS has a commercial driver for Linux and Windows, again from Paragon.<br />* exFAT has three Linux drivers available: fuse-exfat FUSE driver, a commercial TexFAT kernel module from Tuxera and exfat-nofuse driver, which is based on leaked and later open-sourced (due to GPL violations) kernel module from Samsung.There is also the CDFS. I think this is how data is stored on data CD and DVD. Maybe even blur ray discs.<br />Just like you, I learned that FAT32 sucks. I was not able to copy a 4.2 GB ISO file to my 8 GB USB memory stick. I reformatted it to NTFS.<br /><br /><br />For FAT12, I think this was used only on floppy diskettes. I wrote a low level reader program and read every track and saw a part that said FAT12. That was back in 1998 when  I was 20 y old.I have a question. I have my new 4TB external HDD. It came out with fat32 file system preformated. I wanted to format it on NTFS but before any move I checked some info first. Well I know benefits and cons of each other but still have a question for anyone who is more experienced in this. I want my external hard drive only for back up purpose. I have huge files that are more than 4GB (now I have to separate files into smaller parts with 7zip) and a lot of smaller files. I would like to know if formatting could somehow have a negative impact on my external HDD. I have read some articles and some users who are also oriented in IT say  journaling is still running and thanks to this, it could have a shorter lifespan on device. Also one article recommended to stay on format which came out of box. So I would like to know someone opinion and recommendations. <br /><br />Thanks everyone in advance who is going reply me.In addition to the HSF+ and HSF typos at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=6m20s">6:20</a>, you also made a factual error on the same slide.<br /><br />HFS+ did not support journaling when it was introduced. HFS+ was introduced with Mac OS 8.1 (classic Mac OS) in 1998. Journaling wasn&#39;t added until Mac OS X 10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot; in 2002, a different operating system altogether. The main draw to HFS+ when it came out (speaking from experience) was that it made more efficient use of storage space for small files compared to its predecessor HFS. With HFS, the minimum amount of space a file could occupy became increasingly inefficient as drive size increased. HFS+ had other benefits too (larger max file size, Unicode, longer filenames) , but I&#39;m talking about its biggest draw at the time it was introduced in the late 90s.What about BTRFS?XFS: What am I? A joke to you????Excellent !! Thank You!!Mom, mom! John Lennon did not die !! He is on YouTube and is a computer teacher.<br /> Good Video.I love your videosTeam ext4 &lt;3There&#39;s a high pitched humming sound for almost the whole length of the video.What about BtrFS?Great channelVery informative. I remember some of this from my computer and networking classes when I was working on my Associates. Of course, that was in 2006, ant there have been some changes over the last 13 years. You break this down perfectly.here I am thinking exFat is just like Fat32 except it used to be fat hence the &quot;ex&quot;When your girlfriend is fat:<br />&quot;My girlfriend FAT&quot;<br />When your girlfriend dumps you:<br />&quot;My ExFAT&quot;I find this video highly misleading or very limited in information.<br />1) Should be noted that Linux dont natively support NTFS or exFAT not because they cant, but because of constant patent threats from Microsoft about those FS. There IS drivers if you really want them, NTFS3G and exfat FUSE module - not perfect, but do their job 2) There is several opensource projects to bring ext2\3 support on Windows, ext2fsd for example. They work just fine and installs as system driver and allows mount linux partitions as letter drives, ext4 support is so-so, thought. There is also utilities which can read and extract files from linux drives, but not mount or write 3) On linux there is also XFS, JFS, BTRF, F2FS...you are not limited to ext* filesystem and can use any, even for booting and /root 4) Also, not a word about CDFS (ISO9660) or UDF which is specialized but not uncommon 5) For flash media like SSD F2FS is good choice. For flash drives there is also wacky but working UDF-on-flash solution which is surprisingly supported by both Lin and Win.Hi Chris, a quick question mate. I had my 2TB HD fail about 3 weeks ago on this computer. Seems R/W head may have failed or jammed, whilst playing a game, the game crashed and HD became unreadable. I got a new 3TB WD disk. Sadly I had copied over a whole pile of holiday video and some live concert vid I was working on when it failed. I desperately want to be able to retreieve it somehow? IS there any chance to recover data on a failed HD? (Depending on the failure of course!) Linux kept telling me it was a comms error! ANY thoughts mate. IDC if I can&#39;t get it bootable any more, but to at least get vid and pics off it. I had it partitioned into 5 partitions, running 3 boots of Win7. Thanks!Hopefully your pro tip at the end saves a lot of people from wasting hours of their day when decompressing with fat32.So.. i&#39;m an absolute amateur in this.<br />I just did format my USB in NTFS. After watching this video i would definently use exFAT to not have problems when sharing files between different OS.<br /><br />But there is still the one question popping to my mind: why even using FAT32 still when there is exFAT ? Is there any point?<br />Do older systems have problems handling this new format?<br />Else i don&#39;t see why to format in FAT32 when always having to worry about file size and such things.<br />exFAT = no problems - or do i miss something?Why did you not mention XFS? This is the standard now on Linux...sorry but thumbs down. you are not actually explaining how they work.Fat, max volume size, fat32, exfat. These words trigger certain people lol.<br />Ext4 for Linux is really nice, I&#39;ve never had a corrupt file yet since using Linux for a good 10 years.More clear than ever about file systems!!!Why do computer manufacturers have to make it so complicated?  No one wants to support anyone else&#39;s file system, even when they are free?   And when you run into a problem like your 4 gb file limit, why can&#39;t the programs just tell you what the problem is instead of giving you unhelpful error messages?fucking love your videos .  best cannel on youtubeThanks a lot!!! Some times this info is forbiden.Great video m8! But tou forgot to mention:<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS</a>Through experience, I would not choose exfat if you have both macos and windows.  The no journaling puts your private data at a higher risk.  I had an issue where drive powered off, did a disk repair and lost everything.  I would choose ntfs, and have something like tuxera to read/write.  At least with it&#39;s repair tools you have a higher chance of preserving your data.Thanks, helped me a lot. Smashed fhe like button (y)Very nice and in depthI don&#39;t understand something. I always heard that their is 1000 kilobytes in a Megabyte, 1000 megabytes in a gigabyte and 1000 gigabytes in a Terabyte but why does it take one million terabytes to make a exabyte? I&#39;m not a computer person but I think this stuff is interesting and I&#39;m just trying to understand. Great video by the way, thumbs upwhat about ReiserFS?Great video, thank for shared your knowledge with us, saludos desde Honduras.Missing the speed comparison, which is what matters for some people. Especially for SD cards or Linux fast storage.You are the best. Keep up the great work. üëèüèªWhat happened to your mic at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=5m07s">5:07</a>?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=7m45s">7:45</a> I run o3x( OpenZFS on OS X )on my Mac, and have done so for several years.Just a heads up for you. If you need an SD card, microSD card or USB thumbdrive formatted FAT32 and it&#39;s larger than 32 GB, use a neat little program called guiformat.exe  At one time, I was trying... I think it was RecalBox on a Raspberry Pi 3b and I had either a 64 GB or 128 GB microSD card and at that time, RecalBox required FAT32 and that&#39;s how I did it. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s still the case with RecalBox. At least I think it was Recalbox - it&#39;s been a while.Thank u for this vid.great knowledgeable videoPlease, Linux supports all the file system you have mentioned. Please check again.What ever happened to HPFS (OS/2 Warp)?Way to basic !

Well explain and easy to understand. Thank youexFAT is derived from FAT. Unlike FAT32 (uses 32-bit variables to store data, have maximum single file size of 4 GB), exFAT uses 64-bit variables to store data. Linux systems need a utility called ntfs-3g to read NTFS volumes. Also, APFS is the default file system in macOS Mojave. Also worth featuring is ReFS (which was introduced in 2012 by Microsoft starting in Windows Server 2012.).I really don&#39;t like the idea that Windows 10 will not let me choose between exFat and Fat32 when formatting my usb drive/keyMan I just love your contact!

Thanks man!Thanks for everything especially <b>SPEAKING SLOWLY</b><br />you got a new subscriberbtrfs?ZFS is pretty damn nice but the whole ECC ram requirement\recommendation (depending on who is writing documentation) is a bit of a problem.<i>One thing for sure, You always face problems while booting from a device formatted using FAT32 system!</i>exFAT is generally fine for ANY non-system drive, never use fat32 unless you&#39;re going somewhere where you have no clue of the computers available, or where you&#39;re only once or such, and therefore would not justify the POSSIBLE need to install stuffnice video, turtle man...<br />generally fat32 should never be used for actual files, unless it&#39;s the only option, otherwise it&#39;s mostly just preference, such as which OS, or personal preference<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=6m18s">6:18</a> HSF+, HSF Extended instead of HFS.I mis-see the thumbnail as NSFW and extra Fat hahaYo, super dope video. Not sure if it was mentioned in the commenters but wanted to share that ZFS has been ported to MacOS (https://openzfsonosx.org) and works fairly well. I fell down that rabbit hole some time ago. I‚Äôd recommend a hackintosh with beefy specs or a souped-up early model Mac Pro (4,1 or later) to get enough hard drives mounted for ZFS to matter. Great setup for musicians photographers and videographers who need a fast, stable and reliable data storage server running on OSX. Peace.I am in awe of how much Chris delivered in 11 minutes.<br /><br /><br /> There are quite a few other file systems available for Linux (you would be surprised), but very few ordinary users (like me) would have any reason to know of their existence (other than btrfs, which openSuse defaults to for its installation), except for their vociferous fans. Some &quot;advanced&quot; mode installations offer them, or at least they used to.<br /><br /><br />Android has it own file system (which I don&#39;t know what it is called) on which it resides, even though Android uses a modified Linux kernel, and you would naturally expect ext4. Ordinarily its identity is inaccessible from within Android. The only way you would know it is something different is if you have Android on an SD card (for instance), as with a SBC, and you look at it with a Linux utility.<br /><br /><br /> Unlike Linux, Microsoft creations, like NTFS, are not entirely (or not at all) openly documented, so accessibility of NTFS on Linux is really &quot;reverse engineering.&quot; (And MS adds to the complex internals of NTFS as it will.) Although the accessibility has been around since far in the past, it took years before writing to NTFS was judged trustable to Linux standards. To this day if you change anything on an NTFS file system, Linux marks it as needing checking, and Windows will check it when  it boots. (I write to NTFS from Linux a lot and have never had a problem.)<br /><br /><br />OTOH, it is not worth the effort to MS to have accessibly to EXT4, even though it is completely documented, and MS is recently touting themselves as &quot;Linux friendly.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I am sure if Apple wished to supply open source code to any file system of theirs, the Linux side would be happy to accept.Thank you!How much space does a FATA55 take up? :)Thank you a lot. Been confused which to choose for my SD-cards and external drives. Problem now solved.Some light shed on BTRFS and XFS would have been truly appreciated. Nevertheless, great video!Chris, one BIG mistake - Linux system drive is ANY file system you want, ext4 is NOT a mandatory choice as stated around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=7m55s">7:55</a>Your vids are always a pure gold, cheers!What about btrfsReiserFSHow can I know this just now.

I would also recommend to investigate UDF (&quot;Universal Disk Format&quot;, see Wikipedia). It can be used on CD/DVD(rw) but also on block devices (usb/sd). It is compatible with Mac OSX, Windows and Linux. On Linux you can format with command: # mkudffs -b 512 --utf8 --media-type=hd --vid=&quot;name&quot; /dev/sdX1Excellent as always. A nice follow up would be file servers, as in NAS, SMB and other protocols. To some extent these abstract away from the file systems tech.What about Btrfs? Is it an improvement over ext4?Sir, I want to ask you something. when I tried to connecting my 1TB external hard drive to my phone using a USB On The Go adapter, it asked me to reformat it. is it because my phone can&#39;t support NTFS format? if it is, what format should I reformat it to be compatible with my phone? or is it even necessary? what should I do? <br />thanks in advance.ur a god amongst menwhat are disk volumes?what do you think about water cooling??? thanksif chris dies who will tell us about computers and how will we knowGreat content... Kindly click the like and subscribe button and share this info.I was hoping the actual drive formatting structure would be shown how each were different.Sadly, there was no comment in the video regarding the artificial limitation Microsoft introduced  to the FAT32 file system, stopping Windows from formatting drives with FAT32 when the drive size is 32GB or larger. Originally, this was an attempt to push NTFS, which was - at the time - not readable or writeable by any other OS. Furthermore, I can&#39;t see a big advantage of exFAT over FAT32, aside from the ability to store more than 4 GB in a single file. But it was, again a clever move by Microsoft. Here again, a new file system that was - at the time - not compatible with anything else than Microsoft&#39;s Windows was introduced and by becoming the official file system for SDXC media, Microsoft was able to control who got official access to its proprietary specifications. exFAT integrators were required to pay a fee for using exFAT as well. Today there is a FUSE-based implementation as well as a kernel driver to support exFAT on Linux and some other systems, but due to patent issues, the kernel driver cannot be shipped with the Linux kernel. As a result of these tactics concerning exFAT and SDXC, even today some devices work fine with FAT32 formatted SDXC cards, but don&#39;t work with exFAT formatted ones. So say thanks twice to Microsoft.Nice summary even if it wasn&#39;t 100% correct, it was close enough. Have a thumbs up for your effort. BTRFS would have been a nice inclusion.What a beautiful haircut you have. Where do you cut your hair? I&#39;m going to cut my hair like yours.Super. I know more of this file.great videoI use apfs on all of my hard drivesExcellent video :)This is an excellent video!  And I shared it with the Twitter world! LOL  THANK YOU!!!I had a similar issue just 2 weeks ago. I was creating a Sysprep image of Windows 10 for a customized deployment, and I was creating the DISM image to a 32GB USB. It failed twice, then it hit me, the USB was formatted to FAT32, so I plugged in an SSD formatted to NTFS and directed the DISM image to be created to the SSD, it worked. The customized deployment image was 9+GB. So point is, the original method would have worked if I was using a USB formatted to NTFS.A few mentioned in the comments:<br />NTFS, exFAT, F2FS, HSF+, ext, ext1, , ext2, ext3, ext4, XFS by SGI, APFS Apple Proprietary File System, ReiserFS, FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, REFS (Resilient File System), JFS, ZFS, BTRFS, HPFS.<br />also to mention that i seem to remember I read on internet that not all Linux packages can handle ext4.Hi , Chris , some time doing many things at once - sorry - we are turning the DVD 4.7 into a big floppy drive or like a drive were we can transfer files to and from - question , file sysytem is a udf 2.01 default - we could use 2.50 default which is better to burn the dvd - format the dvd with - 2.01 default or the 2.50 ??? there are no other options to go to any other FAT 32 OR NTFS - THE COMPUTER IS ABOUT 6 YEARS OLD Thank for your helpVery very informative and interesting videoThanks for your effort and time for us.Hi , Chris , have been a fan off and on - ( dvd - has 4.7 gb  ) should they been on NTFS OR  on Fat 32 thanks for any help sincerely - William and Wilma Greenwood&#39;&#39; Ah, you&#39;re an idiot&#39;&#39; ..... that was brilliant !

Thanks.Hey Chris, I‚Äôve been watching your channel for some time and just want to thank you for all the work you‚Äôve done explaining... computers and devices along with software. Besides being informative and entertaining they‚Äôre presented delightfully and plainly enough for everyone to grasp the information you‚Äôre conveying. Thank you!Very informative....!! although i want to know little bit more about REFS (Resilient File System).You forgot gpt format.  Great video regardless.In following your videos, I only occasionally find myself venturing into unfamiliar territory. But even though they, like this one, do not always manage to bring anything new onto the table for me personally. I still find myself having a quite pleasant feeling of greater clarity and oversight afterwards. As if my mind has just gone through some sort of uncluttering process.<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t really matter much, if I don&#39;t learn something new every single time. Because when people sometimes ask me, to some extend related questions, it can be quite tedious to repeatedly give a similar speech. I also can&#39;t help but worry a bit from time to time, about maybe unintentionally having left something crucial out, either by mistake or in an attempt to simplify things. It is therefore very gratifying to instead be able send a link to one or more of your videos, in a sort of &quot;watch some of these and get back to me in the morning&quot; kind of way. Knowing that they will be in good hands with your thorough way of explaining.<br /><br />I have even been able to settle some arguments like that. I especially recall this one about whether or not there were any point in actively cooling a Raspberry Pi 3B+ or not. Everybody seemed to be arguing from their own vague assumptions, bases on their quite different experiences and varied approaches. A simple fight of opinions without anyone contributing with anything tangible, as these things often go. Butting in by simply referring to a couple of your videos on the subject seemed to clear the matter straight up. Or at least the need to continue arguing seemed to just vanish in the presence of some actually hard data.<br /><br />Presenting all this very abstract knowledge to people in a condensed, comprehensible and digestible form, like this... it cannot be an easy task. It does however make this super-nerds life a bit easier in quite a few ways, which is highly appreciated - so thank you.May I add some observations please Christopher. BTRFS is a valid choice for Linux systems and it shares many features with ZFS. exFAT and HFS+ are also supported on Linux.I expected more technical details. Information in this video can be put into one simple table.Thank you for this video. Also interesting to read the comments.Thank you very much for your videos. They are absolutely easy to understand. Both from a linguistic and a technical point of view. And I am German and had my last English lesson thirty years ago. Thumbs up !!!I was actually expecting explanations of technical differences between file systems, how data is actually stored on each type of system, what is the cause of size limitations, etc. Not &quot;this FS1 is for that OS1, that FS2 is for these OS2 and OS3&quot;.... C&#39;mon..FAT has the ability to mark files read-only.  NTFS provides the ability to provide finer control based on privilege.what about the next generation linux filesystem, Btrfs?Nice presentationYou forgot about REFS!This is a really useful video, thanks!I hate computers and programming, but keep on torturing myself by trying to learn new things within these topics. This video was very interesting and informative. Thanks for a great video which made me suffer minimal! :)Yet another brilliant video. Thank you! Started reading your book &quot;Seven Ways to Fix the World&quot;. Some of the perspectives you introduce are unorthodox, which makes it even more interesting and exciting to explore. Cheers for that, too!How the FAT nomenclature (12, 16 and 32) are related to anything?Ntfs came about in 1993 and fat32 came about in 1996. Ntfs was part of nt 3.1.That was a  nice video, well presented to put forward the information contained within it.  Good job!The quality of your videos is always of a very high quality Open University or BBC Four production. Always educational and professionally delivered.  Thank you.Thanks very much.  I really appreciated watching and learning from this.  I found it very useful.I like how you curiously avoided ReiserFS ;)...with good reason.  Although, probably one of the best file systems available on Linux; except for the it no longer being maintained due to &quot;interesting&quot; issues with the original developer....Thanks for the video.  Do you think you will ever do one that gives your opinion on the best OS for the Raspberry Pi 3B+ ????Hi. Nice video, which I can definitely use in my computer class. What you say about having to format a drive to convert it to another file system (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=10m32s">10:32</a>) is not entirely true. FAT / FAT32 to NTFS, e. g. just requires this command: convert drive: /fs:ntfs.<br />Moreover, there are tools to read and write to not natively supported file systems. In macOS you can use FUSE for macOS and / or mounty (<a href="https://mounty.app/)">https://mounty.app/)</a>.ZFS is amazing but it&#39;s a complete paradigm shift, not just any old filesystem that you can just plop on an SD card and plug in. I&#39;m not currently using it because I don&#39;t need it&#39;s advantages vs. the additional management necessary to use it. Also please note BTRFS is not worth dealing with, I lost a bunch of data to it. YMMV I guess.. Anyway if you have professional work loads with lots of volumes  and don&#39;t mind putting in the effort of managing pools I highly recommend diving into the world of ZFSI always use EXT4 on HDDs because auto-defragmentation after every operation keeps my drive running fast, unlike most other filesystems that need to be manually defragmented once they start slowing down ;)<br />not sure if ZFS does auto-defragmentation, but if it has better corruption protection than EXT4 (I&#39;ve never had a severe case aside from my own stupidity, unlike NTFS, buuut the fact my own stupidity caused it means it&#39;s still possible without it, be it far less likely than NTFS), I&#39;m looking forward to using it.<br /><br />EXT3 (not sure about 4 yet) support can be added to Windows, but you need to be a hacker to be able to do it as the process is quite tedious.<br /><br />also, on SSDs and other NAND technoloty, EXT4 doesn&#39;t auto-defrag as that would greatly reduce the SSD&#39;s lifespan, as limited as it is.<br />(I have a 2GB SSD I can&#39;t use for anything besides swap because it&#39;s already dead, returning constant IO Errors under any other filesystem)In the 80&#39;s I was teaching young kids on Amstrad PC&#39;s which had the fat 12 hard drives. these where 40 meg and i remember having to partition them as 32 meg and 8 meg so your article brought that memory back to me.correction<br />FAT32 can store up to 2GiB files (not larger) or 1GiB on Windowswhere is BTRFS?<br />exFAT is very possible on GNU/Linux<br />ZFS is ok on GNU/Linux, as long as you are fine with either tainted Linux Kernel or FUSE (Filesystem in UserSpace)Thank you for sharing very important information!Excellent! Great and useful explanation, especially the differences in the fat versions.I have 3 2TB SSD drives which I&#39;d like to use as a singular partition on a Windows system.<br />Is there a way for me to set their file-system in a way that would later allow me to use them in a Linux system?<br /><br /><br />If that isn&#39;t possible, can I just have them set as NTFS spanned-volumes, and when necessary, read them through WINE on Linux?Amazing and very informative video as always. But I think you missed Btrfs it&#39;s Gaining popularity, lately.What about btrfs?I like your videos because they are concise, well explained to a degree non-technical people can understand, and the style of fonts logos and other materials presented in 80&#39;s PC themes. Thanks a lot for the hard work you put in, keep it going.I think I&#39;ll choose ZFS for my Win98 build.  Kidding aside, I&#39;m pretty sure I remember something funny from my days in IT (around 1999-2006) when installing Win98 (making images and upgrading thousands of machines from &#39;95).  During those pretty install screens where messages and some info would flash by every few seconds, I could swear it talked about using the (then) &quot;new&quot; file system Fat32.. for drives up to <b>2 TB.</b>  lol.  This was in 2001, when 6 GB drives were the norm.  Looking back on it now, the idea of formatting a 2 TB drive with Fat32 is madness.  No, for that, I use the *&quot;new technology&quot; file system.  Cutting edge stuff.Typo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=4m44s">4:44</a>.  NTFS, you put NFTS.  Just in case you cared.  Good video, though. I enjoyed it.Well. I never tried 16Tb. But i got working 8Tb/Fat32 at 64k. But most important it&#39;s MBR. And why? For compatibility with my PS3. Well it&#39;s kind hard and almost impossible. You gonna need extra hardware for that to working.Would be nice to hear, how these work in detail.3rd party software can be used in Windows to format drives bigger than 32 GB in FAT32. This is how you get a 64GB SD card to work in a Nintendo 3DS.Very interesting Video! Thank you!Thanks for that great overview, presented in your always easy to understand way!Good quick overview.  Thank you very much.NTFS is difficult to network share on linuxBrilliant! Totally brilliant presentation! Everything is now - at last - clear concerning different filesys... Thanks!Tried ZFS today, so easy to create a raid works great.<br />Thanks for the video and idea.Thank you so much for explaining this! Googling this when in a hurry when you&#39;re new to Linux or want to format an old usb leads to forums which leads to opinions which leads to....well I&#39;m sure you know üòÖMissed btrFS, the new kid on the block.NiceThanks.This has some interesting information about probability of files copied from DNC servers being local or from a place overseas like Russia: <a href="https://youtu.be/MSAN5CRzG-A">https://youtu.be/MSAN5CRzG-A</a>Another good vid that carves knowledge, you may have already known to an extent, but carves it into your mind in a neatly presented fashion that you&#39;ll not forget with facts/pointers that will remind you of the benefits &amp; limitations of formatting to any particular filing system. I generally knew the Windows related systems, using FAT32 or exFAT for small portable storage, but I knew nothing of the Mac or Linux systems that I may need to know for the future.Thank you for this simple explanation. This made me realize how I wanted to do same as explained in the end of the video and couldn&#39;t.Please one video on motherboard vrm&#39;sYou can convert without loosing data in some cases. Windows allows FAT32 to NTFS convert without losing data (using convert.exe). You can also use a 3rd party partition manager software to accomplish that.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=2m46s">2:46</a> When NTFS came in 1993, it wasn&#39;t to overcome the limitations of FAT32 because FAT32 was not yet released back then. NTFS was an alternative to FAT16, both were options to choose when installing Windows NT.Formating in NTFS wasn&#39;t even available during install back then. When you had to do was choose to have your system partition converted from FAT16 to NTFS right after Window NT had been installed. That&#39;s why until Windows 2000? or XP? (don&#39;t remember), the boot partition could never be more than 4GB.<br />Also, the read-only attribute wasn&#39;t new for NTFS. FAT had it too; what NTFS introduced was a whole new systems of permissions (allow/deny/etc) bound to all kinds of users (individually).what about LVM i would be grateful if you explain that file system :Dkinda basic. didn&#39;t even mention other honorable FS like XFS  or the obscure ones...  Reiser, I&#39;m looking at youHappy to see a new video of yours.Never ever trust FAT32 for partitions of 32GB or above -- when data exceeds 32GB, it can experience a data-wrapping error that can make files just vanish. This is a known bug (and why Win98&#39;s FDISK had that limit)  and was explained in Microsoft&#39;s Knowledge Base, back before they nuked all the older pages.Some additional info to your last statement: It is possible to convert FAT## volumes to NTFS (see Windows command &quot;convert&quot; for more info) whithout data loss if the volume serves enough free space for conversion. This is very handy when you have a &gt;64 GB flash drive formatted with FAT32 and try to place a big file on it, it has fooled me around quite a lot ^^Am confused why you say need ext4 for linux? I have systems on btrfs on one device and xfs on another.  <br />You can have what you like grub boots from loads of FSsWe need a file system that supports permissions, has a high file size limit, and is compatible across Linux, Android, and Windows natively. Honestly, this could be fixed with Microsoft just releasing an update to support ext4 drives.it is a good refresher for me , great video. thanksWhat is the best format to keep a pen drive formatted to get best speed on 3.0 interface.Excellent explanation. +1 subGreat informationSomeday, BTRFS‚ù§Ô∏èUh, read-only is an attribute even old FAT16 supported. That was not introduced with NTFS. I really couldn&#39;t continue after hearing that.This video definitely simplified my life. Now I can narrow my focus to NTFS for my SSD boot drive, and exFAT for my flash drives. <br />Thanks.Nice walkthrough<br />Thanks for sharingüòÄüëçAdditional note on file system robustness and reliability.   Based on years in I.T., the last job was ten years in a shop that uses hundreds of Macs for workstations.<br />FAT and FAT variants are fairly reliable, but will occasionally corrupt a file.  Recovery is generally possible and file system repair usually possible.<br />NTFS is robust and reliable, but when it breaks, it breaks hard and recovery/repair is about a 50/50 possibility.<br />EXT4 is very robust and almost never corrupts a file.  Repair and recovery in those rare cases is almost always successful.<br />ZFS is solid.  I&#39;ve never run into problems with it.<br />HFS+ is the worst file system ever created.  It regularly corrupts files and recovery is rarely successful.  80% of the problems I fixed on mac workstations involved using a 3rd party utility to repair the file system.<br />APFS came out just after I left the last job, so I have no direct experience with it and can&#39;t offer any opinion.Around 7 minutes.   correction.  Ubuntu and most distros based on ubuntu have had read-only support for HFS+ for awhile now.  Root user can write to it if it&#39;s journaling was turned off under osx first. Other debian based distros can obtain it by installing hfsprogs from the repos.Thanks Chris, I appreciate the update.  I am using Windows 7 and trying to get my data all set to move to Windows 10.  While doing backups I thought something was not right so upon further testing I found two of my disk drives were failing.  I purchased two more but had to go through the exercise of recalling all these formats.  This video was a helpful reminder.  I know you will say I should have moved to solid state drives but heck, I do not mind the load times and what do I know anyhow being I never used solid state before and just found the deal on disk drives too good to refuse.  This also has allowed me to afford and set up cloud storage on my whole system so I now have two if not three backup solutions.  I am totally safe for the first time.<br /><br /><br />Thank you for all you do!<br /><br /><br />Richit&#39;s zee not zed lol jkThank you. Very informative as usual. One day I hope you consider explaining how to program a home router for maximum network protection.Excellent videoAnother masterpiece from you sir may your victories multiplyGreat video!What about f2fs? It&#39;s gaining momentum in Android phones, and every year more and more Linux distributions surport it.Been curious about looking this up recently. Couldn&#39;t be happier to see you publish a video on this your content and explanations are always top notchThanks you for refresh my memory. I want to add a little clarification. ZFS is ZettaByte File System <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS</a> .Quote: The name at one point was said to stand for &quot;Zettabyte File System&quot;, but by 2006 was no longer considered to be an abbreviation. A ZFS file system can store up to 256 quadrillion zettabytes (ZB). <a href="https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Zettabyte+File+System">https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Zettabyte+File+System</a> .Quote: ZFS (1) (Zettabyte File System) A distributed file system from Sun that was added to OpenSolaris in 2005 and Solaris 10 in 2006.With support for 128 bits, compared to 64 for NTFS and other contemporary file systems, storage capacity is unlimited for all practical purposes, which is the reason for the &quot;zettabyte&quot; name.Too bad you didn&#39;t spoke about xfs, or betterfsFUSE?Nice video for learningThank Sir, I appreciated for you.nice one.No love for HPFS???4;51: NFTS ü§î  NTFS :-)Nice refresh of file systems. I would suggest a follow up regarding the legal characters you can use for the filenames in every operating system, more and more people are swapping between operating systems and I noticed a different behaviour of OS es regarding &quot;special characters&quot;. If you stay in plain ascii no problem.<br />With Regards,<br />EricWhoa, I thought this would be a TechQuickie video, for some reason. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s not, actually.Few things.<br /><br />If you have a FAT32 and want to go to NTFS, you do not need to format.<br />The old &quot;Convert&quot; utility still exists in windows which allows you to convert FAT32 to NTFS.<br /><br />You should have mentioned UDF.<br /><br />I use it since all 3 major OS&#39;s have native read/write support for it.<br /><br />Android does not natively support exFAT.<br />Since exFAT needs a licensing fee, stock android does not give support for it, mobiles from samsung do but that is because they paid for the licensing fee to use exFAT.What about ReFS?Thank uou for refreshing my memory and adding some new knowledge as well.Isn&#39;t it Zettabyte FileSystem?While exfat does require drivers on Linux, they are easily available, which makes it a great choice if you share drives between Windows, Mac, as well as LinuxAlso, the numbers in early FAT systems were determining the maximum filename size. So for FAT12, you could have 8 letter name, dot and file extension (for example AUTOEXEC.BAT). This was used from beginning in MS-DOS and other DOS-based systems. So that also means, old FAT file systems had limited options for very long names for files, so that&#39;s the reason, why you couldn&#39;t put super long name in your MS-DOS or DOS-based system.Thanks Chris!<br />Got the latest Linux Mint 19.1! BIG improvement over 18.X! Live boot to desk top in ~10 sec! Still learning how to manually install software into it from a tarball. Cheers!<b>blkid</b> in the Linux terminal shows you file type if anyone didn&#39;t knowWindows 10 had an new filesystem called &quot;Resilient File System (ReFS)&quot;, But since an update it no long shows, The only option now is NTFSMost external devices like media systems, car sat navs and many cameras still seem to only accept FAT 32.exFAT has hugh file size allocation the minimum is 4mb where ntfs has a minimum of 4kb ( in windows )Didn&#39;t think you would cover ZFS, glad you did.  Not sure if you mentioned it and I missed it.  ZFS is very great, but its DDR demands are great as well.  You need 8GB just to join the party, then 1GB for every TB of storage.  It isn&#39;t totally unlikely to have over 50TB of storage  so easily you will have over 60GB of DDR4.  DDR is as cheap as it is ever going to get so I will probably but now to have it available.   I&#39;d be looking at something around ¬£300 for the memory to fund a NAS, plus the HDD (a SSD for a boot drive although freeNAS is really pretty good about not crashing and being light on resources.  You can, and really should use ECC memory, that is cheap second hand and painful new.  New you can get from China but reports suggest buyer beware, it is cheap, it will generally work, but you rarely get what you expect. .I thank you for the reliable quality of contentChromeOS ?Good to see a quick summary of the basic facts.  Just a few additional facts.<br />NTFS can be either open source, or Microsoft.  Each is different, in regards to small details.  I prefer Microsoft NTFS, using the partition in NTFS-compressed format.  Compressed format allows faster reading from spinning HDD&#39;s, if you have CPU &amp; memory power to spare.<br />On spinning HDD&#39;s, defragmentation of the clusters is important.  Too much defragging - slows down reading &amp; writing speeds.  Also, it is difficult to recover deleted or damaged files if the clusters are too defragmented.  Defragmenting is needed for all HDD&#39;s for all partition types:  Ext, Fat32, NTFS, etc.  Defragmenting on flash drives &amp; SSD&#39;s is not needed &amp; not recommended.  It is not recommended, because these two electronic drives have no physically moving parts, but &quot;wear out&quot; due to the very high limit on number of electronic read-writes. <br />Sometimes Fat32 partitions can be used on drives of most kinds which are bigger than 4 GB.  This works very well &amp; reliably.  Sometimes exFat USB sticks might seem hard to use in booting.  It depends on the choice of booting: UEFI or Legacy (older).AAA+ YouTube video for explaining file systems!  Wonderful.Thank you for video explanation. This is good for different uses.Chris! ¬† Sorry, but my official language is portuguese Brazil<br />Congrats on your videos. They are very explanatory, easy to understand.<br />I ask you, if possible, to make video about possible stuttering that occurs in SSD and how to solve it. Thanks!That was a stupendously wonderful video! You really cleared up some questions for me.  I&#39;m an audio engineer. A lot of people think I know about computers because... well... I started building my own custom computers in, 1995. And being an audio engineer and technician. I&#39;ve always made good decisions. And my decisions seem to align well with yours.  And that was very helpful to this, old audio technician. That I got it right. The first time.  I like to be like that. I&#39;m pretty good with people like that. And I&#39;ll sleep well tonight, thanks to you. I love your channel! Actually it&#39;s more your accent to Americans. That we love. The most.  To Americans. Makes you sound very sophisticated and intelligent. Even if you&#39;re a dummy? I&#39;d buy it anyhow. You&#39;re that good! You got me fooled so I can sleep tonight. That works for me.

Why not move on to somthing more modern?hfs and hfs+ is recognised in linux (popOS, Ubuntu and Solus), but other than that great video!Does those different file formats also has to do something with deviding the memory into smaller sections, for instance fat 1 devides the memory into sections of 4MB sothat in case i just waste 1 byte of data on it,that fat1 one will interpret the 4MB of space as fully used, while fat 2 may devide it into sections of 2 MB sothat in case you wasted just 1byte of data on it, you will have more space left,<br />Now what if theres a fat format wich will devide the momety into sections of 1byte, then you no longer have to worry of running out of space that quick,haha<br /><br />But i guess money is also a thing,maybe those flashcard companys wants you to run out of space to buy now flash cards, hence they will not implement the best format into their chips by default.I have a few nasty memories of losing power during  disk access on a Windows 95 (OSR2) machine and rebooting to the dreaded &quot;Operating system not found&quot; message. Never had this happen with an NTFS machine.HFS by my understanding is a UNIX file system standard(POSIX?), not apple. I am old mainframer (40+ years) IBM Z/Os operating system in USS/OMVS/UNIX kinda-sorta environment have HFS as on option and have so for decades.Thanks  !One of my favorite teachers, I have seen a lot of videos and read a lot about SD-WAN. Trying to understand real meaning, but not sure what is really, yet. I think nobody could give us a better explaining video than you. Looking forward. Thank you for your knowledge and time! JohnNo love for Btrfs?@ExplainingComputers <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ExplainingComputers">#ExplainingComputers</a> i was hoping Resilient File System (ReFS) was going to be mentioned too, maybe a video on Windows &quot;Storage Spaces&quot;, hint hint, wink wink, thanks for the videoaround 2000-2008 I ran large Linux servers for ftp / fileservers, and started testing various filesystems because ext2 wasn&#39;t the most reliable after a corruption, ReiserFS was ok but still awkward in a way, the best FS I found then was XFS by SGI. I think ext4 was catching up pretty well and I finally used that one. I always wondered how these FS avoid the typical Windows FS problem of fragmentation - being too lazy to read up on that topic myself, I was hoping you would shed some light on this problem. Maybe a topic for a future video.Thank you Prof. Another great video from you as usual, I first met what seemed at the time to be strange ext2 on Red Hat linux in the late 90s, I was a windows user. It can be quite scary when one meets these different FS, I&#39;m this video will go a long way to helping others.If you are using only GNU/Linux systems (and not Android, btw), I think you should use XFS (which is also Extended File System), (and ZFS in the future). I mean I use ZFS for HDD, SSD, flash storage cards, thumbdrives...<br /><br />XFS is better than EXT4 if you see benchmarks.<br />Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and most of the distributions use EXT4 by default. OpenSUSE use BtrFS by default, but RedHat use XFS by default, which is great.<br />FAT and NTFS has fragmentation problem, which shouldn&#39;t be used if you use only GNU/Linux systems!!Great coverage of this topic. Thank you!Thank you!You enlighten what i was searching for long time. Hats off. Grow nourished and healthy.Not even mentioned ISO9660 and its various extension.<br /><br />Then you have some Linux distros that default to btrfs, and pretty much any distro can support btrfs even if it would not use that as default.  Then you have the more exotic options like nilfs, or f2fs, xfs, jfs, and RieserFS (yes, I know RieserFS is somewhat dated now), and this is just on Linux.<br /><br />OK, I know you had to draw the line somewhere (and even I left out as many as I included), but the omission of ISO9660 does seem significant (albeit, nobody is going to want to format a magnetic disk or SSD to ISO9660, but they could want to mount and read devices that are formatted ISO9660).<br /><br />At one stage many were talking about btrfs supplanting ext4 as the default on all Linux distros, but so far it still does not seem to have reached an adequate level of stability for that.<br /><br /><br />Then there is the problem of patents on exFAT, which is why it still does not have as universal support and one would wish for removable media.There is a typo for &quot;NTFS&quot; on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=4m51s">4:51</a> . Good video!!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=2m54s">2:54</a> &quot;So in practice there is no file size constraints&quot;<br />Yeah, in 2050 we probably have video files at 30 exa bytes :-PMinor correction, NTFS did not introduce Read-only option over FAT file system.  That option existed in all version of FAT file systems and in addition also had a Hidden and System flags.  What NTFS introduced was fine control of what file/directory access rights any particular user account had. BTW, the FAT file system was initially very similar to an earlier CP/M file system but whereas in CP/M cluster allocation was stored within file name entries, the FAT file system had a separate area to store cluster block usage, called File Allocation Table.  For safety there were two copies of it.Absolutely well explained, as always. Just a question: besides OS/2, is there any way to read HPFS in Mac OS X?Thanks. Didn&#39;t know about ZFSGreat cumulative information.Hello mister Clark Kent.also to note about file systems is that (i never played with a Mac) you only have De-fragmentation on Windows and that does not Exist on Linux! (apparently the File system leaves space between files expecting them to grow... Evidently Steam Did not exist when they made that choice... updates 20+ games many times a month lol.)tip: if you ever hit size limit on a FAT32 drive on windows and too lazy to backup &amp; format, try this command: &#39;CONVERT X:/FS:NTFS&#39; where &#39;X:&#39; is the FAT32 drive. This command will convert the file system to NTFS while keeping existing files.Great video. What about BTRFS? Is it dead or still out there?Amazing video!!! Absolutely love itGreat video Chris! Was pleased to see you mention Apple in the mix. I&#39;m computer agnostic, running Linux, Windows and MacOS so end up needing to consider file systems from time to time. The oldest hardware I have is running Linux, and is none other than a 2006 17&quot; Apple MacBook Pro, no longer supported by MacOS, but still Intel based hardware that just doesn&#39;t want to die. I&#39;d love to see what projects you might have for obsolete Apple Hardware...I think you missed one. NTFS also offers &quot;alternate data streams&quot; with each file, making indexing, searches, security options, details on past file access, all integral to the file. I don&#39;t think exFAT offers that. Or any FAT.Good and simple explain,<br />Thanks so muchI was surprised that ISO-9660 was omitted because so many OS installers and live boot systems use it.  And <b>everyone</b> (save pre-1990 retro systems) supports it.No talk of btrfs?very good stuff Amazing Video.....Great stuff, but it might be good to follow up with some of the lesser known file systems people are mentioning in the comments.Very informative video! BTW, I went on a diet and now I&#39;m exFAT!Please upload your content to bitchute before everything is purged off yotube to protect the feelings of socialistsI have found that when I am having problems with accessing files in Windows, I can often clone them on to an EXFAT drive and in doing so all the file controls, etc. will be gone.¬† I can then access them.¬† It has saved me a number of times.I have been in IT for nearly 50 years and despite your usual excellent videos, I am no wiser about how any of these multiple systems actually store data on the disks. With IBM 2311,2319,3330 and 3350 I knew about the physical make up of the disks and could optimise block sizes etc according to cylinders/tracks etc. I am amazed that there are so many incompatible file storage types and capacities for each O/S. What a complete mess, why didn‚Äôt some standards organisation fix the format eons ago!NTFS was released well before FAT32.  The introduction of NTFS was to overcome FAT16, not FAT32grow some beardTimely information, I&#39;ve just bought my first USB flash drive over 32 GB and will be formatting it exFAT shortly.Windows 10 1903 can read Linux file system in explorer but only limited too WSL distros, i hope in the future it can support linux file systemThe 4GB file size limit rules out FAT32 for modern computing.  It&#39;s interesting that modern smart devices like LG TVs only accept NTFS or FAT32 which makes it difficult to use exFAT on USB devices.This video filled in alot of gaps I had in my knowledge about file systems.  Thanks!Chris, thank you.  <br />However, I do have a few bones to pick.  ZFS = Zetabyte File System. It is only on Solaris OS.  OpenZFS is on the operating systems you mentioned, along with FreeNAS.  Nota Bene:. Sun Microsystems was bought by Oracle a few years back.  <br />What about Btrfs?  All of my new Linux installs are done with Btrfs.  In fact OpenSuSI uses it except for /home.  <br />Do keep up the good work.  Thanks again.  <br />PeterHello Chris. üëãüèª<br />What a beautiful way to defragment and refresh my nonvolatile memory with the file systems facts. üòÅ <br />Never enough of learning/refreshing knowledge. The beauty of learning. ü§©Most informative, i keep learning every day. Thank you......Thank you sir. I&#39;ve spent 40 years in IT and I have not seen a better explanation of the file systems. I wish you were around when I had to struggle with the bloody flash drives in the past.  Rock on my friendI recommend exFAT for all SD and sticks regardless of its capacity.Very good!My home system uses ext4, but my work system uses ZFS for the system drive, as does my home file server and work servers. I&#39;ve been thinking about using zfs for my desktop system as well since it has really good, efficient backup capability and redundancy.Great video Chris very useful.... btw send a hello to MR. Sissors :)What is ext8? Or did I miss that filetype in the video. Good video; always a learning experience.<br />Today, a week later, I noticed that the ext8 filetype was from the video title and description. Pretty tricky!Helpful video. APFS as the first partition, NTFS on the second, Ext4 on the third. FAT32 on the flash card as a conduit to move data between each OS. Nothing better than Hackintosh to force learning about file systems.Thank you, Professor.  As always, informative and entertaining;  I always await your next video.You didn&#39;t mention XFS. It&#39;s default on some linux distros. It&#39;s also used by NASA :PSurprised that neither btrfs nor f2fs got a mention. There&#39;s also GlusterFS but that&#39;s not relevant for most people.One downside of extFAT is that it seems to have very coarse modified times, which has caused me problems with torrenting and in comparing multiple copies of data.Forgot Solaris as an OS for ZFSWhat about ReFS for Windows? Or btrfs for Linux? Great video nonetheless.Very helpful, thank you :O)You made the file system more clear than I have ever been able to understand it in a short time. Thank you very much Mr Barnatt.  I&#39;m building your budget computer system with minor upgrades, thanks ! :-)We need some sort of Unified File System or standardization for files across Mac, Windows, and Linux!Anybody miss FAT?Another brilliant video, thanks a million. It is well presented and well explained, all the best. Again, thank you, thank you, thank you  üôÇTwo weeks ago I added Win10 to my Ubuntu system... I had first formatted my USB with Fat32 to install Windows on it and it failed...So I have done it again with NTFS and it was a success...Now I understand why :-)  ... nice videoSpeaking of format.

Thank you !They have to homologate all the different versions of FAT filesystem and rule the latest one as standard with backward compatibility with older devices to avoid all those confusions, example it&#39;s compatible flag wise and index wise but there is an append file that only exFat which is the more recent version use while other versions ignore this file since they do not support it.F2FS? XFS?Regardless of the quality of information (which is great btw), this channel has the best video production on the web. Thank you!Awesome! I&#39;ve always wondered what those file systems are all about. Thanks! üòäCan you do a video on the history of MFM, IDE, SCSI, SATA, and what might come next?Thanks for demystifying this cornucopia of file systems and all the incompatibilities that occur. Much appreciated.thanksbtrfs obsolete?This was very informative and even though I knew most of the informations as I&#39;ve had my own problems with things like FAT32 size limit or how to read an NTFS external drive on Android, I still enjoyed it a lot and having all the information in one complete video was great !Always thought NTFS meant New Type of FAT System. Silly me, also I had same trouble about the file system on memory cards. for ages I used FAT32 on my 32gb microsd. I just recently found out my phones can use exFAT and that opened up  whole new possibilities for me and the phone! Been doing non official IT work for 20 years (I&#39;m 30 years old at the time of this comment) and still learning from these videos.‚ù§Ô∏èI use SWAP FS on everything lolWonderful and concise explanation of something that had  my head spinning after starting to work with Windows/Mac/Linux systems routinely.Thank You.I often have to provide video files on USB sticks or portable drives for customers.  So that they can play directly on PC, Mac and modern TVs, I nearly always use NTFS.  But then Mac users can&#39;t write data to the drive unless they install Tuxera or similar NTFS write software.  This is a right pain.  If I selected exFAT, most TVs (some Panasonic models excepted) can&#39;t read it.  If I chose HFS+ then no TVs can read it, nor can PCs, so that would be a poor choice for an archive format (bearing in mind how bad Apple are at supporting anything they consider to be legacy).  If only Macs could natively write to NTFS, life would be much simpler.You made it so clear and easy to understand, thank you üëçI missed ZFS! üò≠üò≠üò≠It‚Äôs always exciting to view your latest video and I often feel as though you are speaking directly to me, especially when I hear things like, ‚ÄúAhh, you‚Äôre an idiot!‚Äù :-) Thanks for the seemingly endless wealth of useful information!Excellent, never really put much thought into the subject, but now I&#39;m aware.

Long ago i did tests NTFS vs. ext4 and i liked more NTFS power off protection, ext4 was a bit faster, but if power goes away, files being moved become lost... ext2fsd software allows to r&amp;w ext4 in windows machines flawless, if Not in uni-8 but default, to r&amp;w hfs+ needs a paid software... WinXP needs a paid software to r&amp;w NTFS if i remember correctly, OSX can read NTFS, but Not Write, its a pain... but maybe loads &amp; writes ext4, cant remember. same machine OSX seems faster... less bloated. OSX its like a closed source FreeBSD, also brother of PS4... same mother, different father. The Best way to have compatibility is using a bridge, like exFAT or Ethernet File Sharing.

Most helpful!XFS and Btrfs could have been mentioned.Very informative!I&#39;m so confued..Modern Linux distros like Opensuse are using BTRFS as default file System ‚Ä¶ and there is no mention of this ?That&#39;s a healthy thumbs-up to thumbs-down ratio!  Nice one!U r the starChristopher, I have a specific question regarding file systems.  For a Tandy 1000 SL/3, (the upgraded version with the 40mb hdd more ram and faster cpu)  The HDD has failed.  I want to replace it with a flash storage option, so IDE to flash card.  I have an 8gb flash card.  Natively the system supports FAT16, can I change this to FAT32 so the card will read as one drive?OK i did not read all comments but on exFAT slide you have mistake.  Yes our brains can do wonderful  things like ECC :)  NFTS  should be NTFS.This explains almost everything. That exFAT always boggled me.Can I flash std usb with exFat format ?Can exFat formatted drive be , used on standalone devices like TV&#39;s with like old os i.e. not android std TV&#39;s ? And if formatted with fat32 or exFat changes the read and write speed ?Once again, an excellent explanation! Your channel is invaluable. Keep up the great work because it&#39;s highly appreciated!More excellent information for just about any computer user. File system type should be more commonly known than it is, thanks for another great video Chris.that&#39;s why when you install windows and linux together the Linux partision will not show up in Windows, becasue Linux uses exFAT which is not supported in WindowsI&#39;m just starting to get into the real components of how a OS functions, so this came in super handy. Excellent explanation, easy to understand and very well articulated. Thank you so much and greetings from Venezuela!You didin&#39;t mention the Legacy systems  DOS:  Fat8 and FAT16  (Floppy disks still use them),  for Apple  Before HFS was MFS  (used on the original Macintosh)  not to mention ProDOS  used on the old Apple II.  Also Atari Amiga and Commodore used even OTHER ones....but that is another story :)Thanks for explaining this. Very good. Sorted out my SD cards for my cameras. Wish you could come around mine and sort my pc out which freezes no matter what OS I put on (Windows 10, Linux) .Great summary. Thanks!Chris, great video as always. Small correction: NTFS was not a reaction to Fat32 - it originated in Windows NT 4.  Prior versions of NT used HPFS, which came from OS2. NTFS was an evolution of HPFS. Win 2000 was (i believe) the first MS OS that could natively support NTFS and Fat32.Hi Would you recommend NTFS for a 5tb usb 3  hardrive?A very informative videos as usual.

Suggest you re-record or use a noise reduction plug-in to eliminate it.Thanks for the refresher, I have forgotten a lot of this material. Having gone through Apples  service Tech training back in the late 80‚Äôs I found out very quickly that Apple was driven to go there own way.

Lots of important  and up to date information.Ive written routines to deal with FAT12/16/32 in assembler for both PIC micro and Z80, I found a white paper on it from Microsoft which was very clear on how to implement it.

Thanks!<br />Too bad that ext4 is not supported by Windows system. For me, the issue with Windows has done anyway. Since when update madness of Windows 10 can not be switched off. I did everything from win 3.11 to win7 and I never did any update for that. Linux is the answer for the future (for me), and Windows (Rest in peace) is burying itself.Perhaps should have mentioned which filesystems out of those are proprietary and don&#39;t like to share their secrets so others can have the benefit of compatibility with them. And which ones are open yet refused to be supported.i use Linux, my root is formatted as JFS, home is XFS .  I would love for OpenZFS to be fully adopted at one point.  Also, F2FS is Samsung&#39;s NAND Flash based FS, which I have also been playing with.  I would love Linux to support that for installing on for SSDs.Worth adding info about cameras and formatting their cards, as they often generate video files in excess of 4 gigabytes and wind up getting stuck into computers.I can maybe understand why most Linux distros don&#39;t have native support for HFS, HFS+, or APFS, but I find it somewhat baffling that macOS 10+, being UNIX-based has never had native support for ext2, 3, or 4.XFS ZFS and JFS are far superiorMr. Barnatt...<br /><br />You have delivered another EXCELLENT technical tutorial in a concise manner!!<br /><br />When I entered the personal computer industry in 1983, most learning was via self-teaching and trial and error. There were NO Christopher Barnatt types openly sharing their knowledge. <br /><br />Thanks for sharing your time and knowledge with all the young (and not so young) eager learners in the world.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />T.<br />Phoenix, AZ USAThanks,there were lots of unknowns there to myself.There&#39;s a very specific usage case for formatting a USB stick in FAT32 - cheaper DVD drives are hard-coded to only read that format. If you want to use a stick with a modern capacity, larger than 32GB  - who wouldn&#39;t? - you can format it with a freeware thing called formatfat32.exe (just Google it). There&#39;s no technical reason why FAT32 should be limited to 32GB, it&#39;s a Microsoft &quot;cos we say so&quot;. If you&#39;re going to do this, remember also that the bulletproof video file format for DVD players is AVI (and take care not to encode individual files to be larger that 4GB).<br />I have twenty years of my favourite TV show (bet you can&#39;t guess which) on a 256GB stick that lives in my DVD player, ready to go. Hope this is helpful - I learned it the hard way...Very helpful video!  The little lightbulb over my head just went on!  That explains problems I&#39;ve had in the past when trying to add files to a large zip file.For tape drive users, there&#39;s LTFS (Linear Tape File System) which allows files in tape drives to be accessed normally like other storage medias (no more sequential access needed)No mention of Btrfs and XFS?<br />Btrfs is better than ext4 in almost all cases.Where‚Äôs the butter?

I need the encryption.thank you for the useful info. really thanksGood information! A couple of small corrections:<br /><br />The video implies Apple&#39;s HFS isn&#39;t natively supported by Linux, however there is a HFS driver in the Linux kernel (though from memory it&#39;s read-only).<br /><br />I don&#39;t believe Linux can read APFS formatted drives out of the box, though there is a buildable FUSE module that can be used to read APFS. I expect it will be merged into the kernel eventually:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=APFS-Development-For-Linux">https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=APFS-Development-For-Linux</a><br /><br />ZFS has been ported to both Apple OS X and Microsoft Windows, though it seems the Windows port is still pretty rough:<br /><br /><a href="https://openzfsonosx.org/">https://openzfsonosx.org/</a><br /><a href="https://openzfsonwindows.org/">https://openzfsonwindows.org/</a>I&#39;ve been struggling with portable drives.<br />Formatted NTFS, in my experience they don&#39;t share well. Users and groups have GUIDs, and apart from some well known ones, they are indeed unique. Chris on his Windows notebook has a different GUID from Chris on his home PC and both are different from Chris at work.<br /><br />I have not yet discovered the magic formula for carrying my work around on the portable drive.<br /><br />Formatted exFAT might work better, but my standard Linux computers choke on it.You was saying about full format to a new file system and loosing files. Is there a program that can copy the files to RAM (assuming you have enough) and then copy back to newly formatted file system?Thanks, my British mate.<br /> This was very useful.<br /><br />These are the typical things I want to know more of. Cheers!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=10m28s">10:28</a><br />It&#39;s actually possible to change it without losing data. I did it myself for my Data Backup drive. (I forgot what that program was called.)exFAT aka FAT64 is little more than an numeric upgrade to FAT32, which made it simple to write a stable read/write driver for Linux.<br /><br />Hell, it&#39;s hardly a driver since mostly all the code does is upgrade lower-capacity variables to a higher capacity, the rest being adding what additional feature exFAT brings.<br /><br />Other than that, this vid is vastly superior to pretty much every similar vid out there. Kudos for that.Terimakasih atas penjelasannya.Thanks for this, kind sir! It&#39;s always nice to see which systems are best for formatting drives. Now, a small rant about those Starbucks flash drives: sure, they&#39;re 8gb to store whatever, and they love to install advertising documents on a separate partitions that in linux read as a CD-ROM drive... when trying to delete it in Gparted it simple does not show. So that USB flash drive has 2 partitions, one that can be reformatted and the ghost cd-rom partition which can&#39;t be touched. Rant over.<br />Thanks for your content!I remember going back to the 1980s a friend had a Wang dedicated word processor. You had to buy floppies formatted in their system. You could not format in the machine. They cost a fortune. Another friend had a bit copier, this was a card that would copy a disk a bit at a time. Used to copy locked games. We copied a new Wang floppy writing to an ordinary disk and it did the job. The proprietary systems are amazing when one system should suffice.ReiserFS anyone?For Linux the best file system I&#39;ve used is XFS.I have recent experience of another difference between filing systems, when trying to copy a file I&#39;d created (in Linux) with a colon in the filename.  I have two 8TB backup drives, and copying to the second (newest) drive was no problem, but the first drive kept complaining.  After a couple of minutes, I twigged that the first drive was formatted as standard as exFAT.  The newer drive I made sure to format before use as NTFS.  Since then, I&#39;ve made sure to use hyphens instead of colons in filenames!I have used IBM&#39;s JFS when performance and least cpusage was desirable. While mature, it is however not very well maintained these days and I wonder how much longer it will remain in upcoming Linux kernels. An alternative to JFS is XFS.Good video to understand File System.<br />However Audio quality is sometimes good, sometimes bad... <br />Another disappointed part is ZFS part.<br /><br /><br />Currently ZFS is developed by Oracle and OpenZFS community.<br />But Oracle&#39;s ZFS and OpenZFS&#39;s ZFS have some differences.<br />Some feature that Oracle ZFS have does not included in OpenZFS version.<br /><br /><br />In my opinion, i think you have to mention that there are two version of ZFS.<br />By the way, good video for newbies. Great work!Great video as always. I don&#39;t know if you celebrate Father&#39;s Day, but a happy one to you if you do.<br /><br />I&#39;m not clear on what you meant about read-only support for Fat32. They still have file and drive (respectively file system and partition) attributes. But there&#39;s definitely no MFT or ACL&#39;s.Uhmmm.... I am wondering. Fat32 was introduced with Win95, back in 1995. Originally named vfat. NTFS was build from the code that MS retained after the OS/2 failure. Hence the first release of NTFS can be used as the filesystem on Os/2 version 2.0 and 2.1 and the other way around. NTFS was not develloped to replace fat32 or any other MS file system. It was develloped to give NT a seperate and dedicated filesystem.ext4 /  LinuxThanks for the video, are always appreciate. <br />Greetings from M√©xico.Dear Chris,<br /><br />As one who&#39;s exceptionally professional, well paced and details-based, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d like to know that the HFS segment has spelling errors, where you&#39;ve put &quot;HSF&quot; in a few times. I don&#39;t want to nitpick, just letting you know; I can&#39;t imagine that editing a title overlay, rendering an  re-uploading would be a huge issue for a man of your calibre. <br /><br />Thank you and God bless you!<br /><br />Matthew.probably the best and concise guide to File Systems I&#39;ve ever seen.Nice video Chris but perhaps you should have mentioned the Convert command which allows you to switch a FAT or FAT32 drive to NTFS without reformatting or losing data. At the command line prompt, just type &#39;convert &lt;drive letter&gt;: /fs:ntfs&#39;  - Easy and painless, and I used to do this as a matter of course to older Windows systems.Correction: NTFS was intended as a replacement of FAT16, not FAT32. NTFS was designed before FAT32, 1993 vs 1996Perfect video at the perfect time.how to convert ... xfat to ntfs <br />with out lusing data ????...<br />please mack A videoError reading FAT, trying SKINNYA problem with exFAT, unlike FAT32, is that it is not open source. The end user often has to pay extra for this functionality on devices. My Synology NAS is a good example. <br /><br />It is amusing how Windows will tell you that 32GB is the limit for FAT32 to try and encourage the use of exFAT.super Awsom <br />videoExcellent tutorial video.  Of course, this is such a huge subject that you could do more on this one day . . . .I am so annoyed. A few days ago I tried to format the SD card which was in my Rock64, so I used SD Card Formatter, which crashed. The drive became inaccessible. Today, I&#39;ve tried doing it again. After plugging it to the computer a dozen Windows will appear and prompts to format the drive. After clicking on formatting, I get an error message. I tried using diskpart to format the drive, but diskpart doesn&#39;t give me an option to write in text, except if I plug the SD card out. Is there any hope, something I should try, or is the SD card dead?I filled a USB stick full of music to plug into my new car stereo only to find that you have to plug a phone into the socket to use he sat nav, so then I though &#39;i&#39;ll put a raspberry pi in the glove box and either use the av in on the stereo or Bluetooth. But of course the av cable is wired slightly differently on the pi, and the audio wouldn&#39;t have been great anyway. ANYWAY turns out the USB stick wasn&#39;t exfat so I couldn&#39;t  see the files anyway. Guess I need to use Linux to copy the files over?Thank you Christopher! Did you use a different microphone, starting at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=5m07s">5:07</a>? The sound is just a tiny bit muffled with a slight interference buzz.I&#39;ve also been caught out by the 4Gb limit when copying TS video files. One hour of HD can easily exceed 4Gb yet some media players still can only handle FAT32Thanx Chris!I also had the same problem üòÄInteresting stuff.  I was aware of the various Windows and Linux file systems, but I don‚Äôt remember coming across FAT12.Thank you for this videoAlthough Windows will format a drive, to be fat32, note that the formatting will fail if the drive is larger than 32 GB.  That is, if you use whatever formatting tools are native to Windows (whether using the GUI (graphical user interface) or via the <a href="http://format.com/">format.com</a> command line option).<br /><br />There are many 3rd party tools (some are free and very good) that you can use to format lager-than-32GB-drives to use fat32.<br /><br />So, for example, if you purchased a 128 GB flash drive, or a 2 TB external drive, etc, you can use the free MiniTool Partition program (www.partitionwizard.com) to format your drive(s) to fat32 (or other formats).  Once formatted, Windows will work with the large fat32 drive with no problems.<br /><br />I believe that for backwards compatibility with older Windows versions (Win98 or WinXP, 32 bit versions), current day Windows will not format fat32 beyond 32 GB, because the older OS&#39;s could not handle larger than 32 GB fat32 drives.  I guess that when folks were transitioning away from WinXP to Win7 (64 bit), they did not want folks to use their Win7 OS to format a 64 GB drive as fat32, only to have that drive fail when used in the still popular (for that era) WinXP computers.  And Microsoft has never changed this position, even with their current Win10 OS.<br /><br />Cheers!That are a lot of file systems. I remember CFS. That&#39;s the Card File System used by the Rolodex operating system ü§îTY!i find ext4 is so much faster than ntfs especially when im installing games on steam,it takes longer on a windows system than a linux system.I have some questions about NTFS, some of which could be worth another video:<br />1. why many programs including Windows Explorer have problems with file path names longer 256 characters?<br />2. why is search in Windows Explorer so hard, slow and unreliable? Tools which use MFT are incredible fast and it‚Äôs a shame for Microsoft you need third party tools for a reliable recursive search in file data. <br />3. why Windows Explorer is so slow changing directorys on a Windows fileserver?<br />4. why sometimes Windows Explorer doesn‚Äôt show recent changes in a folder, even when renaming files or folders?<br />5. why are there so many problems with locked files under NTFS and no native tools to solve or analyze them, e.g. when deleting folders with thumbs.db in it, old Office temp files, and locked files on removable devices, which cannot be removed safely despite I run no operations on that device. <br />As an admin, I‚Äòm not about to choose my OS, but in case of Filesystems and tools I‚Äòd rather choose something different than NTFS/Windows.Hello Sir, please shed some light on Android compatibility. <br /><br />I highly appreciate your content, i know its based upon general computing and not android.

So I have no clue what you are talking about, I still enjoy though.NTFS format under Linux, how unnatural.Hi interesting video. I have a question that&#39;s kind of related to the subject. I built my ryzen pc with two 240gb ssd drives. one is for windows the other for linux mint19. I intend on adding a 2tb hdd for storage of image and video files. I use applications on both windows and linux for editing , what is the best way to make this drive visible and usable for both operating systems.Years ago when migrating files from Windows to Linux I ran into another oddity called NTFS streams - only a few files were affected, but I can&#39;t remember now what I had to do to copy the data. IIRC streams allow multiple chunks of data to be associated with one file, similar to resource forks on pre-OS X Macs. <br /><br />ZIP-ing files is a good way of preserving file attributes across file systems, and can speed up copying when there are lots of small files.<br /><br /><br />Another gotcha is when restoring files from a read-only device like CD/DVD - all your file attributes are changed to read-only unless you zipped them up first.As usual, very great. I&#39;ve worked with Solaris and SunOS for about 30 years. ZFS is probably the FS I&#39;m most impressed with, but the company I work for has transitioned to Linux VMs and so mostly I work with ext4 recently. Of course on Windows servers, NTFS is the staple FS I work with. ZFS has lots of features, but would require too much time and depth to be discussed here. Thanks so much for putting out these videos. No matter how long I have worked in the IT business, I always get something out of your channel each and every episode.You were wrong to state that NTFS and EXT4 prevent corruption. I live in a country with a number of power fails per day and I can assure you, that I lost a lot of music, due to file corruption in EXT4. The directory structure is recovered by NTFS and EXT4, but damage inside a file NOT, because e.g. only half the file is overwritten, then the crash occurs and the other half is still old and incompatible. Only ZFS and BTRFS solve that problem.<br />I&#39;m a great fan of ZFS, it is by far the superior file system. The only problem is, that it is not yet supported by the installer, so it is relatively difficult to boot from ZFS. However ZFS is great for storage of e.g. virtual machines. BTRFS is supported by the installers, however it has some reliability issues with the more complex Raid configurations. ZFS does not really support 32-bits anymore, while BTRFS still supports 32-bit computers. Both systems are based on &quot;Copy on Write&quot;, so they never corrupt the file structure nor files themselves.  Both systems support compression on the volume level and both systems have great memory caching of disk IO. ZFS also supports SSD caching. Basically with ZFS you can build a 3-level storage hierarchy close to StoreMI on all Linux system for free. On my system 93% of all disk IO is served from the memory cache. It results in e.g. instantaneous response times in the VM and reboots of a Linux OS VM in 6-8 seconds from memory cache.Nice explanationAh, very useful info thanks!There&#39;s also ReiserFS, which is named after a murderer...I really appreciate this video.  Thank you.Have always been meaning to understand the differences and which I should be using, thanks for the comprehensive guide and all in 11 mins!Good stuff :)........ Linux will read just about any file system you throw at it. It can&#39;t be beaten for cross platform compatibility... and that&#39;s why I live in Linux.can u explain Huawei EROFS<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=6m18s">6:18</a> HFS+ != HSF+The MBR must accompany the filesystem to be accessed by Windows. MacOSX Yosemite and El Capitan disk utility app do not allow to write the MBR when you choose MSDOS format. What a weirdness from Apple!! Why someone would want to format MSDOS without any MS Windows compatibility???!! Fortunately, BSD (as an underlayer of MacOSX) contains diskutil which is very powerful and allow me to write the MBR.This is quite a surprisingly interesting videoSome basic information you need to know. Thanks Chris.Just a note to anyone who needs the info:  You can still buy a case of 100 - 1.44 MB 3.5&quot; diskettes on Amazon for 85 dollars.                You&#39;re welcome!very informative. i too recently ran into the 4gig barrier and was confused as to the issue.. then it dawned on me..Terima kasih banyak untuk ilmunya..<br />Sekarang saya jadi tahu untuk format file sistem yang cocok untuk setiap drive..<br /><br />Terima kasih banyak ilmunya..<br />Salam dari indonesia..Hi Chris, great informative video as always, kinda getting used to it by now. Just wanna add a small tip, most car infotainment systems use FAT32 format. They will not play nice with other file formats, even exFAT. For example, I have a JVC KWV10 device which ONLY accepts FAT32, took me a long time to figure out why my USB media was not playing, but once I switched to FAT32, all was well. Thanks again and keep them coming good Sir! :-)Thanks for an excellent video on filesystems. Since I have been formally out of IT education and support for a decade, I have lost track of specifications of the newer filesystem as well as being mostly Windows user until recently. The video provided me with the opportunity to update my knowledge of filesystems. I am always thankful for the valuable information you provide.I was lucky I choose FAT32 for my 32GB drive......Another excellent resource for new enthusiasts!Good informative video, but you fail to mention that journaling adds writes and thus extra wear to a SD card or USB drive. Because of that I try to stick with FAT32, or with EXT2 or F2FS. But the latter two are not widely supported, so only for specific use cases. (As my OS is Linux based, I don&#39;t have problems using any FS, but a lot are not compatible with stand alone devices. Mostly only support FAT32.)<br />Also, you might have mentioned that exFAT is a Microsoft proprietary FS. So, a lot of manufacturers of stand alone devices will not pay the license fee and will not support it.Hey Chris, I run in to the same problem you had in the field sometimes. I realize my mistake and copy the data off the drive reformat it copy the data back and problem solved. I love the SBC stuff, but this kind of real world information is really helpful for me. Nice refresher course. Thanks and Happy Father&#39;s Day to all the Dad&#39;s out there!I think it would also be interesting to see performance differences between the file systems.Aw man, just a day too late!<br />Just cloned another HDD to SSD yesterday and I was wondering again what the differences were between all of these.<br />Great video, nonetheless! I always love learning.Christopher Barnatt, the best teacher.If the storage is external and big, it&#39;s exFAT all the way.  NTFS would be nice but it&#39;s proprietary.really great video.Excellent video. Very instructive. Where do you get your ideas for your videos?Thanks Chris. I wish everyone I try to help would watch this LOL. &quot;Why can&#39;t you just transfer the file? Why do you have to put it into chunks like that?&quot; Etc etc LOL.<br />Mind you, I did start on DOS 3 so maybe that helps me out ;) But it can be confusing for sure.<br />Thanks again for your help :)Excellent video! I can see myself returning to this video again and again in the future for a concise refresher on this topic. Your channel is such a rarity on YouTube, it is educational, funny and engaging. Please keep making these wonderful videos.My first PC had the HPFS on OS/2<br /><br />As I read here BTRFS for Linux, ReactOS is supporting it now tooWhat is UDF ... Chopped Liver?   I have been able to format external flash drives as Universal Drive Format and it is readable on all file systems (writable on most).  I can see why UDF was left out ...  nobody cares -- but everybody has it  (on Data DVDs)Great video Chris, always wondered what the difference was between the various file systems!Imagine if NTFS was an open standard<br />This comment was made by the ext4 gangI remember my first experience with NTFS was with Windows NT 4.0.¬† Eventually I needed to make that PC a duel boot system with Win98 so I could play games.¬† Did you ever run Win NT?WHAT!?!?!?!<br /><br />&quot;...the only way to change a filesystem is to format the drive...&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps if you&#39;re only using the tools that come with Windows itself... but not if you&#39;re using third party partition managers...<br /><br />For example I changed from MBR to QPT a few years ago WITHOUT having to completly empty the drive...<br /><br />You also forgot the HPFS (High Performance File System)¬†that OS/2 used...It seems there is work on the ZFS windows port: <a href="https://github.com/openzfsonwindows/ZFSin">https://github.com/openzfsonwindows/ZFSin</a>Another fantastic video.+ExplainingComputer / Christopher,<br />A great explanation about file systems. I am glad that you talked about the compatibility issues between NTFS / exFAT and stand-alone consumer devices (a question that I do get asked about on a fairly regularly basis, especially with users that own &quot;Smart&quot; televisions, smartphones, media players and other devices).<br /><br />I wondering about your stance in relation to other file systems (as an example, do you agree with SUSE about the stability of BTRFS or do you agree with Red Hat, which believes that BTRFS is not currently suitable for production usage)?<br /><br />Btw, I know that other viewers have pointed this out but within one of your slides, there is a typo (you have included HSF+ but the correct abbreviation is HFS+).You should have mentioned XFS, which is a very common (and more solid) filesystem for Linux.<br /><br />Otherwise, this video gives a good overview for not so tech-savy people, which is very fine.Good lord, yet ANOTHER great video.  Every time I watch your videos I am amazed what you dig up.  If you are not in the teaching profession, you have missed your calling sir, because you do such a good job at it for the thousands of us on the other side of your monitor.It&#39;s hard to know when to stop listing file systems.  IIRC, fdisk on Linux offered 83 choices, the last time I looked. <br /><br />At the OS level, there&#39;s a bit of a religious war in progress (Red Hat vs Suse) between ZFS and Btrfs, (Btrfs, often pronounced &quot;ButterFS&quot; or &quot;BetterFS, stands for B-tree File System, B-tree being the logical structure used.) <br /><br />Fortunately, anyone on the user-facing side of administrator usually doesn&#39;t have to give an ISRP, because that&#39;s below their horizon.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=6m55s">6:55</a> Chris, most Linux distros do have out of the box support for mounting HFS or HFS+ disks, but require a couple more packages from the repositories to manipulate these partitions. APFS is not natively supported in even modern Linux distros as far as I know.Finally a video that explains them all properly.  Thank you.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=6m25s">6:25</a> In the line starting with &quot;in 1998,&quot; you meant HFS+ instead of HSF+, Chris!Hi Chris, as a matter of interest I have a music centre here with a USB socket on, and I couldn&#39;t get anything to work with it, I thought I had messed it up, then I saw a clip on here by a Japanese person who was having  same trouble, he said format it with FAT32 and then try it again, and it worked, looks like with this music centre you have to format it in FAT32 to make the mp3 music files play on this thing...nothing else will recognise...from Fred in Essex.Great video and everything is clearly explained.This video comes at a perfect time. I just recently had an issue where I bought a MicroSD card that&#39;s 256GB and it wasn&#39;t working in the intended location I bought it for. (A Linux laptop with a MicroSD slot.) As it turns out, I may have neglected to add exFAT support to the distro and so it didn&#39;t acknowledge the MicroSD. That being said, I have to also make sure that the SD standard it&#39;s setup with is correct for the size, since anything under SDXC would be insufficient for the card size.Ex fat went on a diet! üòéGood Stuff Sir !<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=09m55s">09:55</a>   The dragon in the room that everyone pretends to ignore: software written by idiots who refuse to provide explanations in the application which will inform the hapless user of just what caused things to suddenly go pear-shaped. When there is a failure accompanied by no explanation of what happened AND there is no indication of how to recover, then you are dealing with a product designed and written and sold by people who truly despise you.Very informative video, it is not that easy to find good information on file systems i feel.Regarding the ZFS format. If Z =Zed, why doesn‚Äôt F = Fed and S = Sed?  LOL, just kidding.  Your videos are always very informative.  Thanks!I have a corrupted 32 gig phone card it will not format is there a way it can be repaired? or formatted to work at a smaller size?One addition, if you use both Linux and Windows then it is handy to store data on a partition (but maybe better not in the user directories of Windows). That way you can access your files on both Linux and Windows. It is inconvenient if you can&#39;t access your files which you stored on ext4 (typically the home-folder of Linux) while you run Windows.Incompatibility between NTFS and EXT4 is a pain. <br />Hopefully, after 2020 I will no longer have a windows machine. <br />Hello Linux Mint, good riddance Windblows.62nd.... Do I get a medal for participating?Great vid. Do I remember an older file system called MDFM? Sure I used to have that type of disk drive until my clear-out in 2000. Loving the compatibility comparisons in the vid. I use both Windows and Mac computers, as well as other hardware, so my &#39;go to&#39; format is FAT32, it works with everything I have. Yes, it&#39;s a bit outdated now. But I can use almost¬†any¬†type of storage with this format in any device, and just pass it on or download it.¬†The first memory stick I owned was in 1999, a present from IBM.I use all types of solid state storage now. Some are bespoke, and need stupidly priced kit to download the content. Would you spend over ¬£200 just to get a reader for a ¬£400 memory card? Yep. I did.I always try to go for the lowest common denominator. That&#39;s why FAT32 is my go-to. And about 64Gb my normal storage for a swappable card limit.Can we please see more vid.s like this?Thnx never knew the difference,Apple systems are new for me.<br />Never used Apple.<br />Ext 2 is usable  for linux too ,I thought.Good show as alwaysA follow up video could be which drives are wipeable with free tools like DBAN.Happy fathers Day !!<br />\(œã)/‚ô©‚ô™ ‚îå|‚àµ|‚îò‚ô™  ‚îî|‚àµ|‚îê‚ô™‚ô™  (~‚Äæ‚ñø‚Äæ)~  \(^œâ^\ )Could you do a follow up in more detail explaining how journaling works, how the tables work, redundancy, etc. That would be great! :)Fat32 is like American measurement system <br />Old school.<br />I don&#39;t even remember using that fat32 file system.What about f2fsFirst eXFAT is 100% compatible with Linux, second, you forget BTRFS, XFS, and others. Today ext4 is not the best choice, BTRFS is the most used FS.<br />HFS, HFS+ you can read and right on Linux system, the worsted FS is NTFS.XFS is also very common on linuxI try to run btrfs on my Linux root partitions as much as possible because of its snapshot capabilities.Also remember folks if You are still rocking windows 9x and FAT32 you cannot access an external drive formatted in NTFS.i&#39;ve used FAT32 for my flash drive &amp; transfer some videos from PC &amp; played on a LED TV with a USB port built-in, but I&#39;ve got frustuated when i&#39;ve played the video, &amp; video is corrupted, so FAT32 can be good but bad experience, same goes for storing documents &amp; ended up corrupted file, in the end, FAT32 is way OUT &amp; re-format to NTFS, good thing that my LED TV accepts flashdrives with NTFS formats.Hello Chris, nice to see you again, Happy Father¬¥s day, My favorite File System is the ZFS File System it is so robust, I use it with TrueOS, I even managed to recuperate a sector damaged hard drive.@ExplainingComputer Typo on &quot;NFTS&quot; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=4m44s">4:44</a>)NTFS was derived from the superb DEC VMS ODS-2 File System as part of a technology sharing agreement between Microsoft and Digital Equipment Corp. Nothing equals it for reliability and manageability. Microsoft shared it&#39;s low level code for Server Message Block so DEC could integrate it tightly into VMS. A true win-win.As always clear concise explanations. Very helpful as today we are jumping from one system to another sometimes without almost thinking. I only recently got one of those memory sticks with two ports, one usb for the PC the other for micro usb for connecting directly to smart phone.  Ideal for quickly moving my photos etc. it&#39;s 32gb in capacity and exFat just in case there&#39;s a video file... I also suffered a 4gb file transfer problem in the past and it took me ages to work it out.Very informative! I wish I saw this before making a Windows USB installer. It would have save me so much time and stopped so many headaches.Great video, but it would have also helped to mention that exFAT is proprietary which is the reason it&#39;s not widely supported, as if you want to support it on your device/operating system, you have to pay Microsoft royalties. (and Linux does not come with it because it&#39;s free and open source)Very informative, thank you Christopher.I find it hard to believe we‚Äôre in 2019 and there is not a common file system across all devices.  Still goes to show that all the operating systems are still silos for their own methods of madness.  Good video Chris!A high noise level on this one during the explanation of the systems (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=2m30s">2:30</a> , @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws&amp;t=5m07s">5:07</a> it starts again). Fan of the laptop or too much amplification?Excellent video!This video is very interesting.Thanks for the video. I learned we once had &#39;FAT12&#39; from this video.I find it annoying with MS&#39;s royalty fees as well that SDXC Cards won&#39;t work with most Android phones as well as the Pi.  Nintendo Switch, however it appears that it DOES support exFAT SDXC cards which is great news for players who want to buy more Switch Games from eShop. But you best off buying a 400GB or 256GB SD card and BE SURE NOT TO LOSE THAT TINY MICRO SD CARD WITH YOUR PRECIOUS SAVES! Whew...sorry for that exaggeration shout, but having to buy SD Cards near 512GB for over ¬£150 and losing it will cost a lot of fortune.Awesome man, thank you, this is maybe why I can&#39;t get this x86 or bliss written to a laptop I haveAs alternative to ZFS, BTRFS exists for Linux :)<br />For USB drives etc, F2FS exists :)Amazing video!! Thank you üôèSo Many things to learn üòÑHmmmm where to begin,<br /><br /><br />Well no one &#39;Not using Winblows&#39; uses these crusty filesystems.  You missed Btrfs, yaffs, xfs even ReiserFS and a whole host of others natively supported in Linux.  On Linux you are wrong, you can use any of the supported filesystems as per the Linux kernel.<br /><br /><br />Ive used many variants over the years as a boot / storage on both Lilo and Grub/Grub2.<br /><br /><br />I understand that it is most likely the Canonical / Ubuntu way but they are not Linux ;).5 likes with only 1 view üòÇ<br /><br /><br />Youtube is on Drugs again..Nice video although you didn&#39;t cover ReFS which may replace NTFS one day :)This videos push learning at a higher level, something that youtube is missingYou have made an error with HFS+, you wrote HSF+ :)<br />Other than that, great video!exFAT sounds like a fad diet or weight reduction drug to the not-so-tech literate.Good lesson, thank you!I&#39;ve got  exFAT  around my Torso...Great video, greetings from Albania!!!!!!!hi ec, please do a video on    gpt  mbr disk types etcGreetings from Western Australia! Thankyou for your video.Was just looking this up for a course i&#39;m doing, perfect timing indeedChose ZFS whenever an option :)<br /><br /><br />APFS also is the volume manager. Its basically a clone of ZFS.Nice video sir.I am using that Linux utility to flash os on USB.Good Morning! Glad to see you and happy fathers day!You look exactly like my Dad. Only different hair style.I was studying Operating System Memory Management and You upload this. Wawwww. ThanksGreeting from Kuala Lumpur!Thailand here!Good morning my friend üò¨
